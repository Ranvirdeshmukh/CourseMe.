# ✅ FIXED - Add Button Not Changing to "Added"

## The Problem

When clicking "Add" on a winter course:
- ✅ Course WAS being saved to Firestore successfully  
- ❌ Button WASN'T changing from "Add" to "Remove"
- ❌ Course didn't appear as "added" in the UI

## Root Cause

**Section Number Mismatch in Comparison Logic**

Your winter courses have empty section fields:
```javascript
// Course in table
{ subj: "AAAS", num: "20.01", sec: "" }

// Course after saving (we default empty to "01")
{ subj: "AAAS", num: "20.01", sec: "01" }

// Comparison was failing!
"" === "01"  // false ❌
```

So even though the course was saved, the UI thought it wasn't added because the section numbers didn't match.

## The Fix - 3 Places Updated

### 1. **TimetableGrid.jsx** - Line 1275
Button state comparison now normalizes sections:

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
selectedCourses.some(
  (c) => c.subj === course.subj && c.num === course.num && c.sec === course.sec
)
```

**NOW:**
```javascript
selectedCourses.some(
  (c) => c.subj === course.subj && c.num === course.num && (c.sec || '01') === (course.sec || '01')
)
```

### 2. **useCourses.js** - Line 208
Duplicate check now normalizes sections:

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const alreadyAdded = selectedCourses.some(
  (c) => c.subj === course.subj && c.num === course.num && c.sec === course.sec
);
```

**NOW:**
```javascript
const alreadyAdded = selectedCourses.some(
  (c) => c.subj === course.subj && c.num === course.num && (c.sec || '01') === (course.sec || '01')
);
```

### 3. **courseService.js** - Line 300
Remove course filter now normalizes sections:

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
return !(c.subj === course.subj && 
        c.num === course.num && 
        c.sec === course.sec);
```

**NOW:**
```javascript
return !(c.subj === course.subj && 
        c.num === course.num && 
        (c.sec || '01') === (course.sec || '01'));
```

## What This Means

Now when comparing courses, empty sections (`""`) are treated as `"01"`:
- ✅ Course with `sec: ""` matches saved course with `sec: "01"`
- ✅ Button changes immediately to "Remove" (Delete icon)
- ✅ UI correctly shows course as "added"

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Add"** on a winter course with `sec: ""`
2. **Course saves** to Firestore with `sec: "01"` (our default)
3. **selectedCourses updates** with the saved course (`sec: "01"`)
4. **Comparison runs**: `("" || "01") === ("01" || "01")` → `"01" === "01"` ✅
5. **Button changes** to Delete icon
6. **Course appears** as added in UI

## Testing

1. Clear cache: `localStorage.clear(); location.reload();`
2. Click "Add" on any winter course
3. Button should **immediately** change to Delete icon (red)
4. Course should appear in "My Courses"
5. ProfilePage should show the course in Winter 2026 Timetable

## Summary

The courses WERE being saved all along - you just couldn't see it because the button state wasn't updating! Now it will work perfectly. 🎉
