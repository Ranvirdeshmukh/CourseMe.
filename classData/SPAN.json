Then, class was discussion-based, but Prof Gomez did a good job of giving the discussions some structure, and bringing in formal film techniques, while letting us (mostly) guide the discussion. Assignments and grading made sense and felt fair; included attendance, participation, two 3 pg essays where we compared one aspect of two films, a 10 pg final essay where we did the same but longer, and a presentation in class about a film.

I thought that the material was very interesting and the films that we watched were very good and unforgettable. The wide variety of genres of the films were great because you were guaranteed to like at least a few of the films. The class structure is the first half of class was discussion of the film we were assigned for homework led by a student and then we watch about half of another film that we need to finish for homework. Each week we had discussion posts about the films and we had 2 short (about 3 pgs) papers that were quite easy and straight forward. The final paper was 5-8 pages and it was very free for you to write about whatever films interested you. Rodolfo as a professor is kind of nice but there are times where he is a bit passive aggressive. There are also times where he just talks and talks for over half an hour and it's hard to keep track of the point he wants to get across. This class is definitely a layup, but requires a large time commitment since there are many films you need to watch and they are pretty much all close to 2hrs in length. His grading is pretty lax but he is very critical if you are just saying something about the film that is \"obvious\" because he wants you to think about the films more critically.\""

That being said, the class isn't ALL fun and games aka tango dancing; you also have to do lots of readings and analyzing lyrics and such. It's a whole term learning about tango so you really get into the nitty gritty of it and I wasn't ESPECIALLY interested, so I often didn't really do the readings; this just meant that my class participation was kind of mediocre and if we got into groups to discuss I wouldn't have much to say lol. My advice if you're like me and don't want to do all the tedious readings every night is pick one and just read until you can find something to raise your hand and say something interesting in class about it cause the discussions are fairly open-ended. My classmates did a pretty good job of really giving insightful comments though so the bar was not low. I also had trouble with the essays, mostly because the prompts felt kind of vague and hard to work with but she is helpful if you speak to her directly (don't wait till after the deadline like I did). Obviously, the part where we actually learned to dance was really fun; this was maybe every other class in reality, but there was one week where some professional teachers visited and we had some classes with them that were really fun, and then watched them perform along with the quartet that was also visiting. That was a fun week. For the final project you either write a paper that I think required ~8-10 pages, or do a creative project and a 5 page reflection (I forget the numbers exactly) so I opted for the latter and made a shitty painting that she actually really liked. Other kids got in groups and just performed a dance somewhere on campus which would probably have been a lot simpler lol.\""

There are not a ton of assignments in the first part of the term, but things start to pick up after that.

Noelia is really nice and seems to want to help support students who reach out, but she definitely graded with more scrutiny than was applied in the other 50-level Spanish course I've taken here.

            "review 1: \"05W with Silvia Spitta: In short, this is by far the worst course I have ever takeng in my four years at Dartmouth with the worst profesor I have ever encountered here. My main objection with this course is that the published title \"Latin American Literature\" had abosultely no relation to the actual course that was taught (ORC gives no description for the course for good reason). Prof Spitta chose, instead of Latin American Literature, to organize the course around the theme of her new book: Objects. She feels that society has trouble separating the objective from the subjective, at least I think that is what she was saying, and wanted to impress the fact upon her class over the course of a ten week class. While the topic itself is interesting, this has NO place in the Spanish department, let alone as a senior seminar meant to be the culminating experience for many majors. If Spitta wants to lecture (and by lecture I mean show slide shows of photos she found on the internet) about objects, she should do so in another department: Sociology, Anthropology, even Theater would have been more appropriate. Our readings were overwhelmingly in English, which seems antithetical to the study of Spanish, and were pulled from anthropological journals, not, say, Latin American Literature. Class discussions were unenlightening and unenthusiastic as students had little interest in the subject and no real idea what Spitta was driving at. Periodic one-page essays required no real thought or analysis. We read approximately three items which would could have been considered Latin American Literature but never actually wrote on them; we discussed these readings in class only as related to objects, never in the context of Latin American Literatures. My growing dissatisfaction with the Spanish department was exponentially amplified by this class. The course did nothing to help me practice or perfect my Spanish language skills let alone culminate the study thereof. This course, under this title with this profesor. has no place in the Spanish department let alone as a senior seminar or culminating experience.\"",

More generally, she is an extremely kind person. The class involves a lot of progressive theories about neoliberalism, capitalism, inequality, and social justice. It focuses on the human experience in the West (so it goes beyond modern Spain, although Spanish life does come up a bit). A fair amount of the texts will be in English. Be sure to meet the basic bar of coming to class and participating, and I recommend doing at least some of the reading. But she cares most about attendance-- if you come to class and talk a little bit, you'll do well! You kind of get out of the class what you put in, although the class does involve a fair bit of group work and it was pretty enjoyable for me! Major assignments included three student presentations, including two on a text and one on a film (this isn't as hard as it sounds); 3 group blog posts for a group of three (so each student does one); 1 group essay; and pretty manageable midterm and final group projects that students do together (I think I spent a total of 3 hours on each of the projects). Also, I probably did an hour, two at most if there was a movie, of work before each class period and I finished with an A. You might not learn a ton about modern Spain, but you will improve your Spanish and it won't be a stressful or overly difficult class. It's likely that your peers in the class will be great students and human beings, so you can learn a lot from them and Prof Martin!\""

It's still a great class if push through and understand everything, a background in studying Latin (even if just a little - knowing declensions and verb conjugations) is a big help.

After reading the ORC description, I was really excited to read medieval texts and see how the language was changing (especially since I had just taken Spanish 30, medieval lit, in the fall). However, the whole class was simply memorizing methods for transforming Latin words into Spanish words. The information was useful, but the way that Prof. Lozano presented it was rather confusing and somewhat poorly explained. There was bsically no work except the midterm and final. The final was not well explained. Although we \"analyzed\" an excerpt from 'el Cid' the actual paper/project entailed analyzing or commenting on each word individually. Essentially, there was no critical reading or analysis of any literature except in the context of looking at individual words. I would still recommend taking the class, since the subject is useful in understanding the Spanish language. I guess I would suggest going to office hours to make sure you know exactly what is expected of you though.\"",

The course was excruciatingly slow with zero readings and almost no homework. As a linguistics major, this course was entirely inadequate. As a Spanish minor, I wish the course had been able to tie the history of the language to the history of Spain and show where words had been borrowed from and what kind of words had been borrowed.

The class focuses on the evolution of words from Latin to Spanish, and most of the class is spent learning rules to evolve Latin into Spanish. I found this course interesting because it helps me when I'm reading early texts, say from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, so if you're very very interested in those materials, i would recommend the class, but if you're just looking for a Spanish credit, you should go take a lit. course - it would be much more interesting for most students in the long run.\"",

This class is not your typical spanish class -- you'll have only tests, no papers, and no reading.

But if you have any interest in either Latin, or the evolution of the Spanish language -- or language in general -- then you will love this class. Not a large amount of work throughout the term, but expect to spend a fair amount of time on the final (a take-home) -- very unstressful class in general.

He was unbothered and not super communicative with the other profs when we had constructive feedback, but idc about that tbh. He graded us VERY subjectively. Like he gave us all really good feedback and adequate grades on our quality of essay writing, presentations, and etc. but PARTICIPATION somehow ended up being the distinguishing grade marker. Like ?? He either liked you and you got a 9 or a 10 or he didn\u2019t and you got a 7 or an 8. Literally participation set the curve and people got Bs or As depending. My grade dropped 7 points for getting a 9 instead of a 10. How the fuck is that fair? He even told me if I wasn\u2019t so tardy I would\u2019ve gotten a 10, like, I was late maybe twice the entire term but he took notice and remembered. There were people much later much more consistently than me who got better grades and vice versa. Like, that is so unfair. And I did not expect that from him because he was very chill until that point. And he repeatedly called us disrespectful and whiny when we validly complained about the shortcomings in this lesson plan but he assured us this wouldn\u2019t happen but look where we are. ON that, he doesn\u2019t deserve to have an opinion. Like he STOPPEd coming on excursion with us because \u201cthey\u2019re excessive and I want to maximize my time in Madrid with my family\u201d. Like, he is our whole director and then he holds it against us for being tired and like we aren\u2019t busy 4 days a week after class for hours at a time with freaking different tours and activities. Like cmon. Also he straight up didn\u2019t care that we all live 40 minutes away on public transport and had class at 9:15 everyday when we eat dinner with our hosts at midnight everyday. He also didn\u2019t communicate with any of the other professors, EVER. Like so many problems in scheduling could\u2019ve been avoided if he just sent them an email. Like this is lack of self arragont lack pride, lack of consideration for everyone\u2019s time is something I notice with all the European Academics but the Spanish Department really dropped the ball. Like, it wasn\u2019t all bad, but cmon we had COVID cases weekly, people missed class validly and he held it AGAINST us. We left reviews and hopefully hangs are made overall, but it was a bad taste to end my time in Madrid. Also on his material, he didn\u2019t even teach that well. He repeated the exact same memorized content from previous spanish classes and every other class he didn\u2019t even teach, he had a student present for the whole class. Like there was one reading that was so obscure and his review was the ONLY academic literature available about it. That was the case for so many readings, like he only wants to share his opinions and was always trying to argue in is favor when we\u2019d bring up opposing perspectives. Like, it\u2019s very subjective and I don\u2019t like that style of teaching. He didn\u2019t respect the grammar class enough either. All in all, this program was lead by profs who had some very snobbish mannerisms and stubborn prides. Spain is a super cool city and I am so glad I came here, exploring the city and doing something different every night was fun.

            "review 1: \"23F with Sara Munoz Muriana: Normally I don't write layuplist reviews. This is an exception because I wrote this as a cathartic exercise to submit to the guanini folks for a survey and felt it could be worth sharing here as well. This was by far and away the most disorganized, uninteresting, and frustrating course I have taken in my three years at Dartmouth. I am absolutely shocked that this term cost more than an equivalent one in Hanover as the quality of instruction by Dartmouth faculty, program organization, and institutional support was laughable. This is by no means a commentary on the local professors, Ruben, Leonor, and Laura: their courses were incredibly engaging and extremely valuable. Instead I am focusing only on the instruction and organization of program director Sara Mu\u00f1oz. I. SPAN 36: This course had no defining thesis nor even a meaningful theme. Topics ranged from domestic abuse to short stories to life of Francisco Goya with no real link. Instead it seemed to be a conglomeration of whatever Prof. Mu\u00f1oz found interesting at the time, blown far out of proportion into bloated mass of academia babble in order to give it some sort of forced meaning.For example, for our class we were required to write a \u2018microcuenta,\u2019 with no guidance on length or content. We met in class, and after being scolded for writing stories that were \u2018too long,\u2019 we read each and tried to discern the meaning while the anonymous author sat literally right among us. I can\u2019t properly express how ridiculous it felt to try to impart our own fake-deep meaning on a story that the author would confirm later had no such intent. Furthermore, Sara kept us an extra 35 minutes after class should have ended so we could finish all 12 stories because again, they were \u2018too long.\u2019 Prof Mu\u00f1oz was also expected you to share your opinion and despite stating repeatedly that there are \u2018no wrong answers\u2019 would refuse to accept contradictory opinions. Prior to our excursion to Toledo we watched a film about domestic abuse set in the old city (a truly fantastic introduction to the area) and spent the last 30 minutes of class arguing with her over an interpretation of male stereotypes. Ironically, it was effectively the same opinion phrased in a different way, but she refused to hear our explanations and instead maintained that we were categorically wrong. Our assessments in the class were two short reflections on the excursions where we had to talk about how looking at dozens of identical romanesque cathedrals was personally meaningful. Then we were graded on grammatical accuracy including rules that we had no way of knowing (i.e. only the first word in a title is capitalized in spain). Again, if you expressed an opinion that she did not agree with you were marked down. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Mu\u00f1oz is a very engaging lecturer and does an excellent job of bringing her students into the discussion. I have no qualms with the classroom structure nor the way that the content was presented, but I feel that the content itself could have been weaved into a much more cohesive narrative and wish Prof. Mu\u00f1oz would have been more accepting of a variety of perspectives. II. Program organization and Excursions: This, to me, was the most frustrating part of my entire experience in Spain. If done well, I can certainly see how academic-minded trips to important locations around the country could be incredibly meaningful experiences that would reinforce the content covered in class. Instead, they felt like haphazard middle-school field trips. Rarely did we receive the itinerary for our weekend excursions earlier than a day or two in advance of our departure, making planning anything in a 24-hour window around our arrival and departure nearly impossible. Not that it mattered, of course; the itinerary we received was always very vague and rarely accurate. It often promised unstructured time in the afternoons that never actually happened, and instead we ended up back at our hotel at 9 pm or later every night, just in time for dinner. We were confronted with 10-12 hour days of walking tours that often had little significance to our cultural understanding of Spain. Hercules beetles are cool I guess, but I feel like that time would have been much better spent exploring the cities we were staying in. I can\u2019t even count the number of cathedrals and churches we visited over the course of our excursions because they all blend together. Spain has an incredibly varied and complex history, so to focus almost entirely on the construction of catholic cathedrals is a disservice to the hundreds of years we didn\u2019t even mention let alone study. The disorganization of the program was striking. Ruben, Leonor, and Laura clearly weren\u2019t made aware of our schedule, either: they were just as surprised as us to learn that we would be absent for most of a week in October. One time, after Sara tested positive for COVID after we were all stuck in a bus together for several hours (and didn\u2019t tell us until several days after she tested!!!! Like what) we were told that the excursion the following weekend would likely be postponed. Having tested negative, I made plans to travel elsewhere that Friday. Several days passed without a word. Then, late Thursday afternoon we were told to meet at the train station the next morning. When my friend and I stated we had already bought tickets and still hoped to go, Prof Mu\u00f1oz threatened to fail us for all three of our classes. It ultimately worked out and we were able to go on our way, but this response still feels way out of proportion with what we were requesting: skipping a two-hour tour of a small town outside of Madrid. I think the intention with this program was excellent, but the execution could be improved substantially. I would have liked to see more independence for students on excursions and advanced notice of schedule changes and pertinent information. Incorporation of student input for excursion itineraries would go a long way towards improving the quality of the excursions. For example, on our final day in Galicia we were presented with the option to relax on the beach or continue exploring the south side of one of the islands we visited. Some chose to stay, others to go. This is the type of autonomy I have come to expect from adult life and what I would hope to see for future students. In its current form, I felt this program was not worth the cost. I feel that I could have organized my own experience or participated in an exchange program through another school and obtained nearly the same cultural and linguistic understanding at a fraction of the price. Granted without Dartmouth credit, but I do not plan on pursuing a Spanish major so this experience was entirely a passion project for me.\""

He did grade us a bit harshly but I don\u2019t care, I did not participate. The readings were super easy and the class is fun, although there were some criticisms. He had us read Madrid Sera la Tumba, which is basically a gay smut fanfic set in a revolutionary political Madrid. Like super confusing to understand. Also we went on a walking tour of an ethnic neighborhood that didn\u2019t sit right I have to say, we literally just walked around and stared at minorities. But Ruben is a millennial so like... Anyway he was great, I wished I couldve taken him to lunch. He was fun and really elevated my experience in Madrid, especially considering our fucking awful Art prof Fran kept trying to drag him down\""

We had Prof. Camila Perochena, a historian at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and she was a really good prof. A better title for this class would be \"History of Argentina\" because this class was, in fact, a course about the political, economic, and social history of Argentina. The first half of the class covered Argentine history from indigenous times to the early 1950s, while the second half covered Argentine history from the early 1950s to the present. The workload was pretty light: some reading that was kind of hard but that you didn't need to do all of, documentaries (which I'd recommend watching, especially because they provide good facts to put in the midterm essay), a midterm that consisted of a couple in-class essays, an individual presentation, a group presentation, and a final project. We were graded as such: participation (20 percent; important!), an announced quiz early in the term (5 percent), individual presentation on a current event / issue in Argentina (10 percent), group presentation (10 percent), in-class essay midterm (25 percent), and final project (30 percent). She's a really good lecturer and would post the slides on Canvas. Overall, I'd say it was a layup with some work involved, but I've probably learned more in Camila's class than in any other Spanish class I've taken at Dartmouth.\""

There were reading responses or individual presentations every other class. While this kept it interesting, it also encouraged participation, which is crucial in smaller class settings (our class was about 20 people, maybe fewer). Aguado really tries to engage you in discussion and you do end up benefitting from it. He can become a little frazzled in class, though I think that might have had something to do with the fact that he taught Spanish 37 during the hour before our class each day, which probably took a toll on his lecturing. Nevertheless, I feel like he makes it difficult not to do well if you pay attention in class, and he was organized enough to make the lectures focused and directed. Spanish Enlightenment, Romanticism, and Realism are definitely worth having a grip on in terms of peninsular and South American literature, and aren't so ancient that they're hard to relate to.

We also had to do 1 presentation on these writing assignments. I was not a fan of the syllabus change, because it seemed like the intention behind it was to motivate people to talk more in class. But people talked just as infrequently after his syllabus-swap so it was actually quite useless. I think that Aguado could have chosen more well-known works from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Her tests were kind of strange, in that we had to memorize dates, people, etc. about the history that surrounded the literature, but as a Spanish major I did think it was really important to know about these important figures that contributed to the literature.

The class was basically an Art History Intro course which wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the professor actually had something to say about art. I later discovered the prof wasn\u2019t even trained in art, he is an archaeologist specializing in Middle Aged architecture. WTF was he teaching this course for. Not only that, but he truly thought we were simple minded and constantly asked rhetorical questions and never sought responses. How are supposed to participate if you don\u2019t let us chime in??? A lot of Spaniard academics are very obnoxious, like that\u2019s expected from europeans, but we ARE Ivy League students and he gave little direction or opportunity for us to perform that. literally just the final (that was easy as hell btw) and a stupid research paper where we just had to recite facts?? Like how am I supposed to demonstrate to you any depth in skill that way, everyone ends up writing the same shit and ofc he has to grade us subjectively. I HATE THAT Europeans ALWAYS DO THAT, this happened on the French LSA too. GOD. Literally one prof told me they grade \u201cparticipation\u201d subjectively and complained about our consistent tardiness to class? which is valid but also we have class at 9:15 everyday and most of live 40 minutes away by public transport and we\u2019re dead tired from having dinner at fucking midnight and doing hours of tiring activities that sometimes not even the advisors want to do. And content wise, we all put up with 90 minute lecture because there was no homework but he ended up playing favorites at the end and it sucked. Like he also just was too obnoxious to take any criticism that his course was poorly structured. Spain has a LACK of depth when it comes to artists, like there was no reason we spent TWO weeks learning about ONE obscure renaissance artist. We spent so many classes learning nothing. Literally an entire class he talked about how Spain copied this style of mansion building from France or he covered what was happening in Italy or Germany, like THIS IS A SPANISH ART CLASS?? Refocus on Spanish Art that has seminal value?? We didn\u2019t even cover Modernism thoroughly, literally two days in the final class. we SKIMMED Picasso, Dali, Miro, Gaudi in TWO days!! WTH Fran. And Jose Del Pino our advisor was a fucking European snob too and didn\u2019t communicate any of criticisms. Spaniards really suck at being self aware and open to constructive criticism. Like he kept telling us \u201c oh well we gave you time to travel, we gave you the whole Friday, you only have to do the final, there\u2019s no homework, why re you comparing\u201d LIKE SIRRR, that would be fine if the tested material wasn\u2019t listed in its expected production, like if you ask for a red flower everyone is going to turn a red flower and when you have a policy of \u201cnot everyone can get an A\u201d like the HELL, how do you expect to differentiate off minute differences?? That just leads to subjective favoritism. I revised my friends essay we literally had the exact same information just worded differently and she participated WAY more than me and somehow she got a B and I get an A, like WTF. Jose del Pino didn\u2019t even come with. us to all the excursions because he \u201cgot tired and wanted to maximize his time in Spain with his kids\u201d?? you\u2019re literally our program LEAD and then he disregards our complaints as being whiny when he himself stopped coming to our fucking excursions because they were boring. And Im not even gonna start on the art museum visits where we he recited paragraphs from the textbook. My criticisms of the art class aren\u2019t even that rough, I come from a family of art professors, I KNOW what good lesson planning and especially ART lesson plans are supposed to be. But once again the snob showed itself and ruined the end of an otherwise chill, fun term. FUCK Fran Moreno and FUCK the European Spanish department!! except Leonor.. bc she was a Boss Bitch Baddie\""

Overall, it was really not a bad class, although it could be boring at times. Other parts of the FSP were incredible! Prof. Filip was very nice and, while she was pretty candid with us, she was not actually a very harsh grader and most students were very pleased with their final grades in the class. You don't need to do all of the reading, but try to spend some time on it before each class so that you can participate. Argentine art history is actually quite interesting and Buenos Aires has some incredible museums... this class, based on our schedule, just felt like a 10A without a break... it was tedious at times. Prof. Filip is very passionate, though, about the subject matter and our grade was determined by participation (20 percent), a glossary due Week 2 (20 percent), an oral presentation on a painting of our choice halfway through the course (30 percent), and a final paper of 7,000 characters or less and another presentation on a time period / source of our choice (30 percent). Overall, it had a light workload and was not a bad class: we learned a bit about art history, both as a a discipline and in relation to Argentina, and we got an art distrib out of it.\""

The titles and profs listed in the ORC are all messed up, so there is no point reviewing them all. The literature class is taught by a Dartmouth prof (Franconi in 2005) and the other 3 are taught by local profs. Classes are 2 hours each (4 hours of class each day, Mon-Thurs). Overall, the classes were pretty boring and not too helpful to my overall education. But that is not to discourage you from going on this FSP. Uruguay is amazing, you can travel lots, and the host families are the nicest. So even though the classes aren't the best, I'd HIGHLY recommend the FSP.\""

Workload was basically a reading for each class and discussion during the class. I think this means that our entire grade was based on our participation in class so if you get him definitely have some questions/comments prepared for each class. They can actually be about anything because typically he would open up the class by asking us what we did this weekend/week and then elaborating on some historical context for what we did or explaining some cultural trend. Then he would open up for any questions we had about anything else, and then once that was over we\u2019d talk about the reading. To be honest, I did not do them all. They were definitely the most difficult readings we got out of all 3 classes (avg 20ish pages of fairly dense writing), and I relied heavily on translation tools to get through some of them. They had some interesting topics though, so for me I used this class to practice discussing Argentine politics & history in Spanish and skimmed the readings just to give me some questions to ask / understand what we were going to be talking about in class. TLDR: this class was definitely an experience, but not in the common way. Chiller than chill. Participate for your grade.\""

That being said, I don't think we ever got through everything he had planned for a given class, which meant that he was constantly changing the syllabus and trying to play catch-up so that we could squeeze everything in. We ended up using over half of our x-hours throughout the term, and he still had to remove an entire unit from the class because we weren't going to be able to fit it in. He was also a painfully slow grader. There were 8 people in my class and we didn't get our midterm grades (from week 5) until week 8, and he also took about 4 weeks to grade our two (2!) page papers.

You will get an A if you form a good argument on your essay. She made the last test take home which really helped our grades, especially since not everyone did well on the first midterm. What made it difficult was that it was like relearning literary terms you learned in your English class in high school, only this time it's in Spanish and you only have a day or two to read a 20-page story where you are tempted to stop every minute to look a word up!

No assignments ever had rubrics and most grading seemed to be done on grammar rather than on the content of your work, but median grades were usually A- or A. If you have a good background in Spanish speaking and writing and at least skim every reading you should be fine but don't expect to improve your language skills from this course. Workload was not a lot, just a couple of hours for each project or essay and short readings before every class. Readings were surrealistic short stories or poetry so dense I couldn't even understand it in English, and most analysis was focused on basic concepts about stereotypes or discrimination so if you have basic thinking skills you can come up with easy responses to anything he asks in class.

He very much encourages students to be comfortable with making mistakes while speaking, which is great to see, but he doesn't do much else to make a classroom environment that's fun and engaging to participate in. Typically classes would be broken up into grammar components and discussion components, and he didn't seem particularly thrilled to be teaching grammar. To give you an idea of the classroom environment and his approach to it, he'd often ask us for \"un poco m\u00e1s de energ\u00eda\" (a little more energy) without doing anything to encourage that energy or engagement. He'd often tell us that if we didn't like a part of class we could do something else, without specifying what that \"something else\" would look like.

The class was a lot of work though. Besides the readings we had grammar exercises to do 2-3 times a week, which were gone over briefly in class. Then there were weekly 1-2 page papers (reactions to readings) that needed to be revised for the next week. There were also group presentations on aspects of Hispanic culture.

Problem is\u2026 SPAN 9 is basically entirely composed of speaking with in-class discussions and participation worth 40% of your grade. Every day you will have grammar homework and a reading or podcast to prepare for the next day\u2019s discussion on the topic. If you do all the work, it will take SO MUCH TIME, which is why I legit did 0 homework. I did not submit a single homework assignment past day 2 because they were not graded. Only in class discussions, quizzes, compositions, and the final project are graded. Thus, make sure you do very well on the quizzes, compositions, and final project. Then, try to speak every day in class at least once or twice! If you can, get on the good side of the prof because if Rosa likes you, I\u2019m assuming she will grade more favorably, hence why I got a good grade because I think she thought preferably of me.

Although Rosa was really nice in class, available out of class, and took a personal interest in the lives of her students, the grading did not seem to make sense. On the compositions (4) a point was taken off for every single grammatical mistake. By the 3rd one, I learned that if I wrote in the most simple spanish, I'd get a better grade than if I took risks and used more complicated phrasing and structure. This seems antithetical to an upper level course; all it taught me was to edit my papers 7 times before passing them in. The tests have nothing to do with anything you learn in class (they're take home and easy) and the homework is never corrected, collected, or talked about so there's absolutely no point in doing it. The other thing that really irked me was that we did barely any oral work- there was a presentation for which we could read off a paper and sometimes we talked about our weekend plans but other than that I felt like my speaking ability declined. I took this course having returned from the LSA and found it to be a huge let down and cause of the deterioration of my spanish. It might be just the curriculum though so Rosa isn't terrible to take it with.\"",

The professor grades the compositions and grabaciones very harshly as well. This class made me dread speaking Spanish even though I loved it in high school.

A final project was expected, which initially seemed to be a lot fo work though it was not overly strenuous in the end. A few voice recordings and videos were also assigned. However, significant ungraded work was assigned, which resulted in a heavy workload that did not really show tangible results, per se. In fact, sometimes the work was heavy and more than I previously expected. However, this work was vital to improving your language skills, and I feel that one could not truly succeed in the class without doing it. The organization was flawed at times. Occurring a few times, we as students were not precisely aware of an assignment's due date or the true objective of the assignment. Last second announcements to Canvas signaling a change were not too infrequent. Also, I feel as if the focus on grammar was often lacking. Thus, the organization of this class has room for improvement. As I previously detailed with the professor's Canvas announcements, this could be rattling and frustrating. Also, making students redo a paper for following instructions on the syllabus rather than Canvas was questionable.

The class does teach you a lot of interesting things about art and architecture in Spain, but is too slow-paced for the people that would like to learn about it, and is too much art history for the people that don't. But overall, almost everyone in my LSA loved Basilio. Whether you like him or not, though, he definitely makes the experience memorable.\""

Here are the tenses we learned: present,preterit,imperfect,future,conditional,subjunctive, past/perfect tenses, pluscaumperfect, and maybe I'm missing one but if you are familiar with these then skip Spanish 1-2 and go right into 3.

If I hadn't taken a lot of spanish in HS I imagine I would have been in a bit of trouble with this class grade-wise.

She'd get confused on what to do numerous times when the class would ask her grammatical questions and even frustrated if a student who genuinely had trouble understanding a topic would ask a question. Like another review said, she's pretty strict and definitely a hard-ass. Not being good with technology doesn't help her case either, especially if she needs to regrade VHL or make changes to a test.

The homework was just a bunch of VHL assignments, which were pretty chill and consistent. While the homework doesn't take that long, this class is still a pretty big time commitment because it met four times a week plus drill three times a week. So keep that in mind. My biggest piece of advice would be to use the website conjuguemos to learn and practice all of the subjunctive tenses before the term begins.

            "review 3: \"22F with Maria De Greiff: Maria C. De Greiff is 100% the easiest Spanish prof. Out of all the Spanish sections, I can say with confidence that Professor De Grieff assigns the least VHL homework and has the easiest speaking assignment (a group presentation on a Latin American musical artist, in which each person only has to speak for two minutes each.) In class, all Professor De Grieff does are relatively easy VHL assignments. Granted, she does go through a TON of VHL assignments each day (like ~8 in a 55 minute class) and cold calls students. But you can either just BS it or, if you're really worried about participation, do the VHL assignments in advance. (She releases the class agenda a week in advance, so you can look ahead.) There are also some days where she will just put on a TV show or play a board game for most of the class. I completely believe that you can go up to Professor De Grieff in the middle of an assignment and she will do a lot of it for you (which other reviews for her have said), although personally I never felt a need to do so. Drill still sucks, but that doesn't have much to do with the prof; just hope you get a chill drill instructor (luckily, I finally did this term.) I think the department intended to make the final harder by having more write-in responses, but I think in some ways it made the exam easier --- you can come up with what you want to say, rather than trying to interpret the VHL assignment text. I would take Spanish with Maria C. De Grieff at almost any cost --- the one exception being if you really don't want to deal with a 9S (which does really suck a lot, though.)\"",

I think i improved my listening a lot from this course. There is no homework except handing in review books to your drill instructors. There are a few short compositions and you have to study for a few essays. You are supposed to follow along in the book and study the lessons and vocab before going into every class, but that's usually doesn't take much time, and nothing happens if you don't study before every class. There is one stupid assignment where you have to go on some web page , read some story in spanish, and submit answers to questions view the web. the whole exercise (called \"Borges y Yo\") is pointless. The spanish department makes all spanish2 profs assign this so that it can claim it invokes technology and innovative teaching techniques. Professor Pushee's tests aren't that hard, but for some reason she does not grade on a scale or curve, and she does not round grades up - even from .5. For example, to get an A, you have to have an average of over 95 percent - no matter if nobody in the class gets an A or if everybody in the class gets an A. in reality, hardly anybody gets one b/c of this.

I have no doubt that most of these problems wouldn't be as bad if we were in person. My classmates and I had a hard time getting a hold of him when there were issues with quiz grading (auto-grading through VHL), when quizzes wouldn't start on time, when he wouldn't show up at the beginning of Zoom class, homework popping up on VHL randomly the evening before it's due without us being told, VHL homework that he said would be assigned never getting assigned, etc. As of writing this review, several of my classmates and I still have a quiz grade error in the gradebook that he's been promising he'd fix for weeks. Given, he had an internet outage at his home during the last week of the term, which is no fun I imagine, but he proceeded to change the dates for the oral final and written final several times in ways that were very frustrating to my classmates and I who had travel plans and work plans. Basically, it would be extremely rare to go 48 hours without rolling my eyes at something related to Prof Carranza and technology.

She takes the course VERY seriously (mainly because she always gets crap from her department) and wants everyone to speak in Spanish.

Don't talk in English after the 4th or 5th week or she will send you a blitz letting you know how disappointed she is in you.

Myrna Velez is an exceptional person and an experienced educator, and has a passion for her job that you could rarely see nowadays. It's indicative that this was a morning class, but after 10 minutes or so everyone was awake and ready to participate. Velez would make you feel really good if you do well - even if you've simply constructed the right sentence during class discussion.

As a whole, the class is a lot of work and it's not very smart to combine it with other time-taking or heavy reading classes (unless you're sort of a genius, as were some of the people in my class).

Most of the material the class covers is directly out of the book, so classes can be a bit dull. Given that they are only 50 minutes, this isn't really a problem. Early in the course, Moody spoke in english most of the time to explain grammar and give definitions. This helped make it easier to follow what was happening for students who didnt have much experience with spanish. The problem was, he kept talking in english a lot even late in the term. I think this will make the transition to spanish 2 more difficult because I am not used to hearing grammar and sentence structure described in spanish.

It was sort of an ongoing joke in our class that he only knew how to say \"vamos empezar!\" and \"entonces!\" Most of the time he teaches in English, and when you ask him questions, he tends to have to stop to think about them for a while before answering. Sometimes he can't even think of an answer, and will tell you that he'll \"look into it.\" Overall, Moody is really nice. He's funny, and enjoys having fun in class. If you really want TO LEARN a lot of Spanish, he might not be the right prof. You might want someone who's a little stricter and who will push you harder, but if you're looking for an easy laid-back class, he's the prof for you!\"",

Professor Moody is a great guy: very friendly, extremely accessible, and has a good knowledge of Spanish grammar. Office hours were very helpful! One drawback to him, however, is that he is not a native speaker and simply \"picked up\" the language while living in Spain. So I would not classify him as being an expert or the most knowledgeable person on Spanish (incidentally he is a Dartmouth English professor too).

The material was rarely explained in class, but was never really difficult to understand. Alba was definitely excited about teaching, and she usually did a fairly good job, but I think that she will get better as she teaches more. Tests were pretty ambiguous and confusing. The best advice I have is to write long responses. The tests say minimum of ten words, but we didn't find out for a while that minimum didn't mean lowest for an A, but rather lowest acceptable answer. Getting a good grade is kind of tough because there is no curve and an A is a 95%. But there is a large participation grade, which is helpful. Drill is very helpful, and can be fun if you have a good drill instructor. All in all, it was alright, don't try to switch into it, but don't be afraid if you're stuck with it.\"",
            "review 4: \"08F with Alba Sanchis: Alba this term was a new Prof, and so nobody knew what to expect in her class. There were def. mixed feelings about the way she taught. I was a big fan of Alba. She comes off as super serious at the begining, but loosens up. Know that after the first week, she speaks and expects only Spanish in class. Its scary at first, but you get used to it, and it helps you adjust to the language. Alba is very friendly, quirky and entertaining in class. Perhaps it is because she is so young, but in class conversations were pretty relaxed. TALK as much as possible no matter how bad your Spanish is, because she doesn't care. Participation is a huge part of your grade, and she MARKS DOWN how much you talk. Get on her good side and speak mucho espanol. She is very approachable. My complaint is that the lecture material is relatively random. I wouldn't even consider them lectures. Expect to stand up a lot and do a lot of peer to peer interactions and talking/questions. Its pretty fun, but doesn't really help you understand the material. There are a lot of games and skits as well. It is a very interactive class, so you won't fall asleep. We covered about 1/2 chapters every 2 weeks with tests every. It is true that there are few formal lectures on things like grammar. Expect a lot of self study from the book. The class is easy if you have taken Spanish in high school, but I can see why it can be difficult for a total novice. There is a lot of busy work, and even more for people new to spanish. Material is fairly rapid paced. Grade wise, it is hard to get a straight A because the bar is set so high at a 95, uncurved tests, easy to get anything below that if you put the time into it. The one thing that stood out in this class was her tests. Many times the material didn't correlate with the lectures. Vocab wasn't really straight up tested but you needed it to understand questions/paragraphs. Some questions can be tricky because of the complexity of the sentences used (more then we learned in class), and sometimes tenses etc never taught (past test on the first test?). Also on long answers WRITE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE and abuse the commas. She is all about pushing the spanish boundaries writing wise. As bad as the tests are, Alba seems to be a forgiving/lenient and fair grader. Nevertheless, expect ambiguous grading. Apparently some mistakes count more then others. Overall not a bad class, esp. as a freshman. If you had spanish in HS you will do fine, expect lots of work if you are totally new. Talk a lot with Alba/ In class. Alba is great makes the class entertaining. I wouldn't suggest switching in, but get ready for some memorable class bonding if you get placed in!\""

Also for basically any Spanish class, it assumes you know some Spanish already and it moves REALLY FAST.

Also, DO THE HOMEWORK. It is so easy to look up the answers of VHL (the online textbook homework for each night) online but I promise it makes things SO much harder later on.

Her VHL doesn\u2019t require accent marks (apparently some other teachers do) and she gives the speaking assignment in advance so you can prepare (apparently some other teachers give the prompt the day of, which I imagine is brutal.)
