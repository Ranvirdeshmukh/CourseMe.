Additionally, since this was the first time the class was ever taught, Prof Convertini would assign 500 word blog posts or discussion leading assignments on top of the regular work. She also shifted around the amount of weight each assignment was worth and changed some things in the syllabus around which was not necessarily bad. However, the workload during the weekend of the take-home midterm was brutal because she assigned discussion-leading, a Canvas post, and a regular amount of reading. The one good thing about this class was that there was no final exam, just a final project that you present during Week 9 and a 3-paged single spaced final essay reflecting on your experience in the course.

The workload is quite extensive but for someone with a background in another Romance language, it is not difficult at all. I found that Italian sounds like Spanish and shares many similarities with Spanish; it does also have a strong overlap with certain parts of French grammar. Drill\u2014which for our class was held at either 2:30 or 5:30\u2014seemed daunting at first but once you get an idea of how it works and pay attention, it will lose a lot of that previously held fear. Events were a meaningful part of the class. There were events hosted by the Italian Department very often and we were **strongly encouraged** to attend. They had one where you made bruschetta! Just go to class ready to engage and participate; get your work done ASAP; go to drill and try your best; and practice vocab, speaking, and writing. If you do all that, you'll be in good shape for the exams and quizzes and the final assignments; getting an A with very good effort put into the course is very doable.

            "review 1: \"23W with Giorgio Alberti: This is a super fun class, especially since Italian classes tend to be pretty small so everyone in mine got close. Giorgio is super energetic and funny. Lots of busy work but the repetition helps with learning. There was one week towards the middle when we had a bunch of assignments all at once but otherwise the workload was manageable. Also if you are overwhelmed and need an extension on something he will more than likely grant it. Participation and engagement is super big for this class--the final is a conversation with him and a series of reflections. The grading scale much more represents that of a high school class (different types of assignments, participation, etc.) than a college one. You are also required to go to 3 of the Italian department's events during the term but they are very relaxed and were honestly enjoyable. An A is a 94 but if you put in the work it's more than achievable.\"",

If you want to fulfill your language requirement and not have it be a super challenging or time-consuming course, Italian 1 is the way to go. To get an A, you basically just have to do the daily assignments (maybe an hour each, if that) and you've got it. Tests are pretty easy and don't count for much of the grade, and you have to do a couple longer compositions which are also not a big part of the grade. Even with it being very easy, I learned a TON of Italian in this class. I highly recommend this class.\"",

This class definitely did not disappoint. Professor Zoller is very kind and personable. His passion for teaching is palpable, and he makes the class engaging and fun. I would recommend studying the vocabulary a lot, as my class period often did not do this and he got a little peeved at us. Besides that, the coursework is not difficult at all. It's an introductory course, so he does not expect you to be perfect. Just speak in class and practice!\"",

It\u2019s not a very to pick up. Professor Zoller, is one of the nicest profs you\u2019ll have. Italian only has drill twice a week. You learn about Italian culture, food, art, etc\u2026 all super interesting. There\u2019s also a lot of great outside of class opportunities like pasta making, dance, (trip to Eataly Boston).
