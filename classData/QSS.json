Small group discussion was a focal point of this class, so you'll likely end up making a lot of friends since a lot of the discourse revolves around our personal experiences.

The basic work requirements this term (and they may change this) were 5 psets, with the lowest grade dropped, semi-optional Datacamp practices for completion grade (or just weighting your problem sets more if you didn't want to do these), and a final group project (paper and presentation). The course at the moment is almost exclusively taught in python, though they were debating switching to R to better align with the other QSS classes for future terms. There was a huge range of experience found in the class, so that got a little bit overwhelming at times-- there were people like me who had only taken CS1 and GOVT10, but also people who were CS majors with *far* more coding experience. However, (especially after the other problem sets were shortened and simplified after the first one), I did find that it was doable without any other computing background (so long as you do not skip the datacamp modules.) The class is somewhat top-down in concept approaches, however (which is part of the reason why it is possible for someone without much coding experience to do well)-- for example, we learned about some machine learning methods we could use on the data, but we didn't really go over the actual way that the methods work on the data in much detail. This class is therefore very practical, as I feel much more confident using the command line, github, and python, but there is a general sense that I don't really know *how* everything works, just that I know what I need to do to get it to work on the data at hand. I'm minoring in QSS so I had to take it, and if you want a crash-course in coding with data and using the tools (github, latex, etc) that everyone else seems to already know how to use, take this class, but if that doesn't apply to you, maybe wait on taking this one until they have a slightly more consistent schedule.\"",

In addition, a small percentage of the grade was participation and DataCamp modules (self-guided lectures graded on completion). Professor Johnson was incredibly understanding of student issues, and she works really hard to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to earn a good grade.

I think next year (23/24) it is being taught by another new professor but a different one this time.

Class lectures are hard to follow because we all end up working at our own pace, so I think this class would have been better either exclusively flipped or just lectures (and not working through practice problems in class individually).

Used about half of our X-hours which was rough for a 9L.

Herron is great and Hanlon is ok (although he has a ton of availability in office hours) but I would recommend only taking this course if you're genuinely interested in the material. There are definitely better QSS methods courses out there but you do learn about some good skills and contemporary areas of sports research in the class.\""

Honestly was a waste of time to have gone to class in the first place since he doesn't teach us anything. Apparently we are graded on participation in class and on slack but I have no idea how that is factored into our grade. Weekly psets were challenging but very doable. Last three weeks of the term get a bit hectic since we have a weekly pset and a weekly project but still very doable. Final exam was a 48 hour coding exam in which we were given visualizations and the data associated with them and had to recreate the visualizations. Exam was very tough but still doable. Overall, I think the assignments we were given were fair. I definitely learned a lot from this class and it solidified my interest in the qss major, but again, most of my learning was done by myself and by doing the weekly psets.\"",

Cooper literally puts \"Google is your friend\" in the directions for every assignment and I honestly have no idea how a (good) teacher could possibly ever do that. I seriously think there's a much better way of going about teaching the material than throwing us into the deep end without explaining anything but the bare basics and expecting us to figure out something very complicated on our own. Take only if you're a QSS major, but brace yourself. Definitely find other people in the class to work with, as well.\"",

I asked way too many questions over email and in class and he was always helpful. I thought this was the most satisfying class I've taken in the QSS major sequence so far and you walk away with a lot of capabilities in R. Fun creative/artistic component too and you get to make your projects about literally anything you want.\"",

However, in person this class was pretty solid. You still have to do a lot of googling especially for the projects (3 during the last 4 weeks or so), but Cooper held actual lectures and taught the important material (no datacamp) so you could do the weekly p-sets pretty much only with the class material. Cooper also always made a helper R script which was super helpful. I do think that it would be very helpful to have some coding experience coming into this class (CS1 level). The class was pretty small with only about 8 people showing up to lectures so there was ample time to work on problems individually with Cooper. He was always super helpful and tried his best to figure out a solution and make you understand what the problem was. If there were 20-30 kids in the class like in the other two sections, that might be a little more difficult. Lastly, while the Horuchi sections had two midterms and a final, all of which were timed and pretty difficult as I have heard, we only had one 3-day take home final (which was definitely difficult but I prefer it a lot over a timed coding exam).\"",

Try and get a handle on the projects at the beginning of the weeks, so you have ample time to work through issues you may encounter. What I will say, is though I taught myself 90% of the material, the professor is pretty understanding if things come up and you communicate with him ahead of time. Be timely with your communications, but be prepared for this to be your primary workload class for a term. That all being said, it is the most employable class I have taken at Dartmouth and I actually felt like I left knowing how to visualize data in R (but what you reap from the course will be directly determined by how much you put into it, as with anything). If you have little to no experience with programming, definitely take this as your hardest class of a term.\"",

The 2 hour lectures mainly covered what the video covered so I didn't really get much out of it. Grading is very slow for this class; at the end of the term, only up to week 6 homework was graded which was done by the TA. Cooper absolutely does no grading at all; we never got grades back for our labs or projects or for the final exam. This was a bit stressful at times since you absolutely have no idea what grade you have in the class. As for the teaching, I would highly recommend to have some type of coding experience- I cannot stress this enough. Even though this is an intro to coding class, Cooper breezes through lots of concepts, including ones that were needed on the weekly homework. What is strange is that Cooper expected you to Google if you didn't know what something meant, which I ended up doing an excessive amount. Overall, I thought the class had a lot of potential but the structure was highly disorganized; Cooper is an excessive talker and often times goes WAY OVERBOARD than he needs to. Take it if you have to but wouldn't recommend if you want to learn about R- just look off videos online.\"",

Yeah he didn't hold online class and expected us to borderline teach ourselves, but if you went to his office hours that he held twice a week he would help you go through your code and show you how he did his for reference. Very few people were in the office hours and he did it in a group style where you could hear other people's questions so even if you did not have a specific question you could hear what other people were working on. I also sent him some questions about assignments and he usually got back to me in some sort of timely fashion. I thought R was a cool language and you can make some really interesting graphics if you put in the time in. I guess I never knew what my grade was in the class but it was P/F so I think Cooper did not really care to be so on top of grading.

I heard bad things about Cooper going into the class, but I figured I could take it as a 4th class with the online situation, and it wouldn't matter that much. No actual teaching took place. Everything came from a subscription to DataCamp, which I did initially but eventually gave up on by the end of the term. He said that he would make YouTube videos to supplement the DataCamp material, but over the course of the term, he made *maybe* two hours of videos, and even those would happen ages after he said they would. Nothing I submitted was graded until after the midterm and there was no info given on what would be considered a pass in the class. He never responded to a number of emails I sent, and the link to office hours was never posted on the canvas. To top it off, he released the final late \ud83d\ude43.

Cooper is so incompetent that several times he asked us to do problems that we did not learn how to do in the week's lectures. Each time, I would scour Stack Overflow for solutions, and then come the next week I would realize that the problem he had asked of us the week before was covered in the following week's lecture. So he's so terrible that he can't even keep a syllabus that's in sync with the material being taught. He also ignored several emails throughout the term asking basic questions such as \"when will you grade my assignments?\" and \"why are you giving problems that we haven't learned how to solve?\" I never actually got a single grade during the term. I honestly have no clue of the quality of my work because I got no feedback other than that I passed the class.

With all that being said he is genuinely the sweetest person ever and is incredibly useful if you meet with him out of class. He wants people to do well.

It's a flipped classroom, so basically we had to teach ourselves the entire material. The homework wasn't even prerecorded lectures, it was just chapters from a free online textbook, which was pretty dry. In class, we would just work on precepts. There were three exams (including the final) that were 20% each, three projects that were 10% each, 7% participation (which was based on ed discussion participation), and 3% for a contest where we submitted one of our projects and got to score each other's data visualizations. Also since the class is cross-listed with gov there's an enforced B+ median which imo is stupid - if we're paying thousands of dollars to take this course, just to have to teach it to ourselves, I feel like the least they can do is give us an A in return lol. We haven't gotten grades back but I'm not expecting to have done super well - but that being said, I feel this is the most I've learnt in a Dartmouth course (even if I did have to teach it to myself). Ultimately, I view this class as sort of a necessary evil, and even if it might hurt your gpa I think it's good to take, especially if you're an econ/gov/cs major, or really any field that might encounter data. I would also recommend having some coding experience before taking the course!\"",
            "review 3: \"23S with Yusaku Horiuchi: This course is the best course I've taken in my first year at Dartmouth. It teaches you so much about data wrangling and visualization, specifically making professional graphs and figures which are skills that are so applicable to basically any job you can think of. The course is very hard and you get what you put into it. The flipped classroom style is not horrible if you can learn based on an answer key and the prof explaining his answers. Horiuchi is super knowledgeable and an amazing prof and person. Go get lunch with him! He wants to get to know his students and see them succeed. He meets with you over Zoom or in person during office hours and is super active on ED Discussion to help answer any questions you may have. CLASS STRUCTURE: Flipped - meaning you do precepts (a lesson with problems) in class with the guidance of the prof, but the prof does not teach. He will gradually show the answers in class and explain the solution. You can follow along and review all homework and class work outside of class. The first midterm was very different from the second midterm and Final. I think I can safely say that everyone liked the format of the second midterm and final WAY MORE than the first midterm because essentially you just data wrangle and make 2 figures. The projects were great in testing what we knew, preparing for the exams, and making a product we were proud of. The DV contest is also a great way to practice good visualizations. Overall, the class had great methods of evaluation. I have learned so much that I know I will use in the future. I love QSS even more because of it, and I know this class will be insanely useful in the future. I recommend EVERYONE, even non-QSS majors take this class, especially with Horiuchi.\"",

Those are the only two good things I can say about this class. There is very little actual instruction since it's a flipped classroom model, but in my opinion there's so much going on that there should at least be some lecture component. The actual class period was used to complete a precept, with homework being assigned reading about the material. I would say that I would have to redo the precepts (which take at least an hour to complete) at least twice outside of class before I really understood what was going on, so that combined with the assigned reading added up to a lot of time spent on this course. I personally did not enjoy it and it caused me a lot of unnecessary stress, but I don't regret taking it because the material was genuinely useful. If you're a GOVT major who needs a TAS/TLA credit, I would recommend this class just because you get credit for both. And if you end up needing to take it and coding is not your strong suit, I recommend being super proactive in the first half of the course, making a huge effort to understand the smaller concepts (the material only gets harder), going to office hours/signing up for peer tutoring, etc. It will make the second half of the class, which has most of the projects and exams, so much easier.\"",

The professor made it clear day 1 that this was a flipped course, but I wouldn\u2019t call it that: there were no lectures at all. In my previous experience, a flipped course here at Dartmouth means prerecorded lectures and work/questions in class; this was simply reading the textbook \u2013 an expectation of all courses \u2013 and working on optional assignments in class where you could occasionally ask the professor a question I could have more quickly found the answer to online (a much more realistic expectation of programmers, in my opinion, and far more realistic than having 2 hours to analyze so much inconsistent bad data like our exams are structured). The professor put a lot of effort into writing the assignments, yes, but I feel his effort would have been much better used by explaining what code is important for us to use rather than asking students to read on their own and figure out homework as independently as possible. Overall, I loved the content I learned, but I would tell everyone I know to avoid this course at all costs.

My peers who had only a little coding experience (gov 10 or another 10-level course) really really struggled (not an exaggeration). I would not take this course if you haven't taken at least COSC 1. I personally have a lot of coding experience and I still found this course difficult. All of that said, I really recommend this course.

The three projects/labs really helped me understand the concepts but they were very time-consuming. I ended the class with an A with some Python background (CS1 and using Pandas at an internship) and a LOT of time and effort.

            "review 8: \"22F with Yusaku Horiuchi: This is a HARD class, but that doesn't mean you can't do well. Horiuchi teaches QSS17 as a flipped classroom, so you do textbook readings (which weren't that helpful imo) and then come to class to do \"precepts\" which are just coding exercises that go over the main concepts of the class. The class moves very fast, you pretty much do something new every class and you have to practice a lot on your own time (redo the precepts over and over again!) to get the hang of coding. The class is divvied by attendance, 2 midterms, 1 final, and 3 labs. For labs, you are graded in comparison to your peers, so basically your grade is determined by how many functions you use and if you use more than most of your peers you do better. You can also get extra credit for the last lab. The first midterm was tough but he changed the format of his exams for the second midterm and final, and I felt like they were much more reasonable. Horiuchi is always accessible during office hours if you do have questions. This class is tough but also extremely useful.\"",
            "review 9: \"21S with Yusaku Horiuchi: Take this course with Yusaku Horiuchi!!! Yes, this course is flipped, and that's clear from day one. So if you take this course and then you complain about how \"we just did problems in class\" you literally fucked yourself in the ass son. But, I disagree with what others said; the prof definitely matters. Horiuchi put A TON of effort into creating detailed problem sets (\"precepts\") for us to work on, so thankfully we weren't just watching Datacamp lectures like I originally feared. The problem sets were also incredibly socially relevant--Horiuchi incorporated recent data on issues like COVID, hate crimes, mass shootings and income inequality. He's also incredibly nice. The man answered seemingly every single piazza question within 15 minutes (he could've done it in 5, but he wanted to give us a chance). He also dumbed down our final A LOT to reduce our workload. Another review almost make it sound like he didn't do much at all, when it's the exact opposite--he probably put in more effort than 90% of all my profs at Dartmouth. You just need to invest time and effort to take advantage of the good resources he offers. And yes, as others have said, this course isn't easy. Even with my previous coding experience, the learning curve in the beginning weeks was pretty big. If you take this class without previous coding experience, I'd say bust your ass all of weeks 1-4 to catch up. There was also a particularly hellish period of 6 days where 50% of our entire grade was decided (Lab project, midterm 2, final). Grade-wise, this class isn't the most forgiving; the class median is curved to a B+. Again, this was clear from day one, so to all the people who kept bitching about their grades, you literally fucked yourself in the ass son. So, definitely don't take this class if you can't remotely handle 1. a flipped course structure, and 2. a likely B+. But regardless, I highly, highly recommend taking this course with Horiuchi.

The material covered is really interesting, and you learn a ton of useful skills, but the amount of concepts to learn can get overwhelming at times. Horiuchi is...okay. He's absolutely a very nice person, but our class sessions consisted of sitting in a breakout room in near-silence, working on the exercises. He would pop in from time to time to see if we had any questions, but wouldn't stay for very long. This class is very much self-driven, so if you can hold yourself accountable for keeping up with and reviewing the material, you'll be fine. Tests were fair, but often a time-crunch, and he can be picky on grading. Would recommend this course mostly for the content, not for the prof.\"",
            "review 11: \"21S with Yusaku Horiuchi: I feel like I learned so much in this class and that I could confidently use R in a job or research project. However, this is not a layup or a class for someone with no coding experience. The learning is self-driven, since Horiuchi does not lecture, instead he assigns textbook readings and practice exercises that you complete during class. Horiuchi's tests are difficult -- he warned us that he has given a midterm with a 40 median before. There were two midterms, a final at the start of week 9, and three diy data visualization projects. Horiuchi is nice and approachable, but you have to actively seek help if you think you are falling behind on some of the units or projects. Overall, I am really happy to have learned how to use R, but this class can be stressful.\"",
            "review 12: \"19X with Yusaku Horiuchi: This class teaches the coding language R. I don't recommend it to people who have zero coding experience, as many of your classmates will have former experiences in R from research and other classes. A student who has coded in R for several years will be evaluated equally as a student who is learning R for the first time. The class carries a flipped structure, meaning you will watch the teaching videos as homework (Horiuchi does not directly teach, rather a textbook lecturer unaffiliated with the college teaches you in these pre-recorded videos), and then you spend the entire class doing problem sets. I took this class because Horiuchi does an excellent job marketing it, claiming that it doesn't matter whether you have former coding experience or not. Having taken this class now, I disagree with that statement. This can be a very stressful class for those not yet comfortable with learning how to code. It made my sophomore summer miserable, and I felt helpless when I couldn't figure things out.\""

            "review 5: \"07F with Joel Levine: This class is structured differently from others. An assignment is due at the beginning of nearly every class. There are no midterms, and instead of a final exam you write a final paper. Here's the catch: if you don't show up to class, you don't learn the lesson. If you don't learn the lesson, you don't understand the assignment. If you don't understand the assignment, the homework that is otherwise pretty straightforward becomes mildly hellish. To summarize: show up and it's a fair, easy, and even fun course. The prof is one of the nicest guys here. he will read every word you write for him and give you constructive feedback. It's nice to know that your work will actually be read and appreciated by someone. I'd say the final paper is actually the most interesting part of the course. You are given the option of either applying the tools you've learned to a data set (it IS intro to data analysis) or you can try to learn a new statistical technique on your own. I'd definitely opt for learning a new technique. It is amazingly gratifying when you all the sudden understand this technique you'd never even heard of before. I had never really had an independent learning experience like this before and now just wish I had more time to establish a more in-depth understanding of my topic. Your technique kind of becomes your 'baby', so to speak. Take it! Enjoy! But KEEP UP!!\"",

This year was much better. He gave like 14 assignments which took me personally around 1-2 hours each but sometimes they could be finished in more or less time. I recommend finishing them as fast as possible. His Office Hours were from 10-11:30 which isn't that much time but as long as you go to him with a semi-finished assignment, he'll help you out to get a 5/5. He was pretty good at answering emails as long as you send them before 5:00pm. He does love to talk about his life especially in Tanzania which is interesting. The first exam wasn't so bad but the final was way harder than I thought. There were more technical questions like when to use a \"t-test\" or \"two sample tests.\" I recommend doing lots of practice problems with those to really digest how they work. The final project was quite a lot of work so definitely get started early. All in all, the class wasn't bad at all and definitely manageable. I recommend taking the class.\"",

I would highly recommend this class as it is a great gateway into QSS, and I think I'm going to major in QSS after taking this class.\"",

This man has a lot of stories to tell, and serves for an entertaining morning class. Professor Dewan was mostly around, except for a few occasions when we wasn't responsive/available to meet. He's really chill about attendance and doesn't care if you don't show up. That said, the structure of the class was mildly disappointing: the stats portion is heavy while the coding section is lacking. The first half of the course maintained a more even balance but the second half was mostly stats with little new coding which was slightly disappointed. The workload isn't awful for the majority of the term: every week there were two short p-sets which are pretty easy to do well on and some textbook readings. The midterm and final were difficult, but not impossible. The end of term is heavy with the accompanying of a large project and paper. Probably an easier class than most other 10's, so a good option if you don't want to go too in depth for your stats requirement. Don't take this class if you are looking to learn much about data visualization or computing methods, but if you want to learn about an interesting and undeniably smart guy as well as some lackluster statistics, go for it.\"",

Not really sure why he\u2019s teaching this course, but I still enjoyed it. He wasn\u2019t great at explaining things, I think because he is too smart to be teaching an intro class. If you take this class, I encourage you took look past DeWan\u2019s social awkwardness and talk to him, you\u2019ll hear some great stories. Our class was also really small which was nice and helped us get to know him. The weekly assignments were at times hard to complete based on what we did in class but he marked them super easily. We also didn\u2019t learn much R which is sort of the point of the class, and the final didn\u2019t have any coding. It\u2019s probably easier than most of the other 10s so I would recommend it.\"",

Professor Dewan taught at as if you were learning a 4th coding language. Also the pace the course moved at was insane. During the first eight weeks we barely learned anything, so, during the last two weeks Professor Dewan crammed 70 percent of the course load in. You learn very little in class as well, he is not a good lecturer at all. Our final exam was probably was the worst structured exam I have ever seen. He added a question he blatantly said in class he would not add and it was a giant scram for the whole class to finish the exam. Take any other stat course or just make sure Professor Dewan is not your teacher.\"",

The course is meant to involve intro level coding but Professor Dewan assumed we all had prior experience, then he scrapped coding altogether and made us do the entire course by hand which for most of the equations we were doing was simply criminal. There was no course structure and he taught us majority of the material in the couple weeks before our final exam. The final exam itself was a nightmare. It was 3 hours long and consisted of us having to write almost an entire small book within that time frame and I say that without sarcasm. Please do not take his class.\"",

He was not a very good lecturer though, so sometimes the problem sets were very confusing as we did not learn the proper coding in order to do the problem set. The final and midterm were medium difficulty, but you could get away with not knowing what you were doing as we get a 9x11 note sheet. I did not take much away from this, I did not learn the coding skills I was hoping, DeWan is a very boring and poor lecturer, and the material is not too interesting, but it is not too difficult or time-consuming of a class.\"",
