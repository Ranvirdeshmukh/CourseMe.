            "review 1: \"23W with Alexis Abramson: Very interesting class with a great prof! Abramson is the dean of thayer so she's super well-connected and stacked. She showed us her startup and her 100% energy efficient house, which was super cool. She also gets a guest speaker every year she runs this class - she got Bill Gates last year and Steven Chu (former secretary of energy and Nobel Prize winner) this year. We also had a tour of the CECS building, and got to see some really cool stuff. There was also a lot of discussion and ideation in the class, so if you're remotely interested in energy, startups, tech, policy, you should consider taking this seminar! She grades pretty leniently, and she did say at the start of the class that unless we made any major mistakes or showed very little effort/improvement that everyone in the class would likely get an A.\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with Alexis Abramson: This was a great seminar to take, the workload and reading was reasonable and the topic itself was interesting. The writing assignments were broad enough that you could bend them towards a sub topic that you were interested in, and energy sustainability is a very relevant topic in modern society, so worth learning more about. Prof Abramson (the Dean of Thayer) was very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, and provided interesting insights into group discussions. She is a very capable and nice professor and very approachable. My one complaint is the structure and weighting of the writing assignments, since the annotated bibliography of the final essay was worth the same as the final draft of the first major essay, and the way that the final essay assignments were structured meant that after a first draft was 2000 words and the final was 3000, which caused issues in my structure. Overall I think it\u2019s well worth taking this seminar, and it will give you a greater appreciation of our current situation when it comes to climate change and how we are dealing with it.\"",
            "review 3: \"23W with Alexis Abramson: I absolutely loved this course just because of the content given that it's a writing seminar. If you have any interest in climate change, energy, the environment, economics, policy related to any of those subjects, or engineering, you'll be able to get something out of this class. The class is heavily discussion based with at least 1 discussion every week after doing readings. We read \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster\" by Bill Gates which is a very informative and easy read. Every week we would read a few chapters of the book or outside articles and would have to do 2 discussion posts on canvas (1 of our own and 1 responding to a classmate). Discussion posts and participation in class discussions are graded! After doing the readings you would discuss in class with 2 people leading the discussion each week. If there was a writing assignment that week (small paragraphs, drafts, etc.) we would spend 1 of the days going over what we wrote and sharing it out. So basically 1 day of sharing and 1 day of discussions every week. I agree with the other review that the weight of the grading could be different, but overall as people have noted, you can likely get an A if you put in the work and participate. Most papers are very open in what topic you can pick but require a good amount of research. She also is very nitpicky about thesis and them being arguable, but she teaches you how to write them in class. Professor Abramson is very knowledgable but didn't lecture like at all. There were like 1-2 very short lectures the entire term. That being said, she is not as intimidating as she seems and is very friendly in class and office hours. Still very professional though. Take this class. You'll learn something from it and further your interest in combatting climate change for sure!\""

            "review 1: \"21W with Eric Hansen: So 21W was kind of a trail-and-error in remote teaching for this class. Due to other reasons, Prof. Bonfert-Taylor was unable to teach alongside Prof. Hansen as she was busy handling ENGS 20 for the term, but she did make a few of the concept videos that we watched for homework earlier in the term. Don't know if she will come back, but hopefully she will (though I must say Hansen handled it very well on his own). The remote format made the class transition to the following (using the G block, from 4-6pm EST on Mondays and Wednesdays): Lectures on Zoom during class time (which were recorded for those who were asynchronous), and non-mandatory lab sessions were held Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday for two hours at a time. Lab sessions were hosted by TA's and were used sort of like office hours, where you would essentially work on the lab and ask for help if/when needed. Labs for me personally took quite some time throughout most of the course (despite what some have said about the first few labs being easy), so I often just went to all 3 lab sessions and treated them as work time for the lab, and I would have them finished by the end of the last session most of the time (so roughly 6 hrs of work per lab, more on the later ones). Homework consisted of: 2 reading quizzes for textbook and misc. readings before each class (due a few hours before class), 6? (we only ended up having 4, even though the syllabus says 6) small (roughly 1 hr) quizzes spread throughout the term starting week 3, and the labs, which took the most time (as stated above). Labs gave extra credit for extra features so if you did them, they really do boost your grade. Hansen held a lot of office hours each week (at least 3-4 separate one-hour sessions) and was very accommodating of those in other time zones with his scheduling as well. The small class (20 people) really had a great time bonding together in labs with troubleshooting and I got to know a lot of my classmates well through that and our breakout rooms during lecture/class exercises. 10/10 would recommend this course, even if only to find out that embedded systems aren't for you after taking it (but even better if you find out that they are)! P.S. As of this term (21W), I believe the course number is changing to ENGS 28, and will count as one of the Distributive Core classes (24-28) for the ENGS Major/BE!

All of that was true. Classes were essentially optional office hours because the class itself was a flipped classroom. There were a few video lectures on Canvas, but besides that, you\u2019re on your own. Taylor does not lecture in class and does not explain concepts basically at all. I think Taylor is a very nice human being and pretty lenient at times with grading, but he is not a good professor. He expects you to know or at least figure out everything (including debugging) on your own. That being said, the actual project of building a Tiny Search Engine (TSE) is done in a group of 3 students. However, if your group is not on the same page or doesn\u2019t do work, you\u2019re basically stranded to do everything on your own or get a horrible grade. Each module is graded out of 10, which means 1 mistake and your grade drops to an A- or worse. Grading-wise ENGS 50 is MUCH HARDER than COSC 50, and I would pull multiple all-nighters to make sure I got an A in the class. If you\u2019re thinking about taking ENGS 50 because it\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d than COSC 50, that may be the case, if you\u2019re willing to do everything on your own. If you don\u2019t have the time to do everything on your own, don\u2019t even think about taking this course. COSC 50, while more time-consuming has so much more STRUCTURE, and thus is easier. Plus the grading for COSC 50 is out of 100 for labs and much easier to get an A. Overall, you\u2019re going to risk a lot of time and effort on this class, and it is A STRUGGLE. Best of luck.

Your experience may differ if you had a different professor for that course, however. The final project is very significant, but not quite as intense as Professor Odame's ENGS 32 final project. Otherwise, the workload is pretty unevenly distributed, with lecture weeks having almost no work and lab weeks sometimes getting overwhelming. The first and second labs in particular are quite tough for the amount of time you have to complete them. ENGS 28 is definitely not required to succeed in this course, although you do some coding in C, so make sure to brush up on your ENGS 20 knowledge ahead of time and maybe briefly look into how microcontrollers work.\""

Incredibly disorganized and unclear expectations. Grading is completely arbitrary and does not at all follow what is assigned. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!\"",
            "review 2: \"23S with Klaus Keller: LMFAO the other review made me die laughing. I had very mixed feelings... this was the opposite of what a FYS should have been. Klaus is super dope, he's very German (he recognizes the different expectations both cultures have socially), but I did not learn a single thing about writing. You're assigned like 17 billion readings throughout the term, which I stopped doing after week 1 and was fine. This was his first time teaching the course, and we gave him tons of feedback (you're welcome), so hopefully it'll be a lot better next time. The thing that made this class weird is that he graded, like, nothing. WE HAD TAs. FIRST YEAR SEMINARS SHOULD NOT HAVE TAs. Because he's a super qualified ENGS prof and not used to baby freshman, he wasn't really prepared to teach the style of a FYS. Because he didn't have an attendance policy, one kid stopped showing up after week 2 and did ALL the work asynchronously. Attendance should 100% be a part of every Writing 5 and FYS class (it almost always is) because the point of these freshman-only classes is a chance to cultivate a close relationship with a professor and other people in your class. The review paper is the main assignment, and he actually did structure the whole process well. Each week there's 1-2 assignments due, and they're all related to the paper (research 5 articles and write an annotated bibliography, write an abstract and outline, etc). This was useful. What wasn't useful were the TAs that AGAIN we should NOT HAVE HAD. Their feedback was low-key eh, and I think overall the number one thing I learned was how to write a 28 paged review paper in 48 hours. I don't mean to make it sound like you shouldn't take the course... I mean, if you're thinking about being an EARS or ENVS or ENGS major then it'd be fun (one of my majors is ENVS). We got some cool zoom speakers. And one day Klaus hosted a lunch for all of us as a feedback sessions and to talk about how the course was going. He takes no BS, and I think he's pretty cool, but I hope the class gets better the more he teaches it. Other than the paper, we had this assignment called the \"pitch,\" which was basically our paper but in speech form. We make a video and submit the script for it. It literally counted for as much towards our grade as the paper, but it was almost kinda nice because it was just our review paper outline basically. Eh. We all got As. I had to submit every assignment like 2 weeks late because I had pneumonia and though I got scolded for this (lol I didn't always email and ask for an extension, don't be like me) and I still got an A. Overall chaotic, wacky, but hey, if you like climate change, don't really want a humanities FYS (aka no learning how to write), and just want lectures on climate change, then this is the class for you! I'm glad it's over.\""

No word describes him more. Don't get me wrong, he is a really nice guy and knows the field like the back of his hand. HOWEVER, as a professor, he makes simple concepts significantly more complex than they need to be. He is notorious for the 2 question exam; and yes, none of them are mathematic. Rather they are conceptual, you answer in a paragraph and if it doesn't fit EXACTLY what he described in class, you will likely get no credit. The midterm median was a 50%.... Anyways, he uses every x-hour, in addition to a weekly problem set, 3 labs (with lab reports), a midterm, a final, and a final project. Class is wildly boring. I would love to have him as an advisor for a project I am interested if it is in a related field. As a professor, he is overly pedagogic. This is an exploration of how Sullivan sees and understands the energy world. Is this view likely more accurate, practical, and logical than what is used? Yes. Is it a goddamn pain in the ass that is overly complex, and hard to follow? Yes. Good luck, its just a boring grind. lol\""

The x-hours were just taught by the TAs where they tried to teach us how to use R, but it was very hard to follow and I did not really learn much from it (and it seems as though other students thought the same because the TA x-hours consistently had lower attendance than the regular lectures).

Our overall grades were probably curved at least 3 full percentage points because of how poorly the class did on exams. That just goes to show that this class is very challenging conceptually. I would recommend having a very strong math background if you want to aim for an A in this class. Regardless, I think Jayanti is the best prof to take it with, so do it if you can.

There are weekly projects graded on completion (complexity varies from 20-hour discrete math worksheet to 3-hour coding project), a midterm and a final, and an independent final project (code + 15-page report), which you can make as big or as small as you want to.

The use of libraries abstracted all of the hardware that we had to know, additionally the professor gave us the functions to use so it was more of an easter egg hunt, looking for the correct constants and definitions than it was coding.

The class looks at nonrenewable resources, biomass systems, simple populations, water networks, decision making, carbon sequestration, climate change, and everyone does project presentations on a resource of their choosing. My favorite topic was probably decision-making. It was so interesting to play with the decision trees and calculate the monetary benefits of any combination of choices.

            "review 12: \"09F with Benoit Roisin: The course: A rather long course synopsis from an ex- \u00e2\u20ac\u0153environmental\u00e2\u20ac\u009d engineer who switched to mechanical after taking Engs 37.. Engs 37 tries to be both an introductory course to non-majors, and a difficult gateway course meant to guide engineers who are considering the field. In this sense, the course finds itself in a double-bind of being too depressingly easy for those who are already familiar with the design parts of environmental engineering, renewable energy and the like, while some find the math part incredibly hard. If you already have some exposure to green tech, you likely won't learn anything new. I could bet that anybody interested in taking the course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but who hasn't taken it yet - could not only have passed the final, but done very well on it. All 10min in class quizzes, take-home midterm and take home final, all open notes/book, were depressingly easy. Grading is 30% homeworks, 20% in class quizzes, 25% take-home midterm and 25% take-home final. For the engineers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you'll get more points taken off for sign errors than conceptual errors. The grade distribution is determined more by the amount of silly errors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because the tests don't test any concepts. All the math-based problems were mirror-images of those on lecture slides, and the questions about broader green tech \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is the impact of x\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, etc. seemed like they had been pulled from a 3rd grade lesson plan. Some examples of questions that appeared that I felt were entirely pointless or inappropriate: On a quiz: How many settling basins does the Hanover wastewater treatment plan have? On a problem set: List five things in your dorm room and explain how they can be reused or recycled and how they could be designed to be reused or recycled. On the final: Give some examples of energy chains of the form source \u00e2\u2020\u2019 conversion technology \u00e2\u2020\u2019 intermediate form of energy \u00e2\u2020\u2019 useable form of energy. For example: wind \u00e2\u2020\u2019 wind turbine \u00e2\u2020\u2019 electricity \u00e2\u2020\u2019 electric motor \u00e2\u2020\u2019 mechanical motion. There are some things you'll \u00e2\u20ac\u0153learn\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. You'll learn what a scrubber is, how wastewater treatment works, and get to go on a tour of the facility. But I wouldn't waste a class on all that, unless you are looking for an easy A and a way to waste tuition dollars. Clapping for credit is more fun and less depressingly dumbed down. If you are interested in environmental engineering as a non-engineer, you won't learn much from this course. This course could just have easily been taught under environmental studies and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. There is no hands-on design work or actual problem-solving, engineer skills that I'm presuming you're looking to gain. If you are interested in environmental engineering as a hardcore engineer, I hate to break it to you, but being hardcore and an environmental engineer are mutually exclusive. Environmental Engineering has an identity crisis, in that it tries to have both depth and breadth. It is problem-based field, not a skill based field. Scrubbers, cyclones and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purifiers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you learn about in the first part of the course are really applied mechanical engineering problems. You call on a mechanical guy to build and install a windmill or solar panel, not an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153environmental\u00e2\u20ac\u009d engineer. Anaerobic digestion and the bacterial side of wastewater treatment is all biology or chemical engineering. In fact, the guy who runs the Hanover waste-water treatment plant had professional training as a biologist, not as an environmental engineer. Green design in buildings is a form of responsible civil engineering and architecture. If you want to take some environmental engineering classes, I'd highly encourage you to pick another more solidified engineering discipline, like electrical, mechanical, chemical etc. to be your main focus and then spice it up a bit with the environmental classes. And look outside the engs department to do so. The environmental studies department will give you a much wider idea of where you can apply your engineering skills. The prof Some say Benoit can be a great professor. But it definitely doesn't come across in this class. He teaches from power points which he reads from verbatim. You could skip class the entire term and still take away more from the posted lecture slides than by going to class (because at least you won't fall asleep). It's ironic because Benoit is very self-conscious about how people think of him as a prof. Don't expect to get inspired or challenged from Benoit, at least not in Engs37. That said, he does give great advice though for those interested in the field, so definitely get to know him even if you choose not to take Engs 37 with him.\"",
            "review 13: \"09F with Benoit Roisin: Summary: Course: A- Professor: A Disclaimer: I am not an engineering major, and this is the only engineering class I have taken or will take at Dartmouth. My review comes from the perspective of someone who has focused on environmental economics. ENGS 37 is a superb introduction for any non-majors want to get an engineering perspective on environmental issues. Benoit is a lovable, funny, and intelligent guy who really loves what he does and is eager to share it with his students. The first half of the course is mostly quantitative, but Benoit and the TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are available to help anyone lacking a science background. I made it through just fine having not taken chemistry or physics since high school four years ago. (Note: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfy the prerequisites for the course, talk to Benoit. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any of them, and he was still fine letting me take the course. You really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need them anyway.) The second half of the course is more qualitative and theoretical, and the material gets noticeably easier around the halfway point. Overall, this is a must-take course if you plan on going into any field related to the environment. It gives you a great sense of the challenges and opportunities posed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s issues, but it does so from a realistic technical perspective. The Professor Benoit is a hilarious environmental engineer who grew up in Belgium, but he knows America and American politics just as well as the next guy. He clearly enjoys what he does, and it shows in every lecture. My one complaint is that he can occasionally get a bit boring and/or caught up in the details, but this is a minor problem that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surface very often. He has a good sense of how engineering fits into the broader social and political context, though I do wish he would have offered more of an economics perspective. He is very available to answer questions outside of class, and he helps his students with personal engagement and sincerity that is rare among professors. Overall, a genuinely nice guy you will come to love. The Course ENGS 37 begins by going over the basics of how materials behave in the environment: a primer on chemistry, volumetric flow rates, and how substances change in concentration as they move through water or air. Then it applies these principals to a few specific technologies, including dust cyclones, settling tanks, electrostatic precipitators, and more. The second half of the course moves into more qualitative ideas, like risk assessment, electric cars, and discussing the global prospects for renewable energy. Overall, it is a great tour of the range of issues\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth local and global\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat face environmental engineers, and the tools and technologies that are used to confront them. A note to environmental studies and/or economics majors considering this course: take it! Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any of the particular technologies discussed in this course will be relevant to your career, the most important thing is the engineering PERSPECTIVE it offers. It really changed my understanding of how engineering fits into a social, economic, and political context, and I am better for it. Grading Most of the credit comes from weekly homework assignments and weekly quizzes, both of which are fair and accurate assessments of the course material. There is also a take-home mid-term and a take-home final. The first mid-term was the most difficult and time-consuming part of the course, but Benoit was more than willing to help out during the four-day exam period. Overall, I think grading was fair and thorough.\"",

Compared to the typical introductory engineering course, this one is one of the easier ones, especially if you can do material/mass and energy balances. The only difficult part of the course is the project which gets presented on the last day of class. It is basically a pain - especially because my partner and I chose a really complicated process. I highly recommend finding the simplest process and analyze that, as you will probably still do well and not need to spend many hours working on it. My major complaint with the class was the TA. He was useless, as he would show up to the TA sessions unprepared and on the few occassions he was prepared, he was unable to answer questions clearly. So essentially he was useless as a resource. But, other than that, the course was pretty easy and did not take up too much time each week until the end of the term when the project needed to be completed.\""

            "review 1: \"22F with Jiwon Lee: I really liked this class, and it's very managable. First, Jiwon is a really nice professor. He cares a lot about student's doing well and it's reflected in his grading and exams. I always felt like I was being tested on what I knew, not if I did the problem 100% mathematically correct. This course covers two rather distinct areas of chemical engineering, so there is just a ton of material. It can be very easy to get behind because each lecture covers huge swathes of material. The labs are very low-key and while Lab 1 takes a lot of time for the post lab, the second one does not. The main challenge is that the course starts off with very little to do each week - the midterm doesn't fall until the middle of the term and you only have biweekly psets. However, right around the midterm you get dumped with a whole bunch of stuff, so if you haven't been keeping up with the lectures and psets, it can quickly pile on. Overall, I think this course is really enjoyable. All the exams are fair, labs are related to course materials, and the psets can be difficult but are also solvable. Jiwon is a fairly entertaining lecturer (although it is a 10A block) so the class is not a total slug. Overall, very enjoyable and you will learn a lot.\"",
            "review 2: \"22F with Jiwon Lee: After reflecting, I think this class had the hardest exams I have ever taken at Dartmouth. It was take home, but extremely painful. It was especially difficult because the midterm is crammed around psets and labs.\"",
            "review 3: \"21F with Jiwon Lee: Although the class can definitely be challenging, Jiwon genuinely cares about his students doing well and puts a lot of care into that. I did well mostly because I went to every single TA office hour and asked questions\u2013 the TA's will genuinely save your life with these psets. Also, I agree with the other review that said that due to the heavy technical content of the lectures, the 10A slot makes the lectures a lot harder to parse and they do feel like they drag on. To my understanding, when it came to course material, he mostly used professor Laser's stuff\u2013 so be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on the psets and the midterm and the final. However, he does give you basically two weeks to do each pset and one week to do the midterm, as well as the final (the course had 5 psets, two labs, one midterm, one group final project/presentation, and one final), and obviously the tests were all take-home, so it's not typically an overwhelming amount of work if you know to pace yourself well and start working on things early. Overall, I learnt a lot in this course and I really enjoyed prof. Lee's teaching. He can seem passive-aggressive but he's funny and wants you to do well.\""

The 2-hour time slot (it was a 10A) made lectures seem to drag on on some days, but Prof. Laser tried hard to keep things interesting and use examples from current technologies (mostly green technologies) and putting things into context. He's also very accessible, so it's easy to visit his office to ask questions. The workload was reasonable, although a lot of work was piled up at the end of the term; there's a problem set due almost every week, and a final project on a topic of your choosing. A few problem sets were really long, but most were reasonable. Finals are take-home, and Laser doesn't mind giving extensions if you need more time to work on a problem set.

There are only two psets covering basic material; there is a lack of clarity both about what is expected and what is assigned. The final exam was 1 hr and had rather random, ambiguous questions. On the positive side, our lab instructor, Mary Kay, was helpful. In total, I found little value in the classroom and some value in performing plasmid experiments and hearing speakers on the biotech industry.

In the labs, his instructions were often very vague and sometimes contradictory (about half the class thought the first lab report was done in partners, and the other half individual). He left it up to the TAs to blitz out about what was supposed to be in the lab report's content. The TAs said that he didn't communicate with them well, either (they run and grade the labs, and didn't know when they ran that first one whether it was a partner or individual report). The first exam was far too easy (the lowest grade in the class was apparently an 89%). The second was harder, but fair if it weren't for one question that about half the class misinterpreted the directions for (and Phan was nowhere to be found to ask him about it). The final was good and well-balanced.

You learn essentially a whole ten week's worth of material in seven and a half weeks via the usage of every x-hour and a flipped classroom, and then take a tough final in the middle of Week 8 when you have a lot else going on. However, that's just the beginning - there's also weekly three-hour lab, and then a huge two-week final project complete with final report at the end which people were basically working on constantly during that time. You are in for a ride. The course's organization was pretty questionable, with the worst part being that nothing was graded until Week 10. I heard rumors that this was due to some miscommunications that I bet will be resolved in the future. I'm glad that I ended up doing well, because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have really known until the very end; well past the course's drop deadline. That said, I found the content very interesting, and the lab instructor Ben Dobbins made that whole portion of the course very accessible and streamlined, and knew what he was doing. It's definitely a course worth taking, but I wouldn't with other time-intensive courses if you can avoid it.\"",

The structure of the class was my favorite of all I've taken at Dartmouth - TA's and Prof Luke walk around in class to help small groups with an exercise, and you watch a really short video before coming to class that explains the material, which Prof Luke then expands on. He does a great job breaking down the subject and gives a phenomenal intro to hardware code, which was something I was previously unfamiliar with. Again, it is a LOT of work, but the weekly homeworks are very doable (go to OH as needed), the final is tricky but not a crazy portion of the grade, and the final project is difficult but feels very rewarding once completed.\"",

The final was not particularly difficult and the Professor provided two practice exams that were helpful in preparing for it. The labs were a fair amount of work. I would say they were slightly less work than typical CS course such as CS10, so long as you split the work with a good partner. ENGS 31 used the \"flipped classroom\" structure, where we would read out of the textbook or watch videos before each lecture to cover the content of the lecture, leaving most of the lecture to solve practice problems and ask the Professor/TA/Learning Fellows questions. I really wish more CS/Engineering/Math courses at Dartmouth were structured this way. In these classes, the dense material can often be better absorbed by reading. On the other side it is really useful and enjoyable to get the opportunity to do practice problems for most of the lectures. The problem solving aspect, as opposed to the material covering aspect, is usually the hardest and most rewarding part of most STEM classes and that is why it is so useful to be able to do it while in company of the Professor and classmates. It is also really motivating to be able to show off your hard work from reading the textbook and videos through being able to outperform classmates on the in class problems.\"",

He was easily approachable, highly empathetic to student life and stress, an incredible teacher, and clear about his standards for the class. I don't think this class would have been the same without him. The structure was a weekly problem set and lab that would each take anywhere between 1-4 hours of work.

Daily (though not always) reading quizzes that combine for a total of 10% of the grade. Lastly, there was a final project worth 20% of the grade. The final project is no joke. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE THIS. I don't care how smart you claim to be, the final project has too many parts and too many nit picky pieces to do it last minute.

Overall, incredible class with very useful material for anyone looking to work in mechatronics, electrical engineering, power systems, computer engineering, or mechanical engineering. Even though Thayer's Lord and Savior, Ben, won't be teaching this course again I think this is an excellent class and worth taking as one of your 30s requirements.

So I'll break up the review into two parts: the awesome class and less-than stellar prof. THE CLASS: The grading scheme for 09S and 09x was: Problem Sets 15% Stirling Engine Project 20% Midterms (2, 20% each) Final 25% Problem Sets - They take about 5-8hrs a week. I'd highly recommend going to the TA sessions, because that is where I learned most of the material. Stirling Engine Project - The Stirling engine project takes around 20hrs to get it fully assembled. If you have machine shop experience, you might be able to finish it in 14-16hrs, but don't expect to go much faster than that. Usually assembly is due week 6 of the term. Once you've assembled it, you measure the power and efficiency, then have 2 weeks to tweak it before the competition. Everyone tweaks their engine... and nearly all are worse off than before they started tweaking. LOL. You have the option of doing your own engine project. I wouldn't recommend it, because it's a lot of extra work, and especially don't do it if you don't have machine shop experience. Exams - not much to say here. The class overall is useful and fun. You get a tour of the powerplant and the thayer air conditioning system. You'll learn about enthalpy, entropy and exergy for the first part of the course, then spend a giant chunk on power systems and thermo cycles. The stirling project is really cool and is a great foundation for the machine shop (you get to spend some intimate one-on-one time with most of the machines there). THE PROF: Frost believes that it is a waste of class time to do problems in class, because he assumes that since we are all dartmouth students, we could do a problem presented as if it was trivial. Instead, professor Frost constructs powerpoints out of images from the test and talks about how equations are derived. He'll glance over slides with complex graphs on them, and has a habit of placing 30 lines of algebra on one slide for a derivation. Although I never missed a class, I stopped paying attention at week 2 because it really didn't matter if I was listening or not. The only saving grace for Frost is that he does care about students in a higher-pedagogical nurturing kinda way. He wants students to do well. It's really tragic how he has such good intentions but is so bad at teaching. The other upside is that Frost likes bringing stuff to class as demos. We played around with refrigerators, engines, dry-ice makers and slide rules.\"",

He clearly knows and understands the materials, but his lectures are agonizing and rarely seem to pertain to the material we are supposedly studying (like what was on the homeworks). Once we got into the more chemical engineering side of thermo, most of the class was lost and confused. It was pretty cool to learn about internal combustion engines though, and heating and refrigeration systems weren't too terrible either. Oh, and even though the ORC says that there's no lab, there is a project...the Stirling engine. You have to spend a LOT of time in the machine shop, which is fun, and not too hard, but it is time you can't spend doing other things.\"",

He does get a bit better when it comes down to learning about processes (like engines and air conditioning), which are also more interesting anyways. But you can plan on teaching yourself a lot of stuff (even mostof the stuff) out of the book -- fortunately the textbook isn't too bad. The work consists of a problem set due every week, plus two midterms and a final and your \"project\", building a cute little Stirling engine down in the machine shop. The project takes quite a bit of time, particularly if the machine shop staff decide to give you a hard time. Problem sets get tough -- after the first 2 the difficulty ramped up, as well as the time-consumption. Many of them are long and tedious (some have really complicated algebra), and I got the sense Frost wasn't entirely aware of how time-consuming some of them were. You'll definitely learn a lot; there's some interesting stuff in the course. It's just that a lot of that will be from reading the textbook and working with other students to get through problem sets.\"",

The professor wasn't present at the second exam which he wrote for 3 hours but decided to give during a 65 minute class period instead. Needless to say nobody finished and the exams were graded by him looking over the test and thinking of the grade that he felt that you should have got, which can't be that accurate. He also does not plan to be present during the final. By the end of the class most people had taken to doing their homework instead of taking notes or catching up on sleep.

Apparently it's going to get revamped with more bio and chem, which is a good idea because the systems are so extremely repetitive. However, this class is also rather annoyingly painful.

Her powerpoint are riddled with small mistakes in units or numbers, which is awful for taking notes. It\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s very stressed about lecturing to a group of people, and it leads to poor explanations or her walking in circles when asked a question. Thankfully, the material is not that difficult, so with her lectures and the textbook, you shouldn\u2019t have trouble knowing what you need to pass. The exams are not that difficult either, and the median in the class is ridiculously high. People didn\u2019t do as well on the second exam, but it\u2019s not because the material is difficult - I think people just underestimated the difficulty because the first exam was so easy. That being said, the exams are just stupid. Probably 45-50% of the exams are just some form of a true false questions, which relay much more on nitpicking one word than understanding the material.

However, she always went back and corrected them, and I can't completely fault her because her research isn't strictly about thermodynamics, and this is only her second time teaching the class as far as I know. Although the workload didn't seem bad at first (6 homeworks, very chill labs) the homeworks actually ended up being pretty long and incredibly grindy later on in the term, often involving looking up a ton of different values in various tables and performing the same calculations over and over again. On the plus side, I didn't find the open-note tests super difficult overall, and Professor Samkoe was very flexible and accomodating when we needed it.

He was however, extremely kind as I've already mentioned.

He mentioned at one point that he has never given a timed exam in his life, so I think the take-home style is pretty standard for him and not something he introduced due to COVID. The tests and homework assignments were straightforward and could be done with just the textbook and lecture slides. I disagree with what the other review said about not needing to actually learn anything for the class. I learned a lot along the way through class and lab discussions and honestly, this is the course that filled a lot of gaps for me in terms of my broader understanding of engineering systems. Whereas in other classes you learn the math and theory, I felt like 25 taught me a lot about how that math applies to real systems that we encounter every day.

His thorough knowledge of the material is apparent, demonstrated by how effectively he can convey it to students. Instead of presenting us with pure formulas, he would dive into the theory behind them, welcoming questions as we tried to wrap our minds around antibonding, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, and other such topics that are often glossed over in other courses for simplicity. His presentation slides were clear, detailed, and laced with humor, which was much appreciated during a sobering season of covid. Instead of talking at us for the full sixty-five minutes, he would present, explain, then ask for our input - \u201cSo what would happen here?\u201d \u201cDoes this make sense\u201d - setting us up for success by having us think critically in a zero-stress environment, all of us rapt to the coolness of the topic and well equipped to answer these questions. Prof. Liu was impressively accessible to students, both inside and outside the classroom. I remember once I was struggling over a concept - anti-reflective coating and how complete deconstructive interference could be possible - and I had missed his office hours, so I sent him an email and we hopped on a Zoom link and discussed the wave-particle duality of light for a full half-hour. Mine was not a unique experience. He calls his exams \u201ccelebrations of learning,\u201d and one can\u2019t help but adopt that attitude and agree. The exams are not easy, but rather a rewarding challenge. This approach is in contrast to some other professors\u2019, where one expects low medians that will be curved to adequate, an approach that demoralizes students and leaves them questioning what they have learned. After Prof. Liu\u2019s exams, you felt knowledgeable and triumphant. Prof. Liu consistently went above and beyond. In fact, at the end of the course, he offered to continue with some Zoom seminars on Japanese samurai sword making, magnetic particles, optical sensors, and other topics of interest over the summer. I thought, \u201cThis is what teaching should be.\u201d Prof. Liu's clear dedication to students, mastery of the material, effective communication of that material, focus on understanding, and consistently uplifting mannerisms contributed to a course experience among the best that I\u2019ve had at Thayer.

The quizzes themselves were also super reasonable and very conceptual. He really just wants you to have a gauge of the concepts of whats going on. I also did find the material really interesting, even if it wasn't personally applicable for me. There were also PSETS every week, but were pretty reasonable and TAs were a godsend with them. Worst part about the class was the project. You got paired with a project advisor and got to do an \"exploratory\" materials science research report.

Prof. Lynd has assembled what is basically a textbook of his own, which is much more helpful and relevant to ENGS 22 than the \"real\" textbook. also any HW problems from the textbook are copied for your convenience anyway, so there is really no reason at all to buy it.

An understanding of lumped systems is apparently Really Really Important\u00c2\u00ae if you actually want to become an engineer, so you'll have to take the class eventually. That being said, the material covered is reasonably interesting. The class focuses on deriving models for electrical, chemical, and mechanical systems during the first part of the term, introduces analytical solutions of first and second order differential equations (as well as thermal and environmental systems) during the second part of the term, and focuses upon Laplace transforms and the frequency domain (relevant mostly to electrical systems) for the final portion of the term. Although differential equations play a large role in the class material, the actual analytical solutions and concepts themselves aren't really hard to master, and are limited in scope anyways. The Laplace and s-domain material near the end might be a bit more challenging, but not by much. Although it might be nice, prior background in differential equations isn't really necessary. The MATLAB programming language plays a huge role in the class (both in terms of labs and homework assignments), as numeric solutions are also emphasized. MATLAB is covered in ENGS 20, and is relatively easy to pick up, but if you are not familiar with the software, you will need to make it a point to figure things out and become comfortable with the software before the term proceeds too far.

It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s one of those professors that really belongs solely in research, and is probably teaching mostly based on the fact it\u2019s required for his job at the college. That being said, I will give him credit for putting in more effort than most other professors in the same position. The quizzes are completable in one class period - you have to move quickly but no more quickly than other Dartmouth classes. They\u2019re fair questions, and totally doable. Only real annoyance is that there\u2019s multiple choice section with questions worth like 3-5 points, which I don\u2019t think should be allowed bc it can tank your grade. Zhang\u2019s lectures are nothing to write home about, but I think he\u2019s clear and always gives intermediate steps and give/solve an example for almost every concept.

If you avoid even discussing the homework and go purely for conceptual questions about lectures, etc, then I actually think he\u2019s pretty decent. The biggest roadblock in this class was our homework. The short story is that they decided to revamp the homework this term but could not be bothered to more than change some numbers/questions without ever checking if his changes were, you know, feasible. The homework was sh*tshow for the first three weeks, and could not be solved without the TAs. Some questions were also just not solvable mathmatically at all. Labs are fine.

He sometimes gave away the answer as he worked out a problem exactly from the homework set or at least something very similar. -The labs required a lot of matlab. Personally, I was never super great at it so it was a struggle but not impossible.

I usually started the sets on Thursdays or Fridays but I also had friends who were able to answer my general questions that they had asked TAs way earlier throughout the week. Sometimes the way to solve the homeworks required tips and tricks that you wouldn't otherwise obtain unless you asked a TA for help. I thought that was totally unfair but I mean, as long as you're on top of it, you'll do perfectly fine. You shouldn't worry too much about labs or homework. The exams are what bring your grade down. -exams were uh something else. I had nearly perfect on every assignment except the quizzes. Those bring you down.

            "review 2: \"20F with Amro Farid: Let me start by saying that this class is a truly interesting class. The Thayer faculty often say if they could bring engineering down to a couple of classes, Engs 22 and 23 would be it. I personally found it to be an engaging subject and indeed, I enjoy the way my mind thinks now after the class. However, I highly recommend NOT taking it with Professor Amro Farid. Previous reviews have touched on him, all of which I agree to be true. He is quite an intelligent man; he has a strong background and actually researches some pretty interesting material -- material that he can go on for a while talking about. However, when it comes to teaching this class, he will disappoint you as he did me. He teaches with a flipped classroom and breakout rooms during synchronous lecture time. I'm generally okay with the flipped classroom style but it does not really work for heavier classes such as systems without some guidance, which he does not really offer. Amro has made a large Course Reader pdf file for the entire course and for each day, he posts the lecture notes associated with that day. For each set of notes, he has a small set of videos to go over them. The issue here though is that these videos do not add to the notes whatsoever. In fact, all he does during these videos is read whatever is on his course lecture notes, verbatim, and pretends that he has taught you material. He will often say phrases, such as \"it is worthwhile knowing ___,\" expecting you to immediately know what he is talking about, whether it be a physical or mathematical concept. The videos are also counterproductive in that they teach mathematical concepts via a slideshow method, never truly showing were a formula comes from or where a certain step was taken. If a formula is needed, Amro will often refer to a formula's number in the notes rather than the actual formula itself. As someone who does quite well with math, I know it is difficult for people to learn math when it is being taught with no steps. In addition, during the videos he will read over questions he asks in the course notes and then will proceed to say \"I hope to discuss this in class on ___\" and then will never once mention it during class, which is its own issue. His \"class\" is an hour of breakout rooms, which he often shows up late to and takes at least 10-15 minutes to set up. The setup was also done poorly -- each day had its own page on a google spreadsheet where people could sign up for which breakout room (limited to 10-12 people) they wanted to be in including, homework problems, example problems, practice, or more practice, each led by a different TA or Amro himself. This was extremely inefficient, as the homework would often fill up quickly, leaving others to sign up for slots that did not really help them. It was essentially a very poorly run office hour. During \"class\" he would often get annoyed if a question was asked that was in the notes (notes he never really explained). His assignments were doable but occasionally he would ask questions that were unclear or missed something that you could not possibly know without going to a TA. The exams were fair and did a good comprehensive review of the material. That was the saving grace of this class -- the material. Once you understand the initial content, the actual learning gets easier and more interesting. And when you finally do understand his methods to problems, you'll realize it's actually quite genius. If only it were taught better :) I understand that it is an online term and it is difficult for everyone, but overall a poor experience with the professor but a great course.\"",

In actuality I found his lectures very unhelpful, in fact the most unhelpful of all professors I've had so far here. Farid seems like a smart guy, but his lectures aren't helpful primarily because he tries to teach math from powerpoint slides. In all the 5 or so lectures I attended, I can't remember him ever using the chalk board. This might be fine for history. But in learning math, let alone differential equations, power point slides are highly ineffective. Farid would go through a derivation in the slides and after about 2 to 3 slides I became lost for the rest of the lecture. I am normally a top student in math, so this surprised me. After 5 lectures I realized I would have to teach myself the whole course, which I was unwilling to do with my schedule.\"",
            "review 4: \"16F with Amro Farid: Hello, I think the previous review on Farid is a little unfair. All in all, a lot of people will tell you that he was a bad professor and a bad teacher. To be honest, he's a 5/10 teacher and a 8/10 mentor. He devotes lots of office hours time to people who take the time and effort to go in and ask questions. He once skipped two important meetings to answer questions for me and only two other people out of the 40 or 50 something total students taking the class this term. He could have been rude/sarcastic at some points, tending to respond to some questions in class with \"You should understand/know this/that from your /insert_prereq_class_here\" and he won't really answer a question straightforwardly. Although for more complex questions, sure he'll take the time to answer. I think he really tries to get across the important points without taking too much time to cover prereq knowledge. This is understandable but also not fair to some people who haven't recently taken calculus/applied math/physics. I think he still ended up being an okay professor because he really did take care of us in a way where he constantly told us not to worry about grades and just show him we are trying. A lot of people thought he was very prideful and wanted to stand on top of us by only covering new/harder material constantly while ignoring people who were behind. In my opinion, if you tried to go into office hours at all or go to TA hours, you were rewarded HEAVILY compared to people who kept working alone without using their resources. In my opinion, a good amount of people who complain about this class and pin the blame on Farid did not really take the time to use the class resources available. Sure, some did and some still complain because the class was extremely difficult, but that doesn't mean I or anyone else should let our pride get in the way of learning something challenging. \"I am normally a top student in math, so this surprised me.\" - Previous review on Farid. Nothing should surprise you just because it looks hard and just the feeling of utter confusion makes you lose your reasoning. We're all top students. That's why we're here. We shouldn't ignore a challenge just because the professor isn't someone we're necessarily used to.

            "review 1: \"19W with John Collier: This class was not, in my opinion, like what I had heard about it beforehand or read in the reviews in terms of time commitment, difficulty, etc. I wouldn't describe it as a crazy time commitment for the entire time, I'd say it was comparable to any other STEM course for the first 7 weeks or so, with some spikes before the presentations, as would be expected. Then in the last 2 weeks, if you haven't been on top of everything perfectly, you realize you have about 10 days to build your entire device at which point it becomes a 4-8 hour per day commitment every day - I would say my group spent 25-30 hours working on the project and presentation week 9-10. I would not describe this course as \"fun\"; it's too stressful and too high stakes for that. Rewarding? Absolutely, by far the most rewarding course I've taken at Dartmouth, it really shows you what you're capable of, and there's nothing quite like the feeling of finishing your project and walking out of the room from the final presentation knowing you were successful. I don't think I've ever cared about a class more which was probably part of why it was so stressful. Collier was great and always more than happy to give ideas and help out with projects. My advice would be to stay on top of your project as early as possible to reduce how backloaded the course becomes, and don't get discouraged if you don't always get the best feedback from the review board, it happens but it will turn out ok!\"",
            "review 2: \"17W with John Collier: A fun course, though a substantial time commitment. That said, it's not the kind of grindy how-the-heck-do-I-solve-this-calculus kind of time commitment; the hours mostly go into building a thing which is really low stress (provided it's not last minute). Aside from that there are 3ish progress reports that have very specific rubrics, so follow them to the T. You really learn a lot about making stuff, and you have what seems like every possible resource at your disposal: experts, machinery, materials, money, etc.\"",
            "review 3: \"09F with John Collier: Chances are, nothing I say will affect whether you take the course. Either you're an Engs major and you will take the course, or you're not a major, and you won't. So here's some advice for When you take this course. Read the rubrics the moment they are posted. Your entire grade is based on rubrics. There's one for each written report, and 1 for each oral report. There is a heck of a lot to cover, and several of the topics on each rubric require enormous time commitments. Know ahead of time what you have to do. Don't just speed away on your project until you've carefully read over the rubric and know exactly what has to be accomplished. For better or for worse, the rubrics are graded rather robotically. Office hours don't exist, but go to them anyways. You might try hard to find office hours posted on the syllabus or course outline, but there are none. Instead, his office hours are 'most of the day, every day'. If you need to talk to him, just visit Amanda Perry (his assistant), or blitz him, and get an appointment, probably for the same day. Also, he often visits Couch lab a few nights a week, so grab him then. Visit other profs. If your project has a lot of electrical components, visit the Engs 32 prof. If your project involves stress and strain, visit Prof Diamond. Whatever it is, go talk to people who know more than you about your subject matter, or the review board will get you for it. Last minute is ok. You will probably have several all-nighters, and not because you procrastinated - because it's required. Thayer is open 24 hours (with free coffee) if you have your DID with you, so use all 24 of them if necessary. Rooms are open all night that you can practice your oral presentations in. Also, don't be intimidated by the binding process (you have to bind your reports), it only takes 20 minutes day-of. Practice your oral presentations several times. With a couple different people talking about a lot of different topics, it's easy for something to fall through the cracks. Practice several times, and grade each other using the rubrics (harshly), so that you can shore up any weaknesses. Don't try to B.S. Professor Collier. If there's a reason you didn't accomplish something (perhaps because you didn't read the rubrics early enough?), the truth or nothing is better than stretching the truth. I don't know from experience, because we got the same advice, but still. Don't bother trying. Get on Kevin Baron's good side (the machine shop instructor) A hint: if there are 3 sequential lectures by 3 different profs on Sustainability, Liability, and Ethicality, and the rubric for the final report/presentation has 3 boxes with those topics: don't ignore the coincidence. Many people didn't realize the connection. Go into the online lecture notes, and use the guidelines that the lecture lays out as the frame for your discussion. Don't forget to do weekly goals with your TA. Just because no one reminds you to do them after week 1 doesn't mean you don't have to do them. Your notebook (everything you ever do or research or test) is 5% of your term grade. It's graded relatively easily, though. Good luck!\"",
            "review 4: \"09F with John Collier: If you are an engineering major, this will probably be the best course you ever take at Dartmouth. If you are not a major, you will drop out. Expect to donate the majority of your outside-of-class time to this class - by the end of the project you will be spending everyday and night at Thayer. Group choice really is the most important decision you'll make in this class, as the group makes or breaks ES21. However, it is possible to start out with a group that doesn't get along and, through hardship and tough times, turn out with a fantastic product. But everything in ES21 takes effort. This is probably as close to real-life as you're going to get. Professor Collier knows this class is extremely hard, but hey - so is real-life. He's at first imposing, like the other members of the board, but once you start talking to him outside the presentations, he's extremely helpful. Take his advice and run with it. Read through older reviews, because they offer great advice. ES21 is the pledge term for engineers.\"",
            "review 5: \"08F with John Collier: Basically this is an engineering design course, you go from idea to prototype in 10 weeks. With that said, this course is really interesting but very time demanding, especially at the end of the term. The project is your grade, the effort you and your group put into it gives back the grade. There are 3-4 presentations throughout the course and 3-4 papers but there's no homework, tests or anything else since the project is the course. Pick a simple project that suits the group strengths, organize team roles, and ask plenty of questions since the staff and TA's are at your disposal. Group dynamics play a major role in the course and it's important to be on the same page in every aspect of the project. Plan on spending at least 20 hours a week if you want to get a good grade in the course. The lectures are useful too but as long as one or two members of your group go, you don't have to worry about it as much. Don't take this course for fun, only if you're seriously considering the ENGS major. It's pretty fun though and hard work pays off at the end.\"",
            "review 6: \"08F with John Collier: Collier is an awesome and enthusiastic prof, but be as careful as you can choosing your group since that's what will make or break the class for you.\"",
            "review 7: \"08F with John Collier: This class is incredibly dependent on what group and TA you are assigned to. You might end up in a group in which you shall find you future spouse and best friend, and together with the help of a dedicated TA you guys create an incredible invention and get an A. More likely you will get into a group of people who are not all that interested in your project, who you have trouble relating and working with, and who are not even guarenteed to know english. Dont take this as a freshman in fall, you have enough stuff going around you than to commit to this course, which requires an enourmous amount of commitment. Even better wait for people you know you can work well with to take this course so you can at least be guarenteed one dedicated member in your group. And if you are not majoring in engineering, there are plenty of other cool engineering classes that are just as interesting as this one but do not require you to abandon your other classes just to finish your project.\"",
            "review 8: \"08F with John Collier: prof. robbie lectured more than collier, which is good because he had good presentations. if you take this course, try and settle on a meaningful project that optimally you can get passionate about, otherwise it is hard to put in the hours efficiently. also, skills acquisition is largely left up to oneself as the need (perhaps) arises\"",
            "review 9: \"08F with John Collier: I'd definitely only recommend taking this class if you are an ENGS major. However, this class made me really excited to be an ENGS major, and happy with my decision to be an engineering major! I'd say the most important part of the class is picking a good group that you know will put in a lot of effort, and people you don't mind spending a lot of time around! If you have a great group, the class can be a lot of fun. If you have a group you hate, it can make the class miserable. Picking your project is probably the hardest part. Building it is the most fun part, learning to use the machine shop and CAD is awesome. That being said, get into the machine shop early to get machines. If you wait until the last 2 weeks the machine shop is really busy. There were 3 presentations and reports. If you follow the grading rubric that Collier gives you exactly, it's not hard to get a decent grade. You'll probably neglect your other 2 classes, so try to pick other classes that aren't impossible. I know a lot of people took 33 with 21, and that wasn't too bad. Collier is awesome. He is SO helpful. If you need anything, just ask him. He's always at Thayer, and he's willing to do anything to help you with your project. So, although you might live at Thayer for the term, this class is a ton of fun if you enjoy your group and the project that you picked. Hanging out at Thayer with your friends beats sitting in the library by yourself. After this class, you'll finally start to feel like an engineer! Also, don't worry if you have 0 knowledge of how to to anything before this class. You don't need to, and by the end you'll know how to do a ton of stuff!\"",
            "review 10: \"08F with John Collier: this class can be really really really great or it could be a nightmare. make sure you choose a group you can depend on, and people you don't mind spending basically your whole term with. some ta's are more helpful than others, but that's just the luck of the draw (each group of 4-5 has one ta assigned to them). but really, work with people you KNOW are dependable and who communicate well together. things will inevitably get rough somewhere along the way and you need to all keep moving forward. Professor Collier really goes out of his way to help students out. his lectures were interesting and dynamic. He starts the class off telling you that you won't have any homework or tests, which is true, but you do have three presentation/reports. DO NOT SAVE THESE FOR THE LAST MINUTE. they WILL take more time than you think they will. the graders are tough but fair, and if you haven't done much it will show. as the term goes on, you'll find professor collier is always somewhere in the building, ready to help you with any questions you might have. if you have to do anything in the machine shop, try getting there earlier in the term, or at least earlier in the day. space and machinery is limited, and however long you think it will take you to finish your work in the machine shop, multiply that time by three. i'm not kidding. the people in the machine shop are really helpful, so, if you're like me and have never used machinery of any sort, don't worry. that said, i really enjoyed the class. i learned way more than i have in any other class, and worked harder than ever before. i probably spent more time in thayer than out of it, but it was worth it. don't take other hard classes with this one. whatever you put in this class is what you'll get out of it, so you want to be able to focus in on this one. TAKE IT! its worth it. and the professor is awesome. and when you're done with it, especially if this is your first class in thayer, you really feel like you're a part of the thayer community.\"",
            "review 11: \"08F with John Collier: Professor Collier is so amazing! He really goes out of his way to be accessible and helpful. We do have \"skills sessions\" every week which i would have thought counted as a lab course... role was not taken in lectures, and by the end almost a third of the class didn't actually show up. I liked the profs who came into our class to do a lecture, but the best classes were when professor collier taught them. one of the best profs i have ever had. and... no tests! (excluding 3 papers and 3 presentations)\"",
            "review 12: \"08F with John Collier: This class is a time vacuum. Expect to spend a LOT of time on it. It can be fun if you get a good group, and it is a lot of hard work. Prof. Collier is awesome and you will definitely learn a lot from this class. Just make sure you work on it ALL THE TIME because otherwise you will fall behind, which will be very obvious when you give your presentation. I took this class at the same time as Bio12 and Anth33 and I probably could have handled a higher workload, but not by much.\"",
            "review 13: \"07F with John Collier: ok, so dont go into 21 expecting to learn science behind engineering. after taking and talking to the prof the point of the course is to teach u the engineering process, or at least put u through it once before throwing u into the science. a lot of professional engineering is learning on the job, and this is what this class makes u do, or so i'm assuming. wait till 22 for science, but 21 is all about showing the engineering dept that u have what it takes to survive in the real world. so why the flawed vs genius? for one theres WAY too much writing. maybe this is a flaw, but maybe its the way it really is in the real world... second the whole group picking thing, its TOTALLY hit or miss whether ull end up with a group that decides to do work, or cares about ur grade as much as u do... totally a learn by fire way about teaching u about team building and teamwork... flaw or genius? also some advice, dont base ur prog reps competely on the grade sheet, especially the written portions. go to collier and force him to specifiy exactly what he wants that different from the previous reports, or ul get burned, like i did...\"",
            "review 14: \"07F with John Collier: ...or if you're considering the major. This is an introduction class, so they do not expect you to have prior engineering experience or knowledge coming in, although it can help if you do, depending on what your project is. Either way, there are many, many resources to call upon to get the project done. That being said, it's A LOT of work. And it's not evenly distributed. I worked about 6-12 hours a week on the project for the first 8 weeks of the term, then between 40 and 50 hours the final week. Keep on top of the work and you'll be fine - and also keep on top of the work in all your other classes so you can afford to either skip assignments or do half-assed jobs on them if you have to by the end. This is basically a weeding-out class that shows you what engineering entails, in very broad overview, so you can see if it's something you want to pursue or not. It's fun overall - you get to make a product mostly of your own choosing and work through the development of it - but you shouldn't try to take it just as a TAS requirement or because you have a vague interest in the area (that's what ENGS 12 is for). One last bit of advice - if no one in your group has done any machine shop work before (as happened in my group), estimate the amount of time it'll take for you to machine and assemble your prototype, multiply it by 10, and that's how long it will actually take. That would have really helped my group to know going into it.\"",
            "review 15: \"07F with John Collier: so you may think this class is all about building some amazing device that's going to save the world and bring you fortune in fame...well, i suppose it can be. it's really a matter of commitment and making good choices. pick a good group; people who know each other tend to hold each other more accountable than strangers might. also, be prepared to do your part - whatever it may be. a lot of your grade depends on how well you write your reports and present your progress. a lot of the time it seems like a bunch of BS, but that's how a lot of things in life are. you don't do shit for awhile, you scramble as the deadline approaches, and you try your best to make it look like you've done a lot. oh, and the review board loves solidworks graphics. also, try to have a working prototype by the 2nd progress report...it makes the final presentation a lot less stressful.\"",
            "review 16: \"07F with John Collier: I was expecting this class to be really really fun and interesting, and it was only somewhat fun and kind of interesting. The information you learn about the design process is essential for any engineer, but the nitpicking process that you have to go through for the project is so frustrating. It seemed like the whole class really came down to being able to match up our presentations to the grading rubric, which took so much away from the design element of the class. Also what will make or break your Engs 21 experience is your group. Do you best to get a group that works well together and splits up the work evenly. Getting stuck doing all the work is super stressful and extremely annoying. I guess one good thing to say about the class is that you get good at making powerpoints and giving presentations.\"",
            "review 17: \"07F with John Collier: The frustrating thing about this class is that they (the prof and the review board) expect so much from you. You are never able to do anything to the extent you want to because you just have to keep going through this. This is one of the classes where 10 weeks is definitely too short. The reports are helpful in providing a benchmark for your work, but they are so consuming. You'll be working along and then suddenly you essentially have to stop everything so that you can write a giant report and prepare a great presentation. Then, you're all off track. And this happens repeatedly. Expect to spend the 2-3 days prior to every report only doing that report. You'll only break to do the work you have for other classes (try to do that ahead of time!) Much of the class is also figuring out how to work in a group. It's perfectly fine to work with people you don't know before the class starts: follow your gut.\"",
            "review 18: \"07F with John Collier: this class is useless unless you have a very good idea of what you want to build before you take it. Your group dictates how much work/fun you have and collier makes you do all sorts of research, etc that takes away time to actually build anything.\"",
            "review 19: \"06F with John Collier: This class was mostly a waste of time. If I wanted to be a welder or a carpenter I would have went to a trade school. I didn't learn anything and spent a lot of time making our projects and reports look pretty so that we'd get a good grade. Be sure to pick an easy and get a good group. You don't get any extra points for tackling a tough obstacle.\"",

It can be very rewarding, but is incredibly time consuming. Expect to spend long hours conducting surveys and working in the project lab. All of your grades are determined by 4 oral and 4 written reports, which detail the work you've been doing on your project. Your project group is the most important part of this course, make sure you're in a good group. You may be tempted to blow off the whole group-selection process in the beginning of the term, but DON'T -- your group will decide whether the next three months are manageable or miserable. Collier is very helpful, as are the other folks -- ask for help, you will need it.\"",

            "review 22: \"05F with John Collier: The class is more a business or a communication class with a vague technical emphasis than an engineering class. It focused on following a very specific form documentation rather than inventing something worthwhile. The grading favors simple mechanical projects, regardless of any potential usefulness, as opposed to systems or theoretical projects. The review board was generally not helpful, and often misleading, in their comments. Lectures were a waste of time and provided no actual information. The prof was very nice guy, but the entire class is based around a set of ill-defined guidelines that can be explained in about 20 minutes; definitely, not worth a term of lectures. A couple of guest lecturers were good, but their information wasnt directly applicable to the completion of the project; it was just interesting information.\"",

I loved my group, so though we spent a lot of time on the project, it was fun time and I didn't mind it. Prof Collier does not give tests, quizzes, or homework. The only work for the class is the project you decide to work on and basically invent; this in itself is very time consuming. Our grade was based on a proposal, 2 progress reports, and a final presentation. Each of these consists of a group paper you turn in and a powerpoint presentation in front of a board of professors. The grading is fair and the board is generally very encouraging. Most of the work comes right before a report is due; if you can work consistently throughout the term this may not happen, but I feel as though this is very difficult to do. Work on generating ideas for your proposal early on in the class though; you only have about a week to do this and if you wait til the last minute you will have a lot of work to do the night before! The final comes up quickly too because it is due 2 or 3 days after Thanksgiving; this is nice because you are done with the class before reading period, but calls for a lot of work immediately after the Thanksgiving break..try to plan ahead of time for this!

You want to choose something where you can have a working prototype which you have tested by Progress Report 2 (two weeks before the final). Our group chose a particularly difficult project, and though we worked it through and came out with a solution and working prototype just before the final, the difficulty of our project meant that we had a lot more work to do in order to get to where some of the other groups where whose problems weren't as complex. The course isn't really about saving the world, but about the \"engineering process\" where you take your idea, build a prototype, test it and then make changes to improve it. A hard project makes getting through the process more difficult. Simple mechanical or electrical problems are good: something like \"design a better umbrella\" -- that way there's a clear idea of where the project is going and what needs to be done. A good thing to do, would be to ask Collier (or whoever is teaching the course) about your project idea, and see what comments he has. Also in choosing a problem, I would suggest not necessarily to try to come up with a list of known problems off the top of your head, but rather to find areas or fields which are of interest to all group members and then see what problems exist that would be good to tackle in that particular field.\"",

The course confirmed my decision to be an ENGS major and reminded me why I love it so much. We worked in groups the entire term to produce something that actually works. The group that you're a part of can make or break the class. You may select other members of your group or opt for a random group, either way you want to make sure you have people with similar schedules to you. If there is a TA you think would be good, don't be afraid to request that person. Whoever is in your group you will be spending a lot of time with them over the course of the term. Collier was interesting and did a good job of providing interesting examples from previous years. The class was all about learning HOW to think and HOW to go through the design process. Everything that we learned in this class can be used in future ENGS courses and other projects. I advise taking the class towards the begining of your Dartmouth career so you have a better idea of what engineering is about.\"",

Some projects are just harder than others, but the extra effort required by these projects is rewarded with better grades and the chance to win 500 (which goes to the single group with the best project at the end of the term).

The work comes and goes in cycles, you probably won't do much work between reports but the few days leading up to one of the 4 required reports expect to work on it for 2-3 days straight. It's pretty intense. Collier is a good prof and he's readily available throughout the term.

It would not be advisable to take this course concurrently with a subject you find very difficult, or with another lab course. You will need to find many hours in the day you did not think were even there to be devoted to schoolwork, doing the work for this course. If you are truly interested in engineering, you will love this course, though you will find it grueling and painful at times. If you are not interested in the problems engineers face, you will certainly find out in this course! and may well wind up dropping it. However, it is important to stick with it and remain undaunted by the work if this is truly a pursuit you wish to explore. The only way you get something out of it is going through the process. You have to follow the methodology. The course is focused a lot on presenting, both orally and in written form. I highly recommend this course, even though I would be wary of taking another one like it again in the near future, because it is very taxing.\""

            "review 1: \"09S with William Lotko: Basically there are teams of 4 to 5 students, and then it's like: this is the Thayer School of Engineering.....Go! Throughout the term there are 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153milestones\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which consist of a written and/or (usually and) oral presentation to a review board. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the class is hard in the sense that the material is difficult, instead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about putting in a huge amount of effort. Basically the first milestone feels like a normal term\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s week of midterms, the second milestone feels like a whole finals week\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so you can only imagine how much work the final milestone is. Actually making the product is a lot of the work of course, but there may be more than you think that goes into that. In order to get to the production stage you must brainstorm, research existing technology and patents, research the consumer and other stakeholders, analyze specifications of your product, mathematically model your product's performance, create CAD models, etc. Then once you make you product you have to test it and compare it to existing technology. Then you have to keep modifying and retesting your product for the top performance. And believe me this in not a smooth process, everything takes longer than it should, and a lot of issues come up, including: -Every idea that you come up with is taken -You are assigned to the TA that does nothing -After the first, second or third milestone the professor and review board don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like your project forcing you to switch for the sake of your grade -No one in your group knows how to use CAD -The majority of your group officially and/or unofficially drops out of the class leaving you with all the work (grades are given by group, but they can shift for individuals based on circumstances, but still, it sucks) -You are enrolled in other classes -You think you have a final prototype but it breaks a couple days before the final presentation -There is group tension\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tears are shed -You drop your prototype in the river -Assembly of your prototypes takes forever\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Your first test happens in front of the review board during your final presentation As far as groups, I would definitely recommend having a group set up going into the class. You rely on your group members all the time and are also with them for most of your time. You can basically choose your group if you have one set up, there is a questionnaire given out in the first week, and in it you can select people that you would like to work with. Groups are assembled based on these, and I think it almost always works out that if you have a group in mind you get it. Also, a lot of people are worried that they will do horribly if their prototype, but that's not as much as a concern as you might think. Actually, a surprisingly small amount of your grade is based on the final prototype. Grades are given by performance on the written reports and oral presentations, which largely consist of the things listed above (consumer research, testing, mathematical modeling, etc). When it really comes down to it, your grade is based on what you show Lotko and the review board, not necessarily how much work you actually do. So don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the last minute to put together your reports and make your powerpoint presentations because that is what your actually being graded on! The review board will reward you for great looking slides and slick speaking even if your material is a little thin. Meanwhile, if you show up flustered and unprepared, you will get bad results from the review board even if you put in tons of work. Presentation beats Material. Also, the review board loves powerpoint slides that are well put together. Lots of pictures, lots of charts, few words. Well, lectures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually important to the class, but you can get an individual grade boost if you attend. Sometimes Lotko goes over the stuff that should be in upcoming reports. These lectures are usually boring. Generally, guest lecturers come in a talk about their specialty and how it relates to the class and engineering as a whole. These lectures are obviously hit or miss based on wether or not the speaker is good and their subject is interesting. Professor Lotko is great! He puts in a ton of effort into this class too! He spends tons of time outside of class with each group. He is always quick to set up meetings and answer questions via blitz. He really gets to know every group and guides them along their way. I have heard that the other professor is good too, and because of the nature of the class, I would say taking the class with friends is more important that which professor you take it with. Despite (maybe because of) how much work this class is, it is a great experience. You will feel like you have truly become comfortable at the thayer school of engineering. Also, you will feel really proud of the work that you have put in, and you will be able to see it come together in an actual product. Plus it's great to be able to share this feeling with group members.\"",

Working with my group, I learned about helpful resources in the Thayer school, how to operate equipment in the machine shop, and how to work with other people to achieve the best results in a product design class. This course requires a ton of work outside of class, especially at the last minute, no matter how well you prepare.

And that board (consisting of 5 members) is who you present to. They're some Thayer hotshot profs who think they can judge you, and they're right. What's expected of you during the term is for your group to successfully work together and solve some problem (according to their guidelines which change every term). You have to go all the way from alternatives to implementations to product design. You build a prototype and by the end of the course you test it and pray to god that it works. BE PREPARED FOR ALL KINDS OF STUFF TO BREAK LOOSE DURING THE TENSE PARTS OF THIS COURSE This \"stuff breaking loose\" could be categorized by, but is not limited to, the following: - the printer not working - all of Thayer running out of paper - your prototype exploding in your face - you finding your exact damn idea patented on the internet a week from the end of the term - arguments among teammates - the board chewing up your project and spitting it back at you - lack of sleep for 48 hours straight - dependence on Red Bull - Word acting like a bitch - 30MB PowerPoint presentations - necessity to beg friends to contribute to project via test results / surveys - having to start your project over - decreased social life - first-name basis with EBA's delivery guy - running out of money and having to ask for more - TA's disappearing for a week Oh yeah, there's also a $500 Jackson Prize that one of the groups wins based on god knows what criteria.\"",

Written proposals are not bad if divided up between the team, but if you have a slacker group member, be ready to lose a social life in order to finish the project on time. Lots of different types of people in this class makes it interesting; my group was a history major, an engineering senior, a math major, and another engineering freshman. Being in a group forces you to think and prioritize work because you are the ones responsible for actually making your project. There were a lot of guest lecturers, and going to every lecture wasn't necessary, as long as one member of your group was there. Often, those class times can be spent better downstairs making your project.

I found the class to be very frustrating because it isn't really about anything scientific. The people who receive the best grades aren't the people with the best project, but rather the people who are best at giving the review board what they want. Most of the things that you will write about in your report will be completely made-up. For example, you have to come up with an \"econ plan\" for your project. Essentially, you just pull numbers out of thin air for the costs and come up with some ridiculous profit that your product would never achieve. Basically, the course is an introduction to all the resources that are available at Thayer and it gives you an opportunity to meet a lot of professors, etc. That said, you will not really learn anything that you can take away from the class unless you are an engineering major/minor.

Plus, good luck getting anything graded on time, as almost half of the individual assignments were still left ungraded in canvas after the term had ended. Utilize the machine shop and all Thayer resources to your advantage, they will help you so much, and a bonus for being able to reference others' help on your various presentations to show that you actually spent time talking to people outside of your group for your project. Speaking of which, you should definitely send out surveys and \"need-find\" BEFORE your proposal presentation. They don't make that very clear, and by the time we were making our proposal presentation, we were pitching a shark tank idea with not a single non-group member telling us it was a problem, which doesn't make our project sound very convincing. Have some data and numbers to back up WHY the project must be done in the first place, and even better if you gather that data \"from the field\" yourself; otherwise, the review board won't like your proposal presentation very much.\"",

The review board is no help when deciding a product to make: they say if it'll be difficult or hard but at that point it's kinda difficult to switch. I don't understand why they frame this as an intro class because if no one in my group knew anything before, we would have failed. Make sure you have a good group. In pretty much every group I talked with someone just ditched part way through the term or didn't contribute at all. It's inevitable and there's not an accountability system for it until the end. My one suggestion to make this class achievable: make something MECHANICAL. Don't use any electronics or anything else. just make it mechanical. 3D print stuff and build stuff out of wood. Stay away from Arduinos. Also sign up for practice presentations with the TAs. Those force you to do stuff early which is good.\"",

Many other times, it made me want to leave the field entirely. The first six weeks of the class felt really directionless. You're tasked at once with getting to know your group members, figuring out who will be good at doing what, and overcoming procrastination in an attempt to do as much as you can early on to avoid stressing yourself out later on in the class. At this point, it's really tough to tell whether your project will actually be feasible in ten weeks' time, and what elements of it are worth highlighting to the Review Board. To make this part as painless as possible, I strongly recommend that (as many other reviews emphasize!) in Week 1 you spend more time than you think you'll need meeting people in the class and seeing who you mesh well with. Week 7 through the end actually worked really well for me. Although the workload ramped up like crazy, my group was able to get lots more help from our TA, technical instructor, and Professor Snyder. Definitely seek out these resources early on, and you'll have a lot easier of a time. Professor Snyder is a super kind guy, and was very helpful whenever we went to him for any help. However, I honestly think you could take this class with any professor and be okay - they don't have much influence when you're hastily working with your group on your presentation late at night for the next day. The class tries to fit too much into too little of a time; a lot of the lectures, while well-meaning, were not as valuable as getting additional time in Couch would have been with some assigned reading or notes. It made me stronger, and I could tell a lot of the people in the class really enjoyed it (you may end up loving it!), but I'm glad that it's over now. That said, if you're reading this midway through the term and stressing out about this class, YOU CAN DO IT, and you will be just fine in the end!\""

It was her first term teaching so I can cut her some slack, but given the complexity of the class she needed to be a lot more on top of getting out information and grades and making sure everything was running smoothly. If anything, this class is more of an intro to Thayer than an intro to engineering since it forces you to engage with all different parts of the school for success on the project, and it definitely pigeonholes all of engineering into the kind that Thayer likes to promote: very design-based, business-oriented, user-centered, etc etc etc (this was the part of the class that annoyed me the most).

Liz let you request ppl if you wanted but assigned groups otherwise, which I imagine could be a blessing or a curse depending on the type of person you are.

There were three total long assignments. The first two were in C and the last was in Matlab. I found the first and the third long assignments nearly inaccessible. They used statistical and differential equations, respectively, that I had never learned and wasn't able to understand by simply reading the assignments or perusing the internet.

I had no programming experience going into college, yet this course made me want to be a CS major. (I later took CS 1 in addition to ENGS 20, which is why I contrast the two throughout this review.) In my experience, ENGS 20 was a better introduction to programming than CS 1. Starting with C as a programming language forces you to understand concepts like pointers, memory allocation, and the scope of variables. It makes learning Python so much simpler, yet so much richer. (I often had a great appreciation for what my CS 1 classmates took for granted, such as lists and declaring something \"global\" and instantly giving it global scope.) ENGS 20 is a model introductory computer science course. It starts with binary, progresses to simple programs, builds to functions, then finishes with data structures. If you truly want to understand the foundation of programming, take this course. If you want to learn more languages beyond C, take this course. If you've never written a line of code and are debating between taking this course or CS 1, take this course. This course will not be easy, but nor will CS 1. I found the pace of this course perfect for someone who had never coded. I was never confused, nor was I ever bored. (Many of my friends in CS 1 found it difficult to pay attention in that class; ENGS 20 was so much more engaging.) The questions asked in my ENGS 20 class suggested that the pace was appropriate for most people: people were asking clarifying conceptual questions, not \"I'm lost\" questions. CS 1 is usually taught in a class with 130-180 people; ENGS 20 has closer to 25-35, which meant questions were more frequent and at more appropriate times. (When we declared an array, someone asked what was in it until it was initialized.) Shepherd made it so easy to pay attention. He handed out his notes, which explained concepts, and spent the duration of class explaining them and answering our questions. We then applied the concepts by coming up with code ourselves during daily short assignments. CS 1 is a lot more of \"blind code copying\" during class and then figuring out how to use it. I didn't \"copy\" a single line of code for ENGS 20; I simply wrote it as I went because I understood how to use everything. You will learn so much in this course, and it is taught by phenomenal professors. This is the most rewarding class I've ever taken.

Everything is on the slides that Shepherd makes, and basically no one ever looks at the book after the first day. Shepherd is very chill, funny, approachable and available. The short assignments were very helpful in learning concepts, and the longer assignments made us critically think and combine these concepts. The 4 long assignments could be frustrating at times, but if you start early and go to TA hours/office hours, you will be fine. One problem I did have was that shepherd stopped assigning short assignments halfway through the term and we basically had long assignments from then on. That made it tougher to practice the concepts that we needed for the long assignments/tests. The midterms were not too bad (the medians were in the high 70s) and very much like the practice midterms that Shepherd gives, but I thought the final was very tough. I thought the course was comparable, and maybe a little bit tougher and more of a workload than the other engs prereqs, however I know that for some people who programming didn't come to as easily, the course was very difficult and frustrating.\"",

Some students definitely pick up programming faster than others do. It is helpful to have some prior programming experience, but is not necessary to succeed in the class. I thought that Professor Shepherd's lectures were very well organized. The short assignments were helpful in learning the basic material. The practice exams were very useful to have for the midterms and final. I wish that there were more practice problems to do. Unfortunately, the textbook (especially for MatLab) was not very helpful and did not have very good practice problems. Although I thought that the longer assignments were good, I wish that we also had short assignments concurrently, to help the students learn the basic material. The longer assignments usually combined multiple new concepts that we hadn't been tested on and if a student's basic knowledge of the concepts were not solid it would be very difficult to complete the longer assignment. Furthermore, even though the lectures were very well structured, I wish that we did more examples in class that combine multiple new concepts (like a longer assignment) so that it was easier to understand the \"big picture.\"\"",

Keeping awake in class was sometimes a problem. For the long assignments, don't trust the TA's. Communication is extremely poor.

            "review 1: \"11W with Frederic Leblond: This is a good intro course for engineers or anyone else interested in programming/computer science. The first 5-6 weeks are spent learning C, which can be frustrating and difficult at times because C is a pretty low level language. You need to learn a lot of syntax and techniques because you need to tell the computer to do just about anything you want it to. The last few weeks are spent learning Matlab. Matlab is much easier and quicker, because Matlab is a pretty high level language and will do a lot for you. The short assignments are pretty easy, and there is one due at the end of every lecture(not x-hours). They get increasingly harder as the year goes on though and near the end of C can be pretty difficult. The long assignments (there are four) cover a wider range of material and require a pretty significant time commitment. That being said, there are not a lot of curveballs and the material is all covered, it just takes a while to write all the code, put it together, and debug. There were office hours 6-8 M-Th. I went multiple times a week and they were very helpful. The TAs were great and were very helpful and knowledgable. Leblond is a very nice professor and very energetic and helpful. I do not think the course is exactly his area of expertise and he is new (to the school and the course), so he was a little rough on a few details (which annoyed some people), but he was very helpful in his office hours and very accommodating and understanding if anything came up. Great Prof. Great Course. It has made me very interested in computer science/computer engineering. Take this course.\""

The projects are connected to the real world and interesting and I genuinely enjoyed all the group work.

There were people of all majors that took it with me. The workload is pretty heavy for the first few weeks, but it gets a lot more manageable later on. None of the work is particularly difficult, but it can take a decent amount of time to get through. The class has a few HW assignments (basically problem sets you work on with a group), but most of the assignments are done in-class with other people. There's no midterms or final, but the main focus of the class is your term project. It seems pretty intimidating at first, but by the time you really start working on it, it's completely manageable and not that bad. Steve (he doesn't go by Professor Peterson) is a great guy, really friendly, and is always super available to help you out with the term project or the other assignments. Definitely make sure to meet with him as you're working on your term project. This class has a fair amount of work, but Steve is a generous grader so you won't do poorly unless you don't try at all. Overall, I looked forward to going to every class and, even though it was a 2A, it never felt like it dragged on (like some 2A's can) because each class was kind of like a workshop/work session on the assignments. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a TAS that's actually valuable or anyone that's interesting in solving any sorts of problems.\""

Professor Robbie seemed nice... but he never spoke. I actually don't know what purpose he served in the class, except grading midterms and papers. Professor Rosen was awful. He's a plastic surgeon, has a very high opinion of himself, and half of his lectures were 'witty' commentary on his personal achievements and escapades. He did two things well though: he is very well-connected, and brought in several important/interesting speakers. i was surprised to learn that he actually does some good in the world with his plastic surgeon skills... he doesn't just do boob jobs and face lifts, which you might expect from how he carries himself in class. He's done a lot of work in third-world countries providing cleft-lip/palate surgeries and he's working on something with the military now. the real problem that i had with this class, however, was its lack of structure. each class was given by two different guest lecturers so there was no continuity. and the wide range of issues discussed about health care often contradicted themselves... for example we had several fascinating lectures about providing health care to poor nations and uninsured americans, etc... and they might be followed by professor rosen flaunting this multi-billion dollar robotic thing that he thinks the military needs... it was very frustrating. the papers were not fun.... but looking back on them they really were not that hard. the group project at the end (in lieu of final) was interesting... both frustrating and rewarding. pretty easy overall. i did not enjoy this class... but did come out with a slightly better understanding of health care... sort of...\"",

It didn't really match it's official title or description; it was more about problems with the US health care system, then international solutions, and health care's relation to national security. It wasn't terribly technology heavy or technical. If you need to fill the distrib and have an interest in health care, this wouldn't be a bad class to take. The structure of the course is a bit unusual. Robbie and Rosen hardly ever lecture (Robbie gave one and Rosen a few). The bulk of the lectures are given by various experts and specialists, from doctors and surgeons to experts in national security. As might be expected, some of the lectures are excellent and some are quite boring. (Bonus: All lectures are filmed, so you can watch them online if you don't feel like going to class.) The structure of the class means that it seems somewhat fragmented and disconnected, although Rosen tried to frame each lecture within the context of the course in the last few weeks. The work itself is pretty painless. Two papers, two exams, and a few reading quizzes were the original requirements. We never ended up having to take a quiz, and there was the option of giving a group presentation for the final instead of an exam. None of the assignments were difficult if you went to most of the lectures and were familiar with the readings. I've never received so much (bad/useless) commentary on grammar and diction for my papers (I'm a humanities major who writes often), which is both amusing and somewhat insulting, although all the red ink didn't translate into a poor grade. As for readings, the two books are the only readings actually required (you don't need to read the 'required' articles assigned at the beginning of the course). Both books were very interesting, although very different. This class is good if you want a mildy interesting, relatively painless TAS that isn't very technical.\"",

If you have the option to go to dinner with him and the guest speaker, you definitely should. There was a short answer midterm exam and a multiple choice final exam which were both open book.

This course is basically all on virtual medicine or \u201cTelehealth\u201d and COVID, and honestly I was just bored after a while. Sometimes the lectures are interesting, but you need to really be passionate about the public policy side of healthcare for this class to be even remotely rewarding. The Midterm/Final was easy, and I wish we\u2019d just had those-they\u2019re fifty multiple choice questions about the lectures, which is weird, but manageable. The paper is actually terrible. Somehow it manages to be too long and too short at the same time. The topic they\u2019re asking you to cover-reforming an aspect of healthcare- is actually impossible to cover in depth, so you end up with this really weird condensed topic. The group project is very confusing, but ultimately fine as long as your group members put in decent effort. The biggest issue is that they save both major projects for the last two weeks of class. You have two weeks to complete the paper, which overlaps with when you need to start the project (which only gives you a week to begin with). The rubric for everything is pretty unclear, which makes everything really annoying. In total, the class was so much more of a time suck than I ever imagined. The speakers can be interesting, but with a few exceptions, I didn\u2019t find them groundbreaking. The only people I can see enjoying this class are people extremely interested in public policy. Do not take this class because the topic kind of piques your interest. I promise many things on campus will interest you that will be more rewarding.

For example, some lectures this term included: COVID-19 vaccines, telehealth and telemedicine, COVID-19 response in rural areas, the history of the US's health care system, etc. It can feel a little bit incohesive at times because nothing is centered around a specific topic, but that also means that most people will have something that they connect to and really care about. There is a 10-page paper, a midterm, a final project trying to create a new dual-use system, and possibly a final exam, with class two times a week for two hours each, an x-hour each week, and a discussion section once a week around 30 minutes long.

If not, it's certainly close and it is definitely the most logistically challenging because most projects are group projects, so you have to coordinate with your group all of the time. That being said, the workload actually lightens as the term goes on, which is a very nice trajectory. The rollercoaster project is fucked. We were up until 3AM making ours and then it didn't even work when we demo'd it. But by the end you become so much better at the process of brainstorming and BSing (crucial). So yes, this is a lot of time. However, the work is oftentimes super fun. Interviewing people can be fun and done at Foco casually. Meeting with the group is a great social break. Making videos, photoshopping, hot gluing foam core, and building stuff in general is all very fun work. You can do it for hours without getting bored or drained. The course is very different from a lot of Dartmouth courses because it is mostly group project based. This has pros and cons. Pro tip: after the first couple projects email Robbie asking if you can be put on a team with specific people. Or, you can do what I did and wait until before the final project and then play that card if you have friends in the class you haven't worked with yet. When I did that Robbie switched the teams around for me which was clutch because you work with your final project group for the longest and it is worth the most.

Additionally, the TAs are useful only when they help you technically, like building your roller coaster or helping with softwares, but their advices are not helpful because everyone disagrees with each other and Robbie actually said no to almost all of the TAs' advice for me. So if you have a question, go directly to Robbie. The experience of this class highly, if not all, depends on the randomly assigned teammates you get. If you get good ones, it's the best class you'll ever take at Dartmouth. If your teammates are terrible then your entire term will be a living hell.\"",
            "review 5: \"21F with Peter Robbie: For the first time basically ever, this class had an A- median in 21F. I think you could see it in Robbie's attitude. He picks favorites and is unpredictable in his grading. He and the TA's often frequently disagree which can make it tricky to apply feedback. I spent 15 hours a week on this class and met with my project groups nearly every day. It requires a lot of hours, even if the work isn't particularly difficult. That being said, it's a really nice break from the hyper academic style many other Dartmouth classes use. The class is well organized and the curriculum is clear and many of the assigned readings are super interesting. All the learning is hands-on and you literally never have to take notes unless you want to. You also get really close with the people in your class, which is fun. I would recommend this class, but I would recommend making an informed decision about it. Yes, you will probably get an A or an A-, but it's gonna take many many hours to get there. It'll be fun, but you will also sometimes be in Thayer at 1am on a Wednesday night trying to build a rollercoaster. So just think hard before you enroll!\"",

Everything you learn (and I mean every single thing) can be applied to whatever you decide to do with the rest of your life. It helps you gain a new perspective, one that is never prejudiced towards new suggestions and constantly looking for unrealized problems. Whether you are in STEM, humanities, or else, this course will prepare you for an innovative work environment. Yet, beware of the enormous workload that is waiting for you. If you are looking for a layup, this is not the way to go. The course is based on projects targeted towards specific design skills with the final one combining all, and each assignment requires continuous time commitment with checkpoints being uploaded. On top of all this, you will be expected to record your design findings and reading notes in a notebook. That being said, not a single work I have done for this class felt like a waste of time. Strongly recommended.\"",

If I had to title it, I would have said something along the lines of 'Entrepreneurship: Finding Needed Products.' The first two projects felt technical and design-like, which is why I took the class, but the rest seemed to be focused on finding what products people want (doing interviews, observing, writing), and at this point, everything started to get lost in abstraction. By the final project, I was so done with this course. Professor Robbie was one of the nicest profs I've had, but this course did not click with me. Don't let this discourage you though. I think many people really enjoy this class, and I wish I did as much as them.\"",

Over Zoom, the class was probably not quite as amazing, but I still found it worthwhile. There were six projects throughout the term and few breaks between them. Zoom made it fairly easy to collaborate with others on projects. We built rollercoasters out of foam core in our dorm rooms during quarantine. You could either pick supplies up from Thayer or receive a load of materials from Amazon away from campus. The lengthy weekly reading assignments were unnecessary and detached from the projects. The TAs were plentiful and very reachable over Slack. The two-hour classes felt particularly long over Zoom. Many x-hours were optional TA sessions. Professor Robbie and Eugene complement each other well and combined the two sections frequently in a single Zoom meeting. The professors are understanding of group dynamics and flaky project partners. The class is engaging even if you have no interest in engineering and/or the HCD minor. Some spots are reserved for first-years, so blitz the professors if you're interested and the course appears full.\"",

That being said, don't take it if you're the type of person who chronically relies on other people in your groups to handle the work... whether it's because you're lazy, or because you're afraid of messing something up. If it's the latter, it is ALWAYS BETTER TO AT LEAST TRY. If you freeload, you are NOT going to do well in this class: your individual grade for each project is adjusted based on your contributions. The profs figure out how much each person contributed to a project by asking everyone to write an evaluation after each one. In the evaluation, students are prompted to estimate \u2014 percentage by percentage \u2014 the amount of work each teammate put in; then, they'll list the things their teammates did to justify that percentage breakdown. People in this class are good and reasonable, in that they won't unfairly mark you down or anything. But they'll be honest about whether someone worked a lot more than the rest \u2014 or a lot less than the rest. This class really encourages everyone to put in their due diligence and work collaboratively as a team; I definitely had mostly good experiences with the group projects, and so did everyone else. But for the one bad experience I had... well, it was bad. Thankfully, Prof. Robbie was very empathetic about the whole thing when I spoke to him about it. So if you're having troubles with your group, I highly recommend speaking to your prof. They'll understand.\"",

Specifically you get good at working in groups with teammates who often don\u2019t agree with you and presenting your ideas effectively in presentations through many reps (6 projects). This class covers identifying problems users/customers face through interviewing and observing customers, creatively devising solutions, implementing prototypes and receiving user feedback. I suspect these skills are all very relevant to careers in product management and startups. Like everyone says, ENGS 12 is a ton of work. I think I put in 20+ hours per week on a few of the projects. The only class I put in more work for was COSC 65 Smartphone Programming with Prof. Andrew Campbell. The first ENGS 12 project was a bit dull - making creative variations of cut out shapes. But don\u2019t be phased - each project is more interesting and useful than the project before it.

I took this after an alumna suggested it over the summer and I'm so, so glad that I did. It was initially intimidating to be a younger kid in a class of juniors/seniors, but the collaborative nature of the course/the difficulty to actually get in made the class cohesive. I never would have set foot in Thayer/known about the Human Centered Design minor without this course.

Robbie is personable, down to earth, and excited about what he's teaching -- and always available in his office for a chat. But beware: this class will take over your life. I've never put more effort towards each percentage point of a grade for a class before. Weekly reading logs mean you actually have to do the reading (plus some independent reading on your own that you take notes on). Not to mention weekly or bi-weekly projects (mostly group projects) that will be a LOT of work. (But I think most of this is because people in the class put a lot of effort into the assignments because they want a great final product). Summary: Best class I've taken at dartmouth. EVERYONE should take this. Such an incredible experience -- and the skills you take from this class will serve you for a long time.

I also felt like this class pushed me to look for things in everyday life that could be redesigned and how to apply the design process to really anything - research for other classes, other projects, etc. As a prof, Eugene was great - engaging, relatable, although at times ironically seeming to care about how much sleep we were getting while assigning the projects that were the reason for the lack of sleep. Also very willing to talk with you outside of class about your life and if you have any questions about how to incorporate design into future careers, major, etc. This class was a ton of work but overall great experience!\"",

He made this course much better than it is - I'd definitely recommend being in Eugene's section if you are planning to take ENGS 12. The course itself is a huge time commitment \u2013 there is project after project without much of a break in between. Each project covers a different type of design (ex: graphic design, product design, etc.) and I found some to be really enjoyable, but others to not be worth all of the hassle. Because of the wide breadth of topics covered in this course, you do end up learning a lot of cool skills like Photoshop, prototyping, video editing, etc. Some of the TAs were honestly unhelpful and only pointed out things that were wrong/sucked or gave meaningless \"think outside the box!\" comments as suggestions, but then there were also amazing TAs who were super helpful whenever I was stuck on a project. I'd recommend going to TA office hours early on in the term to quickly figure out who's the most helpful/who you work well with. I also found the weekly reading logs to be the biggest unencessity in this course. Every week we were given a list of readings to complete and we had to write notes, scan it, and turn it in (and the TAs were unnecessarily strict in grading them). We're also expected to spend 2+ hours reading something of our own interest for these logs. While some of the readings were interesting, it was just unnecessary busy work that didn't really have much to do with the course. We never really talked about the readings during class or engaged with it beyond turning in the weekly logs for a grade.

Each project is engaging and focuses on improving a different skill or different set of skills. If you take this class to be prepared for some late nights: this class is a lot of hours, but fun hours. You are not reading from a textbook until 2 am. Instead, you are building prototypes or coming up with ideas. The things this class teaches you will permeate into other aspects of your life. I would recommend this class to everyone who is considering it!\"",
            "review 11: \"18F with Eugene Korsunskiy: This is possibly one of the best courses you can ever take at Dartmouth. Like most of the reviews state, the class is around 15-20 hours of work a week, excluding the readings you have to complete every week in the term. You are assigned six projects throughout the term, two of which are by yourself. Each project is meant to develop your skills at individual steps in the design process. You are graded primarily on how well you were able to execute the process rather than the final product. As long as you put in the effort, you will get an A. With that said, please do not take this course focusing on your grade but rather prioritize learning the material. You'll surely enjoy the course this way, especially with Eugene.\""

The rest of the course was on \"technological literacy,\" an idea that I still cannot define. We talked about many aspects of technology: the design process, engineering history, ethics, patents, and lasers. There were lots of lasers. Interesting conversations sometimes took place, but the course was still a waste of time. Professor Garmire was often patronizing and seldom proved more knowledgeable than the class. Although I liked her, she seemed to treat the class as inconsequential -- as a fun thing to do in her spare time. I expected more from Dartmouth, especially from a writing class. We spent only one class talking about writing, and instead of discussing style or rhetoric we just spent an hour debunking student writing. I don't mean to imply that analyzing student writing is not a valid way to learn -- it is one of the most useful tools available. But our time was spent combing through compositions and frivolously criticizing any aspect of language that someone didn't agree with. Instead of focusing learning revision and simplicity, we just lambasted anything we didn't particularly like -- regardless of its rhetorical validity. Professor Garmire's editing was similarly frivolous. Although many comments were helpful, she would often make needless, subjective changes. She suggested new words that changed or weakened what I meant to say. Once she encouraged us to be vague, because that way we \"couldn't be wrong.\" In one paper she made a big deal of using \"his or her,\" \"they\" and \"their\" instead of \"him\" \"he\" and \"his.\" Such politically correct suggestions do little to improve writing quality -- if anything, they further clutter my already long-winded sentences. Although she may hold a doctorate in physics, this does not necessarily imply any knowledge of writing. Not every scientist is Lewis Thomas. I believe the entire class was based on her amateur interest in \"Technological Literacy,\" and that her knowledge of writing is similarly amateur.

Outside of class she is very friendly, helful, well-read, and knowledgeable. She seems like she would be a very effective professor in any other course, but was just not well suited to teaching a first year seminar (which in my opinion is really an English class).

Professor Garmire does a good job of facilitating discussions in class, and the reading material she provides you with is interesting as long as you have even a tiny interest in the historical and social frames of engineering and invention. There are two large research papers (15-20), one small introductory paper, and another brief report on a design made in class. There are several reading assignments due with notes every meeting, but they aren't graded, so there isn't pressure if you were too busy to get the reading done the night before. The professor is interesting, but be prepared for a little bias. She has a tendency to develop favorites, and grades accordingly. She also has a slight tendency to favor girls, although that could have been just my class. The small setting of the class is perfect for intimate interaction with peers in discussion. Not only did I learn a lot about technology in this course, but I made several very good friends as well. Overall, I highly recommend this course if you have any interest at all in technology and engineering. You'll get to take several really really interesting tours of Thayer school (engineering labs) and Dartmouth (the steam tunnels! Yay!), and you'll take a lot of new understanding about the world with you when you leave. For the major and non-major alike, this is a good course to take.\""

The midterm was fair but definitely go to lectures as there are some pretty granular details on there. She ended up curving the grades up for the midterm. There is an in-class debate where you get a group grade, which is a hit or miss depending on how much your group actually cares.

The quality and complexity of these lectures varied even more widely than their topics - some seemed to be aimed at a general audience with no understanding, while others required a PhD-level understanding to even remotely comprehend; some lecturers were quite dull while others were extremely engaging. It is clear that Profs. Robbie and Rosen put a lot of effort into collecting all these speakers, though, and I think zoom is a particularly tough format for this kind of class. Work wise, there are a lot of hoops to jump through - weekly discussion group meetings, all class periods including all x-hours are used, two papers (5 and 10 pages), and two open-book exams (short essay for midterm and cumulative multiple choice for final). However, none of these were particularly difficult - the paper topics are quite broad and you have a lot of freedom to choose, while the exams were tailored to the non-STEM people in the class.

The downside: if you want a good grade, you need to put in quite a bit of work. The final grade consists of two research papers, two exams, and five random quizzes. The pop quizzes are the attendance points (they are very straightforward factual questions that you should get right if you attended class). The papers require more effort. They are less like essays and more like plugging in appropriate research and class material into a formulaic grading rubric. So, to get good scores in the papers, you need to pay attention in class and put in a lot of time into research, so that you have good material to use.

Also, some of the lectures are unbelievably boring, and there was tons of repetition in material; because the visiting lecturers were clearly not briefed on the fact that WE HAVE SEEN THE MOUSE W/ EAR PICTURE TEN TIMES ALREADY. the tests were incredibly easy - most people were leaving after 20 minutes to a half hour. the PAPERS - MY GOD. based on the rest of the course, i do NOT understand where they got the idea we'd be able to write those. now, granted, i didn't receive terrible grades on them, nor did other people I know, but finding the necessary research to back up your \"creative\" ideas as to how to improve human body function or how to cure some malady is incredibly painful. all you can think is \"i took this to get a TAS... now they want me to figure out how to cure cancer???\"\"",

            "review 16: \"06S with Peter Robbie: As others have said (read the \"Engs 5 = Waste of Life\" review; he/she summarized my complaints nicely), this is a GOD-AWFUL class that you should not take. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a TAS that looked any more interesting. The professors don't lecture, ever--it's all guest lecturers who begin to repeat each other by the second week. They all say the same things, with varying degrees of difficulty. Some of them thought they were lecturing to 2nd year med students, some of them apparently thought we were kindergarteners. They often go way over class time (like, 20 minutes over); the professors are passive as always and make no move to stop them. Professors Robbie and Rosen are the LAZIEST professors ever. I honestly have no idea how they're still \"teaching\" here. The TA's do everything. Yeah, they don't tell you until you're well into the class that the TA's--who are UNDERGRADUATES, NON-ENGINEERING MAJORS--will be grading your tests and PAPERS. Yes, that's right: undergraduates who have never taken an engineering class except this one will be GRADING your fifteen-page research papers. Doesn't that make you feel like you're getting your money's worth? The TA's vary in helpfulness and worth--mine was useless, others were more helpful. No matter what the profs tell you about the \"rubric\" the TA's use, paper grading is *extremely* subjective. Unless you like knocking yourself out on *ridiculous* paper assignments that you will be ashamed to turn in, and then having someone in your year or below grade it, don't take this class. Tests were multiple-choice, pretty easy if you studied hard. As someone else said, there were two types of questions: insultingly easy and obnoxiously detailed. And the tests are obviously written by the TA's as well: the questions are terribly written, full of grammatical and logic errors, and often completely irrelevant to anything. There was no continuity in the class as far as the lecturers: we had several lecturers discuss the EXACT SAME THINGS, same Powerpoint slides and everything, and then others who went on completely random, insane tangents about how no one's ever going to die. Fun stuff. Don't take this class, please. Remember how much money your parents pay, and how many good 2As are out there.\"",

There are two profs. Cushy deal, right? You're a prof, and you only have to lecture half the time. Wrong; if you're Robbie & Rosen (R&R), you hire a multitude of \"experts\" to do all your lecturing for you. This might be a good thing, because if your name is Dr. Joseph Rosen then you have a voice like William Shatner without the comedic sensibility (I find myself in physical pain listening to this man speak). However, the downside of this setup is that this class consists of two hours of powerpoints that are, in a word, \"worthless.\" Every single lecturer has shown the Exact. Same. Pictures. This class can be divided into two parts. The first part of the course should be entitled ENGS5: Mouse With An Ear On Its Back. The second half is ENGS5: Monkey With A Joystick. Someone should invent a mouse that can grow a monkey with a joystick on its back, so we can all save some time and get out early. Which brings me to my next point: that R&R are the most irresponsible professors I have ever encountered. When your guest lecturer is going TWENTY minutes over, you should have cut them off twenty minutes ago. People have places to be at 4. You can't expect people to stay past 3:51, and in a class of 200 students you just end up with a constant trickle of notebook shuffling and door slamming. Making students choose between courteously listening and making their appointments on time is disrespectful to both the speakers and the students. The profs need to grow spines (as if we didn't have enough lectures on neural regeneration) and tell their speakers when it's time to can it. So are you still tempted to take this course? I bet you heard it was easy, right? Well, test questions are divided into two types: 1) ridiculous, nitpicky details that no one could conceivably have remembered from that powerpoint that you were probably falling asleep during. 2) ridiculous, intelligence-insulting questions that make you wonder why you didn't just stay home and sleep in your own bed (\"A surgeon would choose to not operate on a damaged hand because; a) the patient would have more function with a **PROSTHESIS** dingdingding, b) she doesn't like hands, c) she didn't feel like doing surgery that day, or d) she slept in and missed the surgery\"). The essays are much harder, in the sense that no one could possibly write one that isn't a total piece of BS. You'll probably want to kill yourself for submitting something like that in an institution of higher learning. Everyone does about the same on the exams (with questions like that, there can't be much variability), but the essays are subjectively graded (I think about 30% of the people in class are TAs, so you should hope you don't get the one who just got dumped by someone with your name). ENGS5 might sound like a breeze, but there are actually far easier ways to get a T.A.S., that don't make you want to bludgeon yourself to death with a robotic arm. I've probably left off half of all my complaints with ENGS5, but at this point, I don't want to spend one more second of my life thinking about anything concerning this class.

Maybe part of the problem was our TA. He was supposed to schedule our presentations among other things, but he wasn't very responsive and there was never really a schedule. It always seemed like the TA didn't want to be there and it showed when you were trying to get in touch with him for help.

Taylor's lectures were less than inspiring and sometimes convoluted and misleading. to be fair, i don't get the impression that he has alot of teaching experience, and the wide range of abilities of the students probably didnt help him in preparing his lectures either (this might be rectified by a more clear definition of the material in the ORC). but at this point i'm not too gung ho about recommending him as a prof.\""

There's no processing in this class, which is what makes the class easy. The hard part is completing all of the work because it's tons and tons and tons of busy work. Lasky is not a very good lecturer and I've more than once wanted to fall asleep in this class, especially since most of the time, we just watched movies in class while filling out worksheets that come directly out of the video. Oh, I forgot to mention Lasky does take attendance. So no skipping class. The final and midterm paper are fairly easy, but in the end, the class is much more work than a regular class.

These questions were graded harshly, though. The homeworks took a long time to do, especially if you went to the TA help session. There were two \"papers\"; the first one was a 4 page paper written about a movie and the next was 4 questions about 2 movies. These were not hard.

Being a non-major, and just wanting this class as a TAS, and with no science/math background (only math course here was psych 10, last time i took physics was senior year in high school) those problems were really frustrating. Not to mention, he did not teach you the math in the lectures before or after the hw was assigned. You had to go to the TA sessions to figure out what you had to do for the math problems. Our TA was fantastic though! He listened to all of our complaints about the course, helped out with the math homeworks, and was great at explaining concepts to us. It's a lot of material and at the end of the course, you can make a cheat sheet for the final-- still it's a lot of information to cover.

They took off arbitrary points for anything, but these points could be argued back if you made time to go see another TA and explain why the points taken off homework was unfair.

If you enjoy spending 4 hours a week in class and at least 2-3 hours a week outside of class doing things utterly painful and completely pointless, then don't listen to what I have to say. Otherwise, read on. It wouldn't be so bad of a class if \"Dr. Ron\" were somehow engaging, made the lecture material somewhat interesting, or put a coherent curriculum together. Often spending the majority (1 to 1.5 hours) of a class period watching hokey and poorly produced Discovery videos - this does not constitute actual teaching (or learning) in my book. Load on \"Video Questions\", daily attendance (yes, even in a class of 200+; they're engineers), weekly readings in a psuedo-scientific joke of a textbook, and weekly homeworks to hand in (that take a lot of effort to do yet require no actual thought at all), and you've got yourself here a class that harkens back to 7th grade middle school. Thank goodness for wireless in the classroom. When we were not watching movies, I spaced out and did work for other classes, or read books and journal articles that actually were a productive use of my time. That's how I \"contributed to my own learning experience\" as it asks on Bannerstudent. I did not let forced attendance + poor teaching become a complete waste of time (as much as I could). As for Lasky overall, at least in a class of >200, he tried to get to know his students by taking them out to lunch. That was good. But, sometimes I doubted whether or not he knew the material either. To sum up Dr. \"Ron\" would be to say that he had the unique ability of being able to say a lot without saying much at all. (hah) He self-called way too often and was oblivious to a couple things: (1) not everyone is as rich as or will be as rich as Dr. Ron, and (2) not everyone intends to be come a PhD and/or make loads of money. It became a running joke between several students to tally how many times each class we would hear about how many houses Dr. Ron owned or how much money he made or hear him say \"when you're all engineers and making $1 million per year, you'll.....blah blah blah\". In the right circumstances, might have been a great drinking game. The TAs were the only saving grace in the course.

He actively tried getting dinner with the entire class (the dinners are paid for by the Thayer Engineering School) and you should try to grab a meal with him during the term, or even after it. He begins his lectures by giving us five statements on history (or anything generally unrelated to materials) and asking us which one is false. He gave candy bars to students who found typographical errors on his slides, and made these great name tags for all of us to use. Whether you\u2019re shy or a talkative bore, you will enjoy this class immensely. The only small word of caution goes to those who dislike busy work. This class is full of it, and every single weekly homework assignment, while super easy, could take about ten to twenty hours each. Working on Times New Roman 12 Point and double spacing on a 1-inch-margin-on-all-sides paper, expect to turn in 15-25 page assignments. Most of these are questions from videos viewed in class, so note-taking is mandatory because the answers are usually tidbits on the film that require your attention (i.e., [According to the video] when were women allowed to vote in Utah?). The midterm was a tricky wicket with True/False and Essay sections, and you really need a strong grasp of the materials to do well. But then again, according to him, the lowest grade on that midterm exam was a B minus. You would have to be a big time slacker to mess up on it. You are only allowed one free absence from this 10A, so use it wisely. You have the choice of a final paper or a ten-minute presentation, but I didn\u2019t mind doing both just to make sure I\u2019d be on a safe cushion for this class. Remember that this class is technically a TAS but it is about the history of man\u2019s use of materials, so there\u2019s a great deal of leeway for your final project. As a matter of fact, my paper and presentation were surveys on Korean technological accomplishments from 550 to 1550. Just watch out: Dr. Lasky probably knows that his class is a total gut and so will probably try to make it harder...but that\u2019s just a thought.\""

However, as the term progressed it because clear that the course is a survey for every topic ever in engineering, which, if you don't know anything about the subject or you're an arts-inclined person like me, is more than disconcerting. Gibson breezes over complicated topics that you'll later spend hours trying to understand, and maybe one of them will be on the test. I don't know how people in the class did well on the tests, I studied harder than in any other class and still the concepts eluded me. It was very frustrating to not get the grade I deserved based on my effort just because I'm not physics/engines inclined. With that said, the final project (although a hugggge amount of work) is constructed so that you can choose something you're interested in and that's at your level, which I guess is good.

There were weekly quizzes, most of which are very straight forward and really just memorization tests. The culminating portion of the class is a final build or deconstruction. This was the most frustrating portion of the class. Especially because my group did a build. First, we had to submit a proposal the day after winter carnival. Also, I was under the impression that the TAs would be a useful resource for us in case we hit an snags in our build, but I was greatly mistaken. When we asked for help, the most help we ever got was one of the TAs smashing apart one of our circuit boards in an attempt to show us an computing device.

Even her PowerPoint slides were often pretty silly, with random pictures of everything from Underdog, a Monty Python toy catapult launcher, and a \"chick magnet\", which all related somehow to the topic at hand. At the beginning of each class, she would ask a random trivia question, and play a portion of some random song and ask a person to guess what the name was - just for the heck of it. That said, going into this class, I had no idea how much physics would be a part of it. I absolutely hated physics in high school, but nearly the entire first half of the course was physics without math - so if you don't like physics, keep this in mind before signing up for the course. However, the second half of the course was significantly more interesting to me - we learned about electricity, magnetism, computers, CDs, and a lot more present-day, \"real world\" types of technology. I found the two midterms to be rather unpredictable and frustrating. Going into the two midterms, I felt like I had no idea what was going to be on either one - we had a ton of PowerPoint slides without any real organization as to the different topics or important key points we had to know - so studying was a real pain because you had no true direction or focus as to what to review.

While there were a few \"how things work\" examples thrown in the course, I had expected more practical applications and less basic physics, which I think most students also wanted to avoid. In contrast, the electronics portion of the class was interesting and I learned a lot, probably since I'd had no prior exposure. As for the weekly quizzes, much was taken straight from the readings from the textbook which were pretty boring and badly written. I wish I enjoyed this class more than I did. If you don't need the requirement, I would say skip it and just read articles on HowStuffWorks.com.\"",
            "review 9: \"06W with Ursula J.: this was a good class. interesting. VERY nice professor. you get to choose what you study. paper/quizzes/presentation. if you can make her laugh on the quizzes you get extra points. fairly easy class. readings were very accessible. take it. why not?\"",
            "review 10: \"06W with Ursula J.: So the textbook is the Way Things Work -- with animals interacting with technology -- so easy and funny to read! though you definitely don't have to read it. the tests are just class notes. The end of the term is pretty serious with a very serious lab presentation and quite a research paper (if you care about the subject). I, a girl who knew nothing about technology and the way things worked, learned how things work.\"",
            "review 11: \"04W with Ursula J.: this class was not for those who just need the distribs- there is an final extra project which took up way too much time and was taken way too seriously. the tests were ridiculous and you need to teach yourself a lot of the material.\"",
            "review 12: \"04W with Ursula J.: I'm a govy major. This was the easiest lab imaginable. One time we had to take a apart a mechanical pencil. That's how easy it is. BUT make sure you get competent lab partners, otherwise your life will be a living hell. My lab partners were a sarcastic SAE and the editor of the Dartmouth Review, so it was very entertaining. Gibson has a great sense of humor and, I have heard from some majors, is the best teacher in the Engines department. The bad part about this class is the workload towards the end. There is a final exam, a final research paper, AND a final lab grou presentation. None were difficult. All were time consuming. This class was full of slackers, so if you have at least reasonable study habits you should get an A. Unless you just totally suck at basic physics.\"",
            "review 13: \"03S with Ursula J.: A very interesting class, Prof. Gibson obviously enjoys teaching it and it provides excellent knowledge for those obscure trivia questions.\"",
            "review 14: \"03S with Ursula J.: This course is really nothing like the course description. Basically, its a physics course without math. There is 1 big project where you investigate a piece of technology of your choice. Lab is kind of ridiculous and pointless and basically a waste of time. For example, we had to disect a camera and make exact sketches of each single part in the camera... Gibson is available during office hours but dont expect her to be better at explaining concepts. She just understands things at such an advanced level its hard for her to make stuff more simple...\"",
            "review 15: \"03S with Ursula J.: While the class was somewhat more difficult than I had expected, I overall enjoyed it. I thought that the professor at times made leaps that left a non-science person such as myself rather baffled, her lectures did help me understand how a lot of things work. And I particularly enjoyed the final project, where a freedom of topic selection let me explore something I was really interested in. The result was a class that consumed my term more than I had hoped it would, but which was nonetheless a positive academic experience.\""
