I put a ton of work into this class and got a ton out of it but it does not have to be a super hard course. Professor Mikecz is a wonderful teacher who is really passionate about what he teaches. He is also super nice, approachable, and goes out of his way to help students. He often searched through his old records to send me stuff I needed for my research, digitized stuff I wanted to read and could not find online, and helped me search and translate Spanish documents for information relevant to my research. Sometimes we also had fascinating discussions about stuff unrelated to the class that ended up tieing into the themes of indigenous Peruvian history in unexpected ways.

My only problem with the class was that, for very understandable reasons, more often than not the readings explored an issue up until the late 1980s or early 1990s, and rarely focused on exactly where they are today.

The readings varied from excruciatingly dull to engaging, and also from autobiographical to 'pseudo' as well as spanning several centuries and styles. There was too much reading for the time and the number of books required entailed considerable expense. In terms of assignments, I never knew how I was doing grade wise as nothing was ever returned.

Furthermore, a lot of times she would just go on lecturing and not give anyone a chance to add input. The class was highly disorganized, with readings sometimes posted the night before a class. Not only that, but readings were often 100-200 pages for a class. The final exam was tedious and expected you to remember random facts, which is not what I got out of the course. The final essay was completely different than what she told us it would be and she gave out the prompt much later than promised, but it was still pretty open-ended. I did like the two essays because you did have some freedom to write about what you wanted to. Overall, I am glad that I did take this class. I enjoyed most of the readings, especially those in the second half of the course, and do feel like my worldview has expanded. I would recommend this class to prospective NAS majors and anyone else who may be interested in how we view people, but I would not recommend it as a layup.\"",
            "review 3: \"21F with Vera Palmer: This class is less of a layup than it seems. Palmer has a philosophy background so you just end up reading a ton of dense philosophy papers from Hegel, Locke, Foucault and others that don't really directly relate to the content of the class. Assignments include a ton of readings per day, random reading checks, a midterm paper, final paper and an in person final exam that reminds you of those super unnecessarily detail-oriented high school English tests about quotes, who said what, matching, vocab definitions and more. Prof is nice if you take the class meet her outside of the classroom you'll like her more but in class she talks every day without any discussion at all which is super dry and boring. Honestly, not the worst class but definitely not what the rest of the reviews made it seem to be.\"",
            "review 4: \"19S with Vera Palmer: This class was kind of a mess, but it was not anyone's faults (I mean this, Vera could not have prevented this). It could be a lot of work. It seemed like it would be, but like I said this class was a mess so we never really got assigned anything.\"",
            "review 5: \"19S with Vera Palmer: Great Class. Highly recommend, especially if your planning on an nas major/minor. Workload manageable, with readings every class and, on occasion, a quiz. Palmer is one of the nicest professors at Dartmouth and will help you if you reach out. Interesting course material as well.\"",
            "review 6: \"19F with Vera Palmer: An overall really interesting class. Professor Palmer insists on class participation, but the same few people would answer questions every time. 1 midterm paper, an in-class final, and 1 final paper along with a pop quiz. We never got any assignments back from Professor Palmer and she was sometimes unclear about deadlines/assignments in general. Perhaps not the most organized class but worth taking and an easy class if you do the readings and participate a bit.\"",
            "review 7: \"18F with Vera Palmer: I cannot say enough how much I really enjoyed this course. Professor Palmer is lovely and really cares about her course. If you take the time to get to know her and really absorb the material, you will definitely get a lot out of the class (and likely do well in terms of grading too). This course focuses on comparing and contrasting the philosophies of Indigenous communities and traditional western philosophers. Highly recommend the course and making the effort to form a relationship with Professor Palmer.\"",
            "review 8: \"17F with Vera Palmer: Palmer is the most enthusiastic lecturer and super into the topic. I went in with no prior knowledge and found it interesting/did well. Kinda a lot of reading but if you go to class and participate you don't really have to do it all. Assignments were relatively short essays - if you write well and show interest in the topic you'll do fine\"",
            "review 9: \"15F with Vera Palmer: Very chill, Palmer is the best and we wrote 2 papers (midterm and final) and had a final exam. Other than that we had 1 quiz and a few 1 page responses. Warning there is a lot of philosophy but other than that great class!\"",
            "review 10: \"13S with Vera Palmer: Course: I have to admit I took this class because of two main reasons: I had heard it was a relatively easy class and I had promised myself I would take a NAS class before graduating, since this is Dartmouth after all. I was pleasantly surprised. The lectures were engaging and even spiritually inspiring at times (props to Professor Palmer) and the readings were a diverse mix of French/German philosophy and Native literature. I never felt a single class was boring or useless. Professor: Vera Palmer is a star. She really is. Although she does use a tad too many vocabulary words that may sound pretentious at times, she is a woman of real soul. Every time I stayed after to chat with her a bit, she was willing to listen to what I had to say with unfeigned interest (at least she made it seem so). She is one prof I will keep in contact with for the rest of my time at Dartmouth (and hopefully beyond). She sang the part of Madame Butterfly in a theatre production once. 'Nuff said. Workload: The workload is only three essays (the midterm and final ones included in these three) and then readings for every class. The readings are sometimes ginormous, but most of them need only practiced skimming to be able to participate in class. I would recommend however, really reading deeply into Foucault and Hegel. They will come back to haunt you in the final if you don't.\"",
            "review 11: \"08F with Vera Palmer: This class was very interesting. There was a lot of reading but it was discussed well in class. The exams were pretty laid back. Vera is very helpful and nice.\"",

            "review 13: \"07W with Vera Palmer: The class wasn't what I was expecting at first-- we were reading Locke, Hobbes, Foucault, etc. I didn't like it for the first weeks, but then everything started to come together. It ended up being the best class of my freshman year.\"",
            "review 14: \"07F with Vera Palmer: Some parts of the course are very interesting and thought provoking, and others are pretty boring. While day to day class was pretty slow, I took this course because I wanted to take a least one Native American course and not have to work very hard and both were accomplished. I would suggest taking this class if you need a third class or want a NAS class. And Professor Palmer is very nice and understanding. If you show her you're working hard for her, you will get a good grade.\"",
            "review 15: \"07F with Vera Palmer: I thought this was a good overview course. I think Palmer was a bit overwhelmed with the number of people that enrolled but overall she gave good lectures. The class wasn't difficult but generally wasn't boring either. Take if you're interested in NAS and want a general overview of the subject.\"",
            "review 16: \"07F with Vera Palmer: This was the best class that I've ever taken. I've taken a lot of interesting courses before, but this one was better than them all. It really opens your eyes to new perspectives and helps you to be more open-minded. You learn a lot about the perspectives of Native Americans in this class, but what you learn in this class can be applied to people of all racial groups. Professor Palmer is a great lecturer and it's always enjoyable to go to class. You can tell she is very passionate about the class and really wants you to learn and understand the material. There is a lot of reading, but the reading is very interesting. In all, it's an awesome class and everyone should take it.\""

There is very rarely anything discussed in class that you'll later regret you missed -- the only graded projects are papers, and you can focus on one of the dozens of specific aspects discussed in class. On the other hand, class can be interesting as an overview of Native cultures. This is a very anthropological class, and some of the texts deal almost exclusively with the traditions and customs of each tribe. You pretty much have free rein to take the papers where you want to go with them, and there isn't much of a way to screw that up. There is reading every night, and Prof. Runnels always has us turn in a 1-page \"response paper\" to the reading. This can get tedious, especially late at night, and it might turn some people off.\"",

I know that the best way to improve your writing is to write everyday, but the 1-2 page responses we had to write every night got very tedious after a while. The autobiographies we read were very interesting however, and it was a nice opportunity to read books I otherwise would not have read. Runnels is a very interesting and approachable guy, and was very helpful concerning the final research paper.\"",
            "review 5: \"04F with Dennis M.: The Course: Based on Native American Autobiographies, the course goes far beyond the topic to encompass Native American history and governmental relations. A great intro to Native American Studies, either for a major or for general knowledge. The readings are mostly interesting, and the papers are relatively easy. Lots of writing for this course, but classes themselves are pretty low key. Lots of movies. The Prof.: Professor Runnels is a softspoken Salish Indian with a lot to teach. It was great to take this course with him. Watching documentaries and having your teacher recognize the people in them as neighbors and friends is an amazing experience. Professor Runnels teaches Spanish and Literature at Dartmouth, but if you want to see him in his element, take a NAS class with him. Pretty easy grader and a really nice guy.\"",
            "review 6: \"04F with Dennis M.: Prof. Runnels is an interesting dude. From the content of his lectures, where he often veered off into other topics, that became apparent. He has an incredible wealth of knowledge on so many different aspects of Native American history or current sociopolitical conditions, and even his own life story is quite compelling. However, he talked about these things probably as often as he did about the assigned readings, and once he starts talking, you don't really get a chance to respond to anything. As a disclaimer, Runnels was undergoing chemo while he taught, which is pretty ballsy, and explained a good deal of his scatter-brained and tangential rambling. However, there is still a massive amount of reading and writing in this class, one that was pretty difficult to keep up with. And while I probably will take another NAS class, it probably won't be anything literature related.\"",

Runnels is a nice man with a genuine interest in the subject material, but I can't connect all I learned about Native Americans/their struggle with any viable major. This is one of those liberal arts-type classes... but as a seminar, that was just fine for me. No exams, just a final paper that you have (almost) complete freedom of topic. Would recommend... but not if you can't stomach a rather quaint course.\"",

I also feel that I didn't improve my writing as much as I could have. If you want a fairly easy, laid-back seminar or if you are very interested in Native American culture, you might like this. However, I think there are much better freshman seminars than this one offered at Dartmouth!\"",
            "review 13: \"02F with Dennis M.: I chose this course in haste, and regret doing so. Whereas most of my friends were discovering fields in which they had interest, and concepts which they'd never heard before, I was reading dull autobiographies. Yes - the books are dull, and the papers seem generated on a whim - they are contrived and VERY uninteresting, except for the final 15 pager, which is an open topic. Overall, the class is dead easy, which is bad - especially for a seminar. Professor Runnels is an nice, interesting man with a colored past, but that doesn't necessarily make him a great teacher. He spends a lot of class time talking about his past and Indians, and leaves little to discussion. Often, he is incoherent, and seems unprepared for class. Somehow, there was something grossly out of proportion in that this class on Indian Identity and spirituality and lifestyle was confined to a certain hour and plastic grey, classroom thrice a week in a very Western school. Things did not flow well, and so felt superficial. I feel that it was half-assed, and not by anybody's fault really; it just ended up that way. The pace was such that it would've taken a year for the material to settle, and I felt sorry for Runnels a lot, because I knew that that's the way he'd rather have it, too. If you are deeply interested in NAS, or cultural anthropology, go for it. If you are not, read some books on Indians, talk to some, or go work on or near a reservation. Your understanding of the course's title - Indian Identity will be much deeper. You only get one seminar, and I know that I could've learned a lot more last term than I did.\"",
            "review 14: \"02F with Dennis M.: This originally was not on my list of seminar choices, but through a strange set of circumstances I ended up in it. I don't regret it either, for it was a very enlightening class and gave me a lot of knowledge of what Native Americans have gone through and where they stand today. This is a subject largely ignored and this class shed some much needed light on it for me. Professor Runnels is very knowledgable, and he tends to talk a lot, even if it is off subject, which I really liked since he has plenty of good info to share. He can be a pretty hard grader, but don't let that deter you because he is a good professor and will teach you a lot if you are interested. I would recommend this class.\"",
            "review 15: \"01F with Dennis M.: When I took this class, there were only five of us, and so it was a very personal experience. Unfortunately, with so few people we couldn't really have any extensive debates on the material from the readings, which was very interesting, and so much of the class consisted of Professor Runnels talking about his own knowledge of the topics at hand as well as his own experience, which was all right with me since I thought what he had to say was always very interesting (if more than occasionally rather tangential to what we had been talking about) and inspired interest in Native American studies. All-in-all, an excellent class for a general overview of Native American Studies, since through the autobiographies you get to see history, culture, the forces of assimilation, religion, and politics on a broad scale that just begs for further studies.\"",
            "review 16: \"01F with Dennis M.: the course wasn't exactly like its description, but it was still really interesting. i learned so much about the various aspects of native american culture and history. you don't have to like history to enjoy this class. i would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about the native americans and, obviously, to anyone who likes reading autobiographies. professor runnels identifies himself as a nez perce indian, knows the language, and clearly knows the history and culture of many native american tribes. he's very interesting to listen to, but the only bad thing is that he's like a freight-train when he gets to talking--once he gets going, you can't really get a word in edgewise. my class only had 5 people in it... so if you're shy about being on the spot or having to express your opinion, you might think twice about taking this class. i found it to be really interesting. the only bad thing is that no matter how hard i work on my papers, i only got Bs. that's not a bad grade, it just seemed like an astronomical amount of work only got me a B+ instead of a B. professor runnels has very high standards.\""
