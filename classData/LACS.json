Don't get me wrong, the topics were enjoyable considering that we had to watch films and write short summaries of scenes and musical numbers about them. However, with the absence of rubrics and reasonable grading, I would not recommend this class if you are attempting to improve your writing tremendously. I found my Writing 5 course more helpful since that professor did provide a lot of feedback, rubrics, outlined clear expectations, and appreciated what everyone brought to the class from the beginning of the term. The professor for this writing seminar is a nice person, but she never explicitly talked about her expectations and grades way too harshly. She focuses more on grammatical errors rather than the content and analysis.

You may get your paper back with no writing at all except page after page of \"+\" next to certain paragraphs, only when you get to the end of the paper, you receive a grade of \"B.\" If he was going to grade like that, at least substantiate why a B was given! Even though this was a course on Chicano autobiographies, he barely talked about the literary features of the books. Instead, everything was a discussion about contemporary topics like bilingual education, affirmative action. For 2 weeks, all we did was talk about affirmative action and the pros and cons of it. Runnels is clueless about Dartmouth. In our discussion of Affirmative Action, SAT scores came up. Runnels claimed that \"the average SAT score at Dartmouth is a 1200.\" I'm not lying about this! Plus, he also talked about how people who scored 1600's on their SAT's weren't really that impressive when he had those students in his class, and that recruited student athletes were some of the best students he's ever had. Then he proceeded to get a tally of the number of students who scored 1500s, 1400s, etc. in the class. Runnels fills his discussions with politically incorrect statements. When referring to Asians and their high scores on the SAT's, he called them \"Orientals.\" Also, when talking about remote possibility of legalizing illegal Mexican immigrants in a Congress Bill, he said that \"there's not a Chinaman's chance of it passing.\" Runnels is the worst professor at Dartmouth, even worse than Shelby Grantham.

            "review 1: \"09W with Julie Lirot: I think this seminar will be different the next time it is taught. However, there are some things I feel like I need to point out. First of all, the class is not what it sounds like in its description--it is not at all focused on the history of Latin American revolutions. You don't read historical essays or documents relating to the revolutions. You don't even really discuss the revolutions in depth or see different points of view on the revolutions. Instead, the class focuses on novels and plays that are somehow related to revolutions in Latin American countries. The four books we read were \"Death and the Maiden,\" by Dorfman, \"In the Time of the Butterflies,\" by Alvarez, \"Before Night Falls,\" by Arenas, and \"Leopard in the Sun,\" by Restrepo. These works may have been interesting for some, but personally I did not think very highly of them, with the exception of Death and the Maiden. There was nothing significant about \"Butterflies\" and \"Leopard.\" \"Before Night Falls\" is a very interesting book that certainly opens your mind a little bit, but it is a very, very, very sexual book which can be hard to read sometimes. The professor is nice and available to meet outside of class, but she expects too much of the class. The work load was pretty ridiculous, and it was confusing--I found myself frequently not knowing when things were due, not only because we had so many different assignments simultaneously, but also because the professor simply could not clearly explain when our assignments were due. Overall, this was like a high school English class. To be fair, this was the professor's first time teaching a seminar, and I am almost certain she is going to make changes for next time.\"",
            "review 2: \"09W with Julie Lirot: The response papers that went along with each reading assignment were kind of a pain, but they definitely helped me analyze each book in smaller parts. I also developed most of my ideas for papers from my response papers and my classmates' response papers. Writing a response made it a lot easier to discuss the books in class because we already had points and observations prepared. Professor Lirot is very helpful when it comes to writing papers. For every paper, we handed in a first draft and then had individual conferences with her to discuss changes. This method definitely helped me improve my final drafts of each paper. The workload that she assigned was definitely heavy, but it was doable and I feel like I learned a lot because of it. At first, Professor Lirot seemed like a very tough grader, but the key to doing well in her class is simple: if she sees that you are making a serious effort, your grade will reflect that.\""

I liked how prof voekel just let them play out naturally and didn't try to impose a strict plan for the discussion. It was the first online class that I've had that had an organic feel to it. i think it takes a special skill set to be able to facilitate discussions like that and essentially lecture on the fly to some extent, and she killed it.\"",

There is a lot of cool, interesting reading to learn about though if you\u2019re not, although it does tend to focus on the imperialism and colonial warfare a bit.

There are a lot of readings and you read about 5 books in 6 weeks or so which can be daunting but she doesn't test on minute book content, it's very much overview of the book supplemented by other readings. There are no tests, just three papers and a few one question quizzes. This class is hard to do poorly in. Read the material, participate in class and get to know Voekel.

I really enjoyed what I learnt. Her canvas page was also super easy to navigate and super organized. It was easy to find any reading we needed (which was super useful for when we wrote papers). It's also a very much an intro class, where you jump around topics quite fast, or as Prof. Baldez called it, a \"tapas course.\" And she even left the last week of the term blank in the syllabus so that we could use it to delve into current events in Latin America. We were expected to read a moderate amount of material before class, and then were expected to do group activities and discussions pertaining to those readings. She rarely lectured during our zoom meetings, and instead lectured in pre-recorded videos that we were to watch before class. We wrote two major papers, with a bunch of short essays and discussion posts and other sorts of activities sprinkled throughout the term. She also focused a lot on familiarizing students with academic writing in history and political science. My only complaint is that I felt like her writing expectations felt a bit unclear to me, and her essay prompts could feel convoluted. Also, as a STEM major, I found it a bit hard to keep up with all the work. However, this is one of those classes where you'll get a good grade if you genuinely put in the work and participate in class. She even hosts x-hour classes for students to go up and ask questions about the upcoming papers and clarify what she wants. I would fully recommend this class to anyone interested in Latin America and how the past influences the present of the region.\"",

Though it was tough to get through the background information in the first week or so, the rest of the class was incredibly interesting and a great introduction to important topics in history, political science, and gender studies. Professor: Professor Baldez is my new favorite professor, hands down. I came to the first day of LACS 001 simply shopping for courses. I had not planned on taking this course, but was instantly won over by Professor Baldez's enthusiasm and approachability. Professor Baldez is fair, understanding, and will give you feedback on your work along the way. Additionally, she has a great sense of humor, which really added to the lectures. I recommend taking this course early in your Dartmouth career, as it is a fantastic introduction to Latino & Caribbean Studies and an even better avenue to meeting one of the most genuinely kind and fascinating people you will encounter in your life. A++ Workload: The workload was perfect for first-year students. The course work was evenly paced, with a midterm, final, two take-home papers (5-7 pages), and two film reviews (2-4 pages).

It was almost like there were thirty dying cats under the seats. While the in class midterm was graded a little tougher than I would have thought, Professor Watanabe provides more than adequate feedback to justify the grade. The midterm essay, on the contrary, was graded by professor Navarro and not returned until the FINAL DAY of class. It seemed as if she was finishing her grading IN THAT CLASS as well. She provides no justification for anything and scribbles a question mark here and a snide comment there hoping that a few pen marks would make it seem like she did something. Her lectures are disorganized and most times she contradicts herself frequently. Her inability to present the information makes it impossible to pay attention from fear of becoming frustrated. One more downside to this course is the amount of material presented in such a short period of time. If you decide to take this course, GOOD LUCK!\""
