We also didn't get feedback on our papers (some people got one of theirs back), and the course grade was essentially just three papers and quizzes, so there wasn't really much we could take away from the course aside from what we learned on our own from readings and lecture videos. I recommend taking this course when it's offered again in-person as the material covered is interesting and Kraemer is a great prof, but he just had difficulty adapting the course to the online format and dealing with everything else going on in his life.

Sometimes there's so much text that you don't know what to copy down and other times when there are actually important graphs/images/charts to understand, there is ZERO text/analysis. I often found myself wondering \"what are we supposed to know about this slide??\" when I was studying for the midterm and final.

Kraemer had assigned two presentations to do with a partner over research that you should be researching for your research paper, also due the week of finals, which, oh yeah, there was a final that finals week, too. The last two weeks of the term were jam-packed, but if you start studying for the final early, you'll be fine. you're not going to do that though bc who really does? lectures were great in the front half of the term, not as good the second half, and the vibe of the class for the term was slightly awkward the entire time. felt like a layup work-wise, but we'll see grade-wise.\""

Petitto seems to think that we cannot understand the simplist of concepts, and she continuously drops her own name during lectures and on slides (its a little weird because she's so nice yet comes across as so self-congratulatory when she does this). So now you're thinking, \"Great. An easy A.\" Nope. Petitto's midterm was incredibly unfair. She gives you the questions beforehand, but looks for extremely specific components in your answers - things which don't necessarily seem relevant to the question at all. Leave one or two things out, and you're down to a B+ or B. This is only annoying because the material is so easy, and you feel like you should have gotten an A+. I have heard that the reason for this obscure grading is that Professor Petitto tried to make the course harder when she heard that people thought it was easy. Well, now the course is still painfully easy, but the tests are unfair. Petitto's main goal in this course is to try and teach you a few key facts that you'll remember for the rest of your life. I understand that she really wants to drive those points home. The problem is that I learned NOTHING else, and spending ten weeks learning that monkeys don't have Language, bilingual babies aren't confused, and that we're all hard-wired to pick up language patterns is a waste of time. Only take this course if you have to because you'll be really bored. From what I learned in this course, I just don't get the sense that language acquisition deserves a whole course.

She provides NO guidance, NO help, going to her office hours is purely frustrating because she doesn't provide any teaching. She merely sits and frowns at you. Overall, I almost quit this class and gave up my minor because it was such a horrific experience and I know many people in my class considered doing the same thing. You don't learn anything and what you do learn you teach yourself. I've never been so disappointed by a class in my life. Unfortunately, if you're a minor, this is mandatory hell you have to go through. Hopefully she'll lose this class before you have to take it.\"",
            "review 2: \"09W with Donna Coch: Prof Coch delivers. She is organized, systematic, and makes sure you learn what you need to learn. Unlike most profs at Dartmouth, lecture in her class isn't about a meandering journey through a subject, it is structured around the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, goes through each of its categories using the same framework, and provides you with the special ed background you'll need to be a classroom teacher. There are 4 short research papers that may help you learn to evaluate education research findings and how to apply them to teaching, but I didn't learn much content from them. Be careful because Prof Coch is suuuper picky about APA citations, tardiness, grammar, etc. And maaad obsessed with attendance. And she uses almost every x-hour to show irritating movies about complaining parents. I'm not so interested in the subject so I'm trying to be fair here, but this class wasn't for me. It was much better than I thought. If the subject is your thing you can probably stomach the boring papers and irritating movies because Prof Coch is a good teacher and you'll learn a ton from lecture.\"",
            "review 3: \"08S with Donna Coch: The seminar (this term at least, it may change) met weekly for three hours. The main part of the course was each student teaching one class, giving an oral presentation about a specific topic. There is a ton of reading for each class meeting, some of it helpful, some of it repetitive, and you have to do a research proposal (anywhere from twenty to forty pages plus) for the final class meeting. The proposal is based off of your oral presentation, which is based upon your week's topic in education. There is a clear bias for making education more science-based (neuroscience and psychology) over the more traditional educational perspective, although all perspectives are recognized to some degree. If you are a teacher, do not assume you will like the minor because it tends to be heavy on the science. The psychology majors in the course seemed to do very well. Professor Coch is extremely organized, and has extremely high expectations, even if they are not always clear. She is great about helping outside of class, so take advantage of that! Overall, not too bad, but the class is way too long and the proposal is painful to write. Try not to put it off!\"",

Also, the idea of tying together brain & education is novel, but as the course goes on you get the feeling that the professor tries too hard to link brain & education. I liked this better than the other education courses I have taken, mainly because this wasn't a \"we'll sit around a table discussing our personal experiences and in return i'll dole out A's and A-'s\" course and actually challenged me to some extent. The whole exercise of writing a \"quality research proposal\" was rather useless though, and her expectations are always vague/ambiguous to say the least. Not the best, and not the worst class I've taken either. The work doesn't really seem worth all the trouble though. Just remember that what you see on the syllabus is what you get.\""

Although the neuroscience part of the course was completely new and interesting, I criticize the course for being unbalanced. There was not enough focus on the nurture (of the nature vs. nurture debate). They say it is a blend of the two and try to make connections between them, but I found this course to be heavily focused on the brain. The readings were almost exclusively neuroscience/neuroimaging studies. By the end of the term, the lack of creativity and monotony of reading Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion...got to my motivation. Presenting the neuroscience side of things is good, but this course is a bit of an overdose, especially for those of us seniors who are all new to this turn in the department.\"",

Super interesting material though and I learned a lot about a field I'm interested in but the course design made it a miserable experience overall.

Imo, Prof Coch has designed the course well, with the best use of Canvas modules I have ever seen. The topics (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, deafness, etc etc ) were SO interesting. We looked at them from both a scientific neurobiological perspective AND the personal, empathetic perspective. I'm a neurobio guy, and this class was better than Atypical Neurodevelopment at looking at these disorders. We read from the POVs of parents, teachers, students, disabled people, etc. I cried during some of the readings and the movies we watched--they were very moving. I agree with the other reviewers; the most difficult part of the class was the four essays. The long 19W review is not wrong in its description (though I wouldn't describe it so tortuously). I have some disabilities and get accommodations through SAS and I did find Prof Coch to be accommodating, while also holding me to a high standard. The thing is, that's how it should be. As a disabled person, I don't want to be allowed to do subpar work just because I'm disabled. I want to learn to do excellent work--that's why I'm at Dartmouth. Prof Coch seems to understand that idea well. I felt supported and seen by her, AND challenged and pushed by her.\"",

It isn't terribly easy, but at the same time, it's not terribly hard. The workload is totally manageable; you just have to prep for the papers and stay on top of them. This is such an important class that I think everyone should take.\"",

With that out of the way, let me tell you about the horrors of EDUC 064. Donna Coch is a nice woman, but she is extremely unrelatable. Class lectures were always dry and boring, and I fell asleep during them at least half of the time. She expected a lot of \"audience participation,\" where she would basically ask questions about everything in the lectures. It always proved to be awkward and extremely forced since no one wanted to answer. Lectures followed the same format each class, too: an overview of the disorder, the prevalence of the disorder, the diagnosis of the disorder, the treatments for the disorder, the genetics and environmental factors behind each disorder, and the neuroscience behind each disorder, with many different studies thrown in as examples. This format became repetitive and annoying very quickly. Moving on, Coch assigned 4-8 daily readings that would cover some of what we would learn about in class that day. During the term, she gave a total of 10 pop quizzes over each daily reading (these pop quizzes would accumulate to be 10% of the total grade). These readings were SO DRY. I have a passion for education, but these readings made me, someone who would cry reading education 001 readings because they were so moving, fall asleep reading them. There are an overwhelming amount of readings, and they very quickly become tedious. Onto the WORST PART of the class: the papers. Coch assigned four papers during the term; each was 15% of the final grade. These papers could be written about anything that we had covered within a certain time period, as long as you included two primary research articles from outside sources and as long as the papers were 3-4 pages in length. It sounds reasonable until you actually take the class. She is the harshest grader I have ever met. She expects you to be extremely specific about everything in each research article while also including and referencing class sources while also synthesizing your own conclusion while acknowledging the limitations of all of your evidence--all in 4 pages maximum. This was impossible. Every single person in our class struggled to write these papers. If you go to office hours, Coch may--MAY--read your paper and give you notes. This was the only way to get near an A- on the papers. It was the most frustrating experience of my life. Finally, Coch gave a final exam worth 15% of the final grade, which was probably the fairest part of this class. Overall, this class is HELL. I spent countless hours in the library working on this class. I took a very difficult stem class this term along with this class; my stem class was 10x easier than this one, hands down. I will NEVER take another class with Coch again, and I hope that you don't, either. If I hadn't had such an amazing experience in EDUC 001 with Tine, I 100% would have given up on my education minor after this hellish class. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT WHATSOEVER. EVEN IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN SPECIAL EDUCATION LIKE I DO, THIS CLASS IS STILL NOT WORTH TAKING. DO NOT TAKE IT.\"",

Workload: Professor Coch assigned 4 papers, had 2 exams, and gave 1-2 pop quiz per week, often too days in a row.

The class is very varied, with assignments ranging from readings and movies to conducting a real Kohlberg interview and writing a paper analyzing a moment in your own adolescence. This class was a welcome break from my other academic work this term, as it was fun reading -- first-person cases from adolescents (that you cover in discussion sections, which are a really rewarding complement to the classes themselves), TIME articles about teen sexuality, novels with adolescent protagonists, etc. There were a number of guest speakers as well as video clips shown in class, and most of the classes were discussion-based, and very worth attending. Garrod is known for being a great teacher at Dartmouth, and the rumors are true. He's a quaint little british guy who is very matter-of-fact and has been doing what he does for a long time and knows how to do it just right. He's got a sense of humor that lightens the class but also he knows how to lead discussions and probe deeper for further exploration of the issues. He's really an inspiration to do well (and not be late to class!!), and absolutely worth visiting his office hours. There are an absurd number of books to get for this class (as well as a big fat reader from Wheelock) -- but my only advice is, USE THE RESERVES. Garrod is very good about putting all the required books on reserve in the library, so you don't have to pay anything to take this class, you can borrow the textbooks when you need them.

The discussions can be pretty emotionally charged and sometimes uncomfortable, but good things come out of them. If you're looking for a class to cruise through, this isn't the one, but it is good.

Overall, it was a fairly interesting class because we were able to learn and discuss about a wide range of topics. In addition to the 6 pop quizzes, there are debates (you only have to do one yourself in a small group that is randomly assigned) a reflection essay based on that debate and a final exam. The median was a B+ which may be due to the surprisingly difficult quizzes which may sink your grade. Also with each reading you have to post a discussion response but they can be as brief as you want. Professor Kang did not put any grades online all term so your grade is an mystery until the final grades are announced, unless you can remember what you got on every quiz.\""

The main point of frustration for me was the end of term project, which was given in addition to the final. The project was a paper that turned out to be roughly 20 pages for me and required research, synthesis, and obviously a lot of writing. I thought that the project was useful but would have appreciated if it were assigned in chunks over the course of the term instead of all in the last two weeks, coinciding with finals.\"",

This is the objective of the course, according to the ORC. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this regard. The only educational policy that we saw was an analysis of 4-5 specific, narrow cases of educational reform. Don't expect this class to give you an understanding of large scale educational issues - it won't. The class focused instead on leadership development - ways of building influence and challenging existing establishments to change. This WAS valuble, and applicable to my own career plans, even though I would have preferred to learn about the material in the ORC. Unfortunately, a lot of time was spent (wasted?) on class discussions that really didn't go far. People really struggled to apply the concepts to Ed. policy, because they weren't provided with a factual foundation on which to discuss the issues of Ed. policy. Prof. O'Day was an excellent prof in terms of getting to know students, although he seemed afraid to let his knowledge of Ed. Policy serve as a resource in class discussions. He didn't want to lecture, but perhaps some of that would have been useful in creating better discussions. He also likes to play a lot of mind games with the class, to illustrate various principles. All in all, this was not a bad class, and I definitely learned something useful from it, although NOT Educational Policy.

We studied few recent policy developments in education with two exceptions: the tracking policies of one Boston High School and a more general study of charter schools (seeking this type of discourse, I found this to be the most interesting part of the course).

Each class consisted of 1-2 presentations from students and essentially we did the teaching. -Professor Rodis' grading was ridiculous. There are 100 points possible in the entire course so when you miss points on the quiz or presentation or exam, you're losing points from your overall grade. It was possible to get an A- on everything but a B+ as a grade. -Professor Rodis' expectations were not clear. He provided us with rubrics for both the presentations and the paper; when we got our presentation grades back, he took off for things clearly not on the rubric. Given how little he actually \"taught\" in class, his expectations for us were completely unmatched and ridiculous. -The entire class was discussion; after the first week when we all had said something, it was easy to figure out how everyone would comment on everything else. Plus, Professor Rodis presented everything as black and white, only enhancing the repetitiveness of everybody's comments. And what's worse, it was so extremely liberal and biased...

It covered all topics of education and its societal connections, and was extremely rigorous, with sometimes overwhelming amounts of readings, very extensive 'quizzes,' and papers. However, Garrod makes it all worth it as captivating and humorous lecturer, who is so genuinely invested in the material and each and every one of his students that the standing ovation on the last class of the year was well worth it.

Be prepared to spend a lot of quality time in the library curled up with your readers (there are three of them!) and books. And by read, I really mean it! Some of the quiz questions are rather specific. The first draft of your first paper will be a nightmare, but after that they are fairly straightforward. Take advantage of the TAs as they can be very helpful. There are also five mandatory movie nights and weekly discussion sections. Do not let this scare you away! Every bit of work I put into this course was well worth the effort. I learned so much about not only educational problems, but social injustices in general. I am almost ashamed of how naive I was upon entering this course. I honestly feel like a much better person because I am more aware of things I had previous ignored or taken for granted. Garrod inspires such passion for the subject that I am seriously considering completing the teacher certification program, which is something I would have never even thought about before.

You look at diverse issues such as racial and gender inequalities, socioeconomic status, sexuality, varsity sports, teaching about democracy, ways of teaching, cheating, etc. This is a course that really makes you think, and Garrod is just so knowledgeable and understanding with his students. He just really wants you to succeed. It is a lot of work, and a lot of reading. I did it all, but I know of many people who didn't and still did relatively well. But his quizzes do try to see that you've read pretty much all of the assigned readings. Basically 1 movie per week, but you only have the go to 5. Grading is very straight-forward.

As to the workload, it is quite a lot, but it's mostly bitchwork. Tediously memorize random facts from the myriad readings and you should be A-OK. Go to movies that have little or nothing to do with the rest of the syllabus, too. Bottom line: not so awe-inspiring, and probably not what you expected.

In papers 1, 2 and 4 you have to write in this descriptive language that is either difficult or easy to master, depending on your TA.

As students in America who are attending an Ivy League institution, we tend to take our educations for granted. With that in mind, this course is quite eye-opening in many respects. Professor Garrod is a very nice man; he is quite approachable and is great to visit during office hours. He is generally available when you need him, but I've noticed most students don't bother making a connection with him simply because they know the grade they're going to get is completely out of his hands (it's in the hands of the TA). So if you take this class, by all means keep in touch with Garrod throughout the term. He is an invaluable resource and will always help you out if you're feeling lost or muddled. About the TA's: I'm aware that this class may not be taught with TA's in the future. That is sad. I got a chance to work with some awesome undergrad TA's this term. Generally, for the papers, they grade squarely under a set of guidelines. Each TA has his/her own style, which can be annoying at times --- some TA's like to stay in touch by Blitz, and others just get annoyed when you do so and get a total attitude problem (I know of one TA in specific that everyone complained about as having an attitude/ego issue and as being totally unapproachable, and I agree with them in that specific case). But generally the TA's are very approachable, very helpful, and are always going out of their way to help out. I now have a network of friends (TA's) who are seniors & juniors because of this class -- and that's great, particularly because I'm a freshman. I do take issue, however, with the way reading checks are graded in general. All the TA's look for something different and there is absolutely no consistency in how an RC is graded (I know Garrod & the TA's will swear on the Bible that they have standards set for RC's, but even if they do have 'standards' it doesn't work) -- case in point, one TA apparently scored down a friend of mine because he was unable to encapsulate groups of readings into one-word themes (why only one word, only God & that one TA know); another example is that yet another TA scored ME down because I didn't \"organize it the way\" she wanted me to -- she didn't ever explain what that way was. Overall most of the TA's were good though -- some were downright unbearable but others were key to the success of myself & my fellow classmates. LECTURES: Most of the lectures are by guest lecturers. Garrod lectured maybe 5-6 times, max. Sometimes I wish he lectured more, though the guest lecturers did an awesome job of presenting the material. READING: At times the reading can be long, and sometimes boring. But as a whole it is quite engaging. TAKE THIS CLASS! YOU MUST!!\"",

It inspired the most self-reflection of any class I've taken yet. For that reason, I believe that every student at Dartmouth should be exposed to these ideas and issues. Having said that, the actual structure of the class is frustrating and tedious. I have no complaints about the huge amount of reading- it was all extremely relevant and worthwhile. But the 4 self-paced papers are to be honest a complete chafe. They require constant revision and adherence to an arcane \"code\" that Garrod has decided is somehow a useful lesson, presumably to teach brilliant Dartmouth students what it is like to feel stupid and fail- it took me 6 drafts to even pass my first paper. At the beginning of the class Garrod touted its ability to improve the writing of every student, which I feel is completely false. My writing has not at all improved from having taken this class. Lectures (which were all by guest speakers, only one by Garrod) were also not particularly inspiring- most just covered the reading material with a few notable exceptions. Getting to know TAs and other people in the class was great, and reading checks were very effective tools for coming to a personal understanding of the reading and how you related to it. So bottom line: by all means, TAKE THIS CLASS. Just NRO it or even audit it. Or heck, just borrow a friend's readers (yes there are two huge readers) and books and you'll probably get just as much out of it. If you do decide to take it, just get on paper 1 right away and meet with your TA right from the beginning.\"",

I was a bit disappointed by the liberal slant of the class - sometimes the viewpoint was accepted as unquestioned fact in the class, even thought there are often more conservative counterpoints that seem just as legitimate. The real learning in this class, for me, was produced by going to Borders and looking for books that presented the other sides of issues. I thought that this let me see the interplay of the different ideas, and really let me weigh the arguments against each other. It's really a shame that the nearly 200 of reading for Ed 20 didn't include enough material to do this. I think Garrod is a good match to the class, because he works very hard to make lectures interactive and brings in experts to discuss the material. The paper topics were very odd, and took a great deal of time for re-writes. The focus was on writing in this weird descriptive language, and it really prevented any presentation of complex issues. This was a real disappointment - I expected more of the writing component of the class. Overall, though, I would recommend this class to anyone - it definitely gives you a lot to think about. If you're a conservative, though, take your blood pressure medication before class. The same advice goes if you're a moderate liberal.\"",

It caters to different styles of learners from large discussion group settings to small discussion groups right down to one on one reading checks which by the way are the essence of the course in my opinion. Unlike any other class I've taken you 1. become really passionate about the material 2. really understand it, synthesize it, and can draw connections between readings/lecutures and central themes 3. become articulate about talking about it.

Beware the papers - if you choose to take this class (which I recommend for anyone willing to put the necessary amount of time and effort into it) DO NOT put them off. The key to this class is self motivation. There are no deadlines for the papers (aside from the last day of the term) and the only way you are tested on the readings is through a one on one interaction with a TA 4 times over the course of the term. Take this class when you have the time and energy to put into it - and by energy I mean motivation and emotion. This class deals with inequality a great deal, and speaking from personal experience I would not recommend taking this class that also deals with inequality (or by the 3rd week you'll think all the world's problems are your fault).

I didn't really have any intention of being a teacher, and thus felt a bit alienated in this class as it felt like it was solely focused towards that. this may just be the fault of the textbook, though.

Nelson is pretty new to dartmouth but did a good job of keeping the information that is mostly intuitive/boring interesting by mentioning case studies and modern research in the field. there were a couple exams and a paper, which lets you take free rein and research a particular topic within the field that is of interest to you.\""

Professor Ansari is one of the sweetest professors I've had at Dartmouth. He's really good about communicating over blitz, and you can tell he really cares about the students.\"",
            "review 9: \"05S with Daniel Ansari: This might be bitter so take it for what it's worth. I was originally thinking about being an education major, took Ed 1, and changed my mind completely. Professor Ansari's lectures were boring, uninspiring, and based somewhat heavily on sciences. I'm sorry to all those who thought it interesting, but I was interested in education as a discipline, not in just how people learn - although that I recognize that it is an important facet. It was just emphasized so much. But it could be my personality. I don't want to know how people learn scientifically. I want to know how people learn in reality. Anyway - Ansari is okay; he and I had our moments, but whatever. I survived and made out okay. Don't take this class (or any intro class for that matter) if you think you want to major in the subject. Seriously. It'll make you run in the other direction.\"",
            "review 10: \"05S with Daniel Ansari: Unless you're doing the teacher certification program, in which case join me in petitioning that the course be eliminated. If you're at all interested in education, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE, it will turn you off completely, which is very unfortunate. Instead, take Ed. 20 with Garrod, which is the real intro to education. It's a lot more work than Ed. 1, but you'll love the work, every bit of it. If you take Ed. 1, you'll just be angry and frustrated and bored, and worst of all, come away thinking education is a stupid field of study. Please don't take this class. For your own sake and of those who follow you. Maybe if enrollments are low enough they'll recognize their errors and do away with the course. This was almost certainly the worst class I've taken at Dartmouth. (Incidentally, Ed. 20 is almost certainly the best).\"",
            "review 11: \"05S with Daniel Ansari: A great introduction to the variety of topics and courses within the ed department. Prof Ansari is a wonderful teacher - goes over and above what you'd expect and is always available for feedback. Another great reminder of all the great professors and courses in the ed department!\"",
            "review 12: \"05S with Daniel Ansari: It's a lot more science than you probably expect. Prof Ansari is not especially interesting, although he has a teddy bear quality about him. Pretty boring.\""

            "review 1: \"09F with Elise Temple: The 10A timeslot for this course is a killer. Professor Temple is very nice and knows a lot about neuroscience, but the class pretty much consists of going over research studies for two hours, then memorizing those studies for the exams. The writing assignments are easy, but don't have a page limit, so that can be a little difficult. The textbook is terrible. Overall, Educ 1 is informative, but pretty boring. The information is valuable for teachers and pretty much anyone who plans to have a kid-- the course just needs to be tweaked so that it is more exciting and creative.\"",
            "review 2: \"09F with Elise Temple: The class has a heavy emphasis on education research/studies and neuroscience, and offers a very limited perspective on policy and actual implications in the classroom. As the intro class to the minor, the course is a good reminder that there will be some boring times in education. Overall, the course is interesting if you can last through a 10A lecture class without getting bored (there is a break!). The work is not that difficult, just memorize a lot and make sure you're well-versed in brain parts for the exams. Professor Temple is very enthusiastic and nice, but the class itself could use an upgrade.\"",
            "review 3: \"09F with Elise Temple: Maybe this was my fault, but I was under the impression that the course had a higher education emphasis. I mainly thought this because I initially wanted to be education minor. Also because I thought since it is an introduction course there would be more education policies and general education material. However, the main thing is that the course is very neurology focused. In order to succeed, the best method is to view all the material by considering how the brain is affected. This is also apparent in the professor's method of teaching. Although she is knowledgeable about other education topics it is obvious that her strong point is developments in the brain. Regardless the course is pretty informative in, you guessed it, brain development in young children but does present an approach to education in a pragmatic aspect.\"",
            "review 4: \"09F with Elise Temple: Prof Temple is great. She's so much fun, very engaging, very obviously interested in the subject. The material did get a little repetitive by the end of the term, but it was overall an interesting, not too difficult class. Perfect for a random interest type class\"",
            "review 5: \"08S with Elise Temple: I took this class during Senior Spring because I needed an SOC distrib and because I wanted to learn more about education. Professor Temple teaches the class from the perspective of a neuroscientist, which was exciting because she taught us about bleeding-edge research. The brain science perspective also added a bit of scientific rigor to the course. Professor Temple was very accommodating to student questions and requests, and prepared well for her lectures. She uses powerpoint extremely well. I can't think of many negative aspects of the course. One time we had a class consisting of a silly quiz game, which was fun but not very educational. Also, know that Professor Temple often uses \"I\" and \"me\" incorrectly, and says screwy things like \"the test subjects did very good on the experiment\" instead of \"... did very well ...\" These things bug me. If they bug you too, you might go crazy listening to some of Prof. Temple's lectures. All things considered, EDUC 001 with Temple is an outstanding course! One of my top 10 during all my time at Dartmouth!\"",
            "review 6: \"08F with Elise Temple: This is much more of a psych course than an education one. With that said, it was interesting and pretty easy, and Temple is a nice professor.\"",
            "review 7: \"08F with Elise Temple: Interesting class. Not bad for a 10A. Not too much work. The textbook was interesting but boring.\"",
            "review 8: \"08F with Elise Temple: This class is all about child development, which wasn't exactly what I expected (there weren't many connections to the institution of education). Professor Temple gives good lectures, but the textbook is really frustrating to read (poorly organized and repetitive). In all, a good class if you're interested in learning how children learn.\"",
            "review 9: \"08F with Elise Temple: ED 1 is not a great class or an awful one, it's just not very memorable or engaging. Professor Temple is a great person and very enthusiastic and well prepared for the lectures, but I think it's the course design that dooms this one. Both the textbook and the lectures follow the same format, which is to present a long line of experiments that have been performed on infants and young children. Many times the second half of class is spent going over the research study we were assigned to read for homework, which is more an exercise in learning to understand how to read scientific articles in general than learning about child development in a cohesive way. The workload is average, with a big midterm and final that require a ton of work to fill out her review guides. The three writing assignments are a HUGE pain that require you to track down an appropriate research article and then tediously analyze every little aspect of it....my advice for these would be to get the articles as soon as you can and work on them throughout the term so you're not in trouble the night before they're due, because they take much longer than you would think. Overall, this class is good for someone who might want to go into brain/child development research, but it won't be interesting for anyone else. It really shouldn't be included as a requirement for secondary teacher certification, as I can't imagine that anything I might take with me will be relevant when I am a high school teacher. The links we make to education are few and far between, and I feel like I just didn't learn very much overall about anything. Contrasted with psych 1, where I learned about ten really interesting new things everyday, Ed 1 is a far inferior experience and I would recommend it only for those with a specific interest in the material or for those who have to take it for the minor or the Teacher Ed program.\""

            "review 1: \"19S with Donna Coch: The content of the class is very interesting for anyone w/ any interest in sociology, psychology or education but Coch is not a teacher I would recommend. Take the class w/ someone else if you can. Coch had a very ambiguous, confusing grading style. The tests were unnecessarily harsh. It was pretty ironic that the class was centered around \"good teaching styles,\" yet she did not effectively apply most of them. Take caution when signing up for ed 1 w coch, it definitely won't be easy\"",
            "review 2: \"19S with Donna Coch: Introduction to Education with Donna Coch is the only experience at Dartmouth I'm inclined to describe negatively. I have never interacted with a university professor less receptive to reason, feedback, and honest communication. Notwithstanding exercises that solely test rote memorization or manufactured reflection, nearly every course facet mirrored the poor teaching techniques she decried in lecture. Be it excessive exam count, limited feedback, non-interactive discussion, unjustifiably stringent grading, or the litany of other pedagogical defects: This course\u2014with this professor\u2014is a strange contradiction. To those who take Intro to Education with Ms. Coch, I can only wish you the best. To those who don't, mistake averted. Beware.\"",
            "review 3: \"18S with Donna Coch: DO NOT take this class as a layup. If you aren't sincerely passionate about the material it suuuuuckss. Coch's class focus' on education legislature which can be super dry. Also, she grades things harsher than any teacher I have had before-- doesn't give extra credit and tries to trick you with her questions on tests. It's actually crazy how she will give lectures about bad grading techniques and then employ those very techniques herself in class-- i.e. rogue memorization. I would suggest if anything to stay away from Coch she is the worst and will completely kill your passion for education.\""

She is incredibly knowledgeable, fun, and engaged in the lectures, and really really wanted us to engage in the class and take home learnings. Not a ton of work and readings are not super mandatory but will really help your engagement in the class. Midterms and the final were not super hard but definitely require studying.\"",
            "review 2: \"21F with Michelle Tine: I learned a lot in this class and professor Tine is amazing in teaching. I usually find it a bit hard to learn only through lectures, but this lecture class was a big highlight of my term for me because the way professor Tine explained the subject helped me learn so much. Another very good aspect of this class is that you don't really have to do the readings to do well. Actually, professor Tine doesn't use the readings at all in exams - all the exams are based on the slides she uses to teach the class. She posts the slides on canvas after class. In the beginning of the term I used to do all readings (sometimes 60+ pages of reading), but in the middle to the end of the term I began only doing the readings that were more interesting to me. Also, the readings are very very good and they differ a lot in style. That being said, the class is not a layup because it's not easy to get A. I worked a lot and I managed to end up with a A-, but the tests are not easy. Some of the questions are very tricky and it can be hard to perform well on the multiple choice questions. However, professor Tine is very fair in the way she corrects the exam, and the short answer part of the test is very well-structured. Overall, I recommend this class. You will not have a huge amount of work daily, only when we have exams (two midterms and one final exam). It is a good class to balance with classes that have more work and that the grading system is more completion-based instead of mastery-based. If you are an international student, be a lot of the content of this class is US based. However, there are a lot of interesting topics. If you are interested in understanding educational systems, this class is a very interesting class. If you are a freshman and is still not sure about the minor in education, I recommend taking another class that you are really interested in and then taking intro to education if you like the class. Don't take this intro class first because it's very content heavy and I honestly don't think this class helped me decided on my minor.\"",
            "review 3: \"18F with Michelle Tine: I cannot recommend this class enough. Prof Tine is a passionate and inspiring teacher who made me leave class every day feeling happy, excited, and empowered. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, she is always open to questions, kind and heartfelt in her answers, and very fair on the exams. Whether or not you are interested in becoming a teacher, the material in this class is relevant to you as a student and as a citizen in a country in which the majority of children go through the public education system. You will not regret taking this class with Prof Tine!\""

            "review 1: \"06F with Michael W.: The course was very interesting; though I know that I had trouble following it many times because the reading didn't really align with the content of the lectures and it was difficult to discern what was important from the readings. Prof. Connell is a really nice guy, and he's tries hard...but it was sometimes difficult to follow his train of thought through the diagrams he drew on the board and in his lectures. He was very receptive to concerns and spent a great deal of time responding to essays; however, some of the lectures were ineffective and I ended up confused even more. For example, his description of ANNs was the same every time, and for those who were confused about how exactly they worked, it was difficult to get an \"acceptable\" answer. I think the material is at blame for this because it is very abstract and at points, kind of dry, and Prof. Connell was receptive to this, but overall, it was a little difficult to pay attention and follow the lectures.\"",
            "review 2: \"06F with Michael W.: This class could be good. Education is a really, really interesting subject, and I'm glad I didn't give up on it because of this course. It was cool to have every different Ed prof come and teach once, so we got to see all the different sub-topics in the department. It was good to get a background as prep for Ed20 and 29, which are highly recommended. Otherwise, this class sucked. Connell was a nice guy, but too smart for his own good. He was commuting from Boston too, so I just felt bad for him. We would joke about how he was teaching us proper teaching methods, but not employing them himself. The class had a lot of very technical and scientific subject matter, and a LOT of reading that I was never able to finish. The essays and tests were really tough too. The class bonded over how screwed up it all was. Basically, education is great, the material that this class covered was fascinating and really cool to learn, but they need to restructure this course to make it bearable.\""
