Prof. Edmondson is so great. She would cancel classes to hold extra office hours around essay due dates. She's very understanding with extensions. She genuinely cares about her subject and she is so knowledgable. Be warned that the subject matter is dark at times. It does a great job of showing things from a variety of perspectives, but... homophobia is homophobia, and a fair amount of the readings do deal with that. You have to do the reading because the class is VERY discussion based. We had... two lectures? and a couple movie days, but everything else was group discussion. Prof. Edmondson is a great facilitator and definitely keeps the discussion moving smoothly. Also, the final project looks daunting on paper but it was genuinely so much fun. Like, I genuinely enjoyed it. This professor had me LOOKING FORWARD to a FINAL--and NOT because I just wanted out of the class! That was partly due to the other students in my group, but in a small class with such intense discussion, you tend to get along well with your classmates. Anyway, while that did take like 7ish hours of preparation outside of class, it's in my top three favorite memories of 22W. Highly recommend if you're willing to put the effort in, but don't take it if you just want to do the bare minimum. No prior knowledge needed.\""

We only started directing practice in the last three weeks (with FAR AWAY by Caryl Churchill, who I would not consider to be an author from a \"diverse cultural background\") and I only got actual feedback on my directing on the last day of class. As long as you do the work on time he's pretty reasonable with grades, but it's all script analysis (just poke holes in the story and point out where lines lack specificity). Peter Hackett also has a habit of treating white students preferentially and that was evident in his casting of the show we observed (which required a 50% global majority cast and DEFINITELY did not have that). \"Particular attention will be paid to methods for building a creative ensemble based on respect and mutual understanding\" yeah not true. Didn't touch on that once. He assigned pre-reading over the summer and forgot about it. He forgot basic details about ourselves we had shared with him. I can't tell if he just wasn't paying attention or if his retirement age is getting to him. He has so, so much experience, but I think observing rehearsals did significantly more for me as an actor than a director. I guess I can say the same about script analysis while I'm at it: it was more helpful as an actor than as a director. It's the same script analysis you do in Acting 1, just beefed up a bit.

It is at first a very technical approach, but you find a lot of artistic freedom within the limitations.

However, for Playwrighting 1 Prof. Sutton is only interested in teaching you to write one kind of play - the kind of play that it is meant to be effective for beginning playwrights to write. This basically means a single central character who is trying to acheive something (his \"throughaction\") with a certain groups of techniques or \"tactics\" but is blocked by the actions of about two other people who he is meant to need something from (\"obstacles.\") There are a few problems with teaching only one style of playwrighting. First, there is really not all that much to learn about such a simple structure, so Prof. Sutton ends up repeating the same things over, and over, and over again. It would be more efficient to just pick up one of the texts in the bookstore and read everything once. More importantly, this is not all theater can be. Some of the best writers in the class never followed this structure, and when they were forced to do a naturalistic, straight-forward main-character throughaction/obstacles play for the final project, their work suffered. If the goal of the class is truly \"for each student to write the best one-act play he or she is capable of writing,\" Prof. Sutton would educate his students about a variety of techniques and let them decide for themselves what will work best for the play they want to write. He would end up with much more interesting and innovative work. If you do decide to take this class, you will write a one-act play next term, but it will have to be the kind Prof. Sutton taught you about or your grade will suffer.\"",
            "review 14: \"01F with Joseph Sutton: The most valuable thing that this course taught me was to avoid profs who were egomaniacs at any cost. Sutton wants people to write exactly as he does and with his vision and philosophy of playwrighting. My biggest problem with this course is that he lies about how he grades. He says at the beginning that he will not grade based on the merit of the material produced, but ends up assigning grades based on how close to his style of drama the play comes. If you can write straight realism with three characters then go for it, but if you cripple your style by trying you'll struggle in the course. I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone because of the prof- there are better writing courses to be had here.\"",
            "review 15: \"01F with Joseph Sutton: Like most creative/art classes, this one is what you make of it. If you want it to be easy, it probably can be. I had a class of ten very driven people and we worked very hard to write plays to be proud of, and it was a huge amount of work. The weekly assignments were usually to write some portion of a play or scene, which we would read out loud in class and get feedback. There were also assignments of playwriting theory to read, and Joe Sutton would give half-hour lectures on theory at the beginning of each class. His feedback would often be in terms of thees theories. This was not all that great because it is only one f many ways to look at plays, and he has a very \"my way or the highway\" attitude. But it's not that hard to just ignore him and write a good play anyway. Feedback from classmates was often the best. This is the kind of class where you know everyone's name by the second week, and will be joking with each other by the end. DON'T BE SCARED TO TAKE THIS IF YOU AREN'T A HARD CORE WRITER OR DRAMA MAJOR. THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN MY CLASS WITH NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL.\""

At the same time, I can confidently say that my playwriting skills are significantly improved. The classwork is super manageable. It consists of mostly in-class writing exercises and writing one-page responses to short plays that you read outside of class, until the end of the class when you write a longer, 10-minute play as your final project. Liliana starts off by mostly lecturing about playwriting technique and various tools that can be used, but the class becomes more and more collaborative/discussion-based as it goes on, especially once people start sharing drafts of their work.

The play readings are always interesting, and Liliana chooses such meaningful stories to discuss in class. They start with very short plays, before switching to full-length plays about halfway through the term, so the readings are always manageable and allow for plenty of time to read. Liliana's teaching style was pretty laid-back but super effective, they also always made an effort to provide office hours for students and created a really collaborative classroom environment.

Readings would take about an hour total per week (I\u2019m a slow reader). The second half of the class, we\u2019d do check-ins and readings of our own work to get feedback.

I came into the course expecting to create costumes, but found that that's Construction, held every other winter (next due: 05W). This course focuses on the designs themselves--sketching, rendering, color, line, and texture. Projects range from colored pencil renderings to full-on fabric collages (the most painful project I've ever done). There's one about every week, so be ready to work on the weekends, and don't leave it all for sunday night (you won't get it done, trust me). She uses all the x-hours. From this course I'm definitely taking a new appreciation for the work that goes into costuming theatrical presentations. I never would have thought that so much went into a show's color scheme. Now I watch movies and see characters given focus with brighter colors, and bit characters dressed in earth tones. I enjoyed the \"art project\" aspect of the course, even though they took a significant amount of work. The class is small, and each project is individually critiqued by the entire class, so no one can hide behind a lackadaisical effort. Professor Spicer does not allow for as much flexibility as she lets on. She is very serious about staying in period, even though she may tell you that abstraction is part of theater. Don't fret, though, as we're beginniners and can't yet be expected to artfully stray from proper historical costumes. :) Overall, I'd recommend this course to anyone who is willing to put some work in for a new view on the people who work behind the stage and screen. If you like art projects, the assignments can be enjoyable, so just be prepared to put in some major hours.\"",

Costume renderings could be time-consuming for the days before they were due but they were so fun to work on. I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking to get creative or fulfill the design requirement for the theater major (as I was).

One of the nicest things about our class was the combination of different people -- we had theater majors, biochemistry majors, freshmen, and seniors (and this in a group of 8 people). Everyone has something different to bring to the table and Dan respects that -- so don't be afraid of taking this class if you've never been to a play or drawn anything more complicated than a stick figure.

As a non-theater major, I took this class out of simple curiosity and was thrown off by its intensity. The projects, which are given almost every week, can be very time- consuming. The group projects are especially difficult because everyone seems to have some kind of \"schedule conflict.\" In addition to the projects, you are required to put in 30+ hours working on a school play as a stage hand. Working on the stage can be tiring, but it is quiet moving to attend the performance knowing that you put up that blue light in the corner. If you are not a theater major and the GPA matters a lot (premeds, for example), I would recommend it with some reservations. Be sure that you can put in a lot of work hours and see the prof. often.

            "review 5: \"03F with Kathleen Cunneen: This course was one of the best I've taken at Dartmouth. I wish I'd taken it earlier. First the course: The basic thing that was done was stage managing the mainstage production of the Department of Theater - this term it was Arthur Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\" - directed by visiting director Jackson Gay. What does that mean? Well - as you'll learn by taking this class - the nutshell version is that we created a safe, supportive environment to allow the process of making theater possible - through communication and organization . That's just an inkling of all the stuff that you do through the class. If you take this class, be prepared to attend many rehearsals, production meetings, etc - the class didn't meet all the time when alloted, some days we just went to rehearsal instead. Rehearsal is generally Su-Fri 7-11 (with some time before and after for setup/takedown). Class met 6-7:30, m, tu, thurs, in theory. \"Tech Week\" for the show is quite time consuming - plan ahead. It can involve 12-18 hours on a single weekend, followed by evenings later on. The good news is that there's little actual reading - one book which is assigned early on in small pieces that is an easy (and I think) interesting read. I don't think the class particularly cared for it though. There's also reading the play (a couple times) to become familiar with it. A few small assignments in the beginning. And weekly \"journal-things\" to keep track of your progress. There's a final project - in the last weeks of the term, after the mainstage, another play is read, and we basically did the paperwork and preparation for it. It can be somewhat time consuming and the idea of assigning it earlier on in the term was brought up. The course gives a great overview of not just what stage management is and how to do it, but also how the department works, the people in it, and the process of the mainstage. Finally - the best part, perhaps, is meeting and spending a lot of time and going through the stage management process with Kathleen, and the people with your class. You really all get to know each other and get a great mentor in the process. You also learn a lot about yourself, your management style, and so on.\"",
            "review 6: \"01F with Kathleen Cunneen: Theater 41 was a class that I took my first term at Dartmouth, and I can't imagine having the great experience here that I did without having taken the class. For one thing, most of my friends are involved in the theater department and were involved with \"As You Like It\" (the play we stage managed in Fall 01), and thus I met them through taking this class. We were very lucky in that all six of us (that's right, it's a very small class) in the class clicked, and worked togethery happily and productively. The course was interesting and extraordinarily helpful if you have any interest in theater, since you automatically get to know the ins and outs of the department, and you also learn about all of the jobs that go on in order to create any sort of show. The readings were just as interesting and helpful as Kathleen, herself, and there wasn't even that much of it - most of the work, and there was a LOT of it, was in the form of going to rehearsals, creating lists and other paperwork, and doing other various work for \"As You Like It.\" As fo Kathleen, I only wish that I could give her something higher than A+. More than anything else, she made the class the relaxed, loving, fun experience that it was, and she taught us by making us do things, instead of just lecturing to us. A professional stage manager with years of experience, she knew everything there is to know about the job, and communicated that knowledge to us extraordinarily well. And as for developing a personal relationship with a professor - rest assured, by the end of the term, you will, by the very nature of the class. Overall, a class I would recommend to anybody who is willing to put in the work - if you can't commit to spending quite a bit of time, most of it in the evening (the class meets from 6:30 - 7:00, and all rehearsals are from 7:00 - 11:00), then it's not the class for you, since everybody needs to pull their weight in order to make the class a success.\"",
            "review 7: \"01F with Kathleen Cunneen: This class was a lot of fun and unlike any other class i've taken at dartmouth. We really got a chance to work closely with and get to know the other students in the class and the prof. Yes, it is a big time commitment in the evenings, but 4 hours of rehearsal is much better than 4 hours of reading or doing a problem set. I would recommend this class to someone whether they're a major or not.\""

Scott Silver is a funny and easygoing prof, but is no-nonsense when it comes to business. He lays out the requirements of the course right away, and if you don't fulfill them you won't do well. Simple as that. A lot of out-of-class time is required in the shop, but all it takes a few hours every day or every other day and you'll easily meet the requirement. Plus, building sets is fun, and you learn a lot about design and construction, if you're in to that at all. Definitely a good class to take, a pre-req for the major, and fun for all.\"",

Scott, Joel, and Carl are great in the shop and Scott gives fine lectures. It's a theater course for everyone. Nerds, jocks, thespians and collis crunchy hippies alike. The tests are preposterously easy if you take notes in class and have access to the book. Literally I think I spent a combined 37 minutes on both take home exams. Shop hours = your grade (don't ever skip class or....you fail). 50 hours = B, 75 hours = A. Now, that's kind of a chafe (lord knows I haven't spent close to half that in any of my other courses in 4 years) but working the mainstage or building in the shop is pretty relaxing. Take the class. As Carl says, you'd have to be a f***ing idiot to not get an A.\"",

Nevertheless, if you want to learn alot about what goes on behind the scenes in Theater and if you want to leave a Dartmouth Course with that warm and fuzzy rewarding feeling, this could possibly be the course for you. I came into the course ignorant of almost everything when it comes to onstage and backstage theater. After leaving the course, I not only have a profound knowledge of what actually takes place behind stage, but I have a thorough understanding on how to use practical handy tools and power tools to create almost anything. Also I have definitely learned how to be quick on my toes.\"",

True, it is not very difficult to get a good grade in the class but the hours you will spend in the workshop completely make up for the simple take-home open-book exams and the single assignment/project. The course is definitely a great way of learning a bit about everything involved in putting together a mainstage production (not just the technical aspect); the lectures are simply overviews but they tie in nicely with almost everything you will be doing for the mainstage so that at the end of the term you really feel that you can speak to anyone about theater production. A great intro course for anyone even remotely interested in theater. Also, a great way to balance a stressful courseload - those hours in the workshop, thinking of nothing but wood, paint, and softgoods is a great way of taking ones mind off other mundane school stuff.\"",
            "review 13: \"04F with Scott Silver: This a probably one of the best \"hands-on\" classes at Dartmouth. You learn all aspects of the technical work that goes into theater productions - which are essentially things like woodworking, lighting, painting, set design, stage crew, etc. The class is very easy but you need to spend at least 50 hours over the term working in the shop or doing stage crew (and about 75 hours will get you an A). Your grade is based almost entirely on your hours in the shop and how productive you are while you're there. Just beware that even though it's an easy class, the shop requirement will take up the bulk of your free time during the term.\"",

This is a great introduction to the world of theater production from a non-acting, sort of atypical side of things. The majority of your grade is based on whether or not you complete the required time in the scene shop (\u201cfishbowl\u201d by the HBs) satisfactorily \u2013 and to do this, you will need to start early on in the term, and be sure to plan to have your hours done by the last show of the term, when that\u2019s done, there are basically no more hours left (and it comes quickly). It appeared to me like running a show \u2013 light board, sound board, or \u2018running crew\u2019 would have been a good way to get hours out of the way quickly, and easily, if you can make that time commitment. Carl Choquette, who is the master carpenter helps with a lot of the stuff in the scene shop, although he\u2019s not a prof. Both Carl and Scott REALLY know this stuff cold and are experts in the craft. They really inspired me in terms of theater. I wish I could\u2019ve taken more theater courses while here. Stage management sounds really interesting. The exams were quite easy \u2013 take home, open book, open note. There were a few quizzes, didn\u2019t seem to count for much and they were easy. And you get to use big (and small) tools, learn to do stuff that is just useful in general. Get a good night sleep before strike, though.\""

It's a small class of 10 people and I was amazed how closely we got to know each other and how safe we felt to be vulnerable. --- The class is about freeing up your natural voice, we did a lot of breathing and voice exercises, and there are presentations -- like 3-minute self-presentation, giving a political speech, telling a silly fairy tale, etc. At the end of the class, there's a big performance/presentation for friends. --- This class changed me a lot.

His enthusiasm for the subject and just general good humor made every class a joy to go to, and he knows how to get down to business while still having a good time. And it showed: every student--of all experience levels--in the class showed marked growth by the end of the term. The readings were well chosen, and though there was a decent amount of reading to do, it was not unmanageable. Some extra rehearsal time was required outside of class (usually 2-3 hours a week after the midterms). And the course was a little top-heavy. No papers or exams, just presentations and scene work, which were generally fun to do, and very helpful feedback was always given. Journaling could be a bit tedious at times, but it did provide you a nice outline of the creative process throughout the term. If anything, it was a small price to pay for an amazing class.

It is also such a nice class to meet new people. You become very close with every single person in your class, and all of you become one big family.

I think anyone who is actually interested and willing to put in some work will really enjoy this class. It has been one of my favorite classes at Dartmouth! I will say though, Professor Rice does assign a lot of homework. You have weekly logs to turn in on Saturdays and a very long written final, so I wouldn't exactly call it a layup in that sense.

Yeah, the classes are pretty much devoted to acting exercises so it is easy to put in a lot of effort, but there is a ton of work outside of class.

You have to watch 5 live performances, 5 movies, and read 2 plays and respond to each of those. On top of that you must maintain journal entries for each class and some other in class assignments. Rice uses every x hour, and you're expected to meet with him at least three times for coaching sessions before each scene you perform (2 scenes in total). Additionally, you must rehearse with your acting partners before each coaching session with Rice. We only got a week to prepare for the final scene, so it felt like a lot of the work was back piled towards the end of the term. Beyond the coursework, you'll gain a community of friends amongst your classmates. Rice does an amazing job of creating a safe and inclusive environment in the classroom where we all felt comfortable talking to each other about anything.

For example, there's a lot of emphasis on breathing and a bit of a self-help twist. It's great because this enables you to get to know your class, but it also may cause frustration if you're looking for a class that starts early with scenes etc. (We only looked at a scripted scene in the last couple weeks of class).

You also get to bond with your class, so you will probably be friends until graduation. The written assignments were demanding, in the sense that we had to commit to daily journal writing. My advice: do it on time, or you will not be happy when the time to turn it in comes. Also, there is some reading involved, and all kinds of other writings, but that is not nearly the most important part of the course, it is just the necessary part. In class we got to learn about breathing techniques, movement and voice training, and how to get our life on the stage. we became less self conscious and more comfortable with each other with every class. It was the course that helped me through this term, freshman fall... it helped me adjust to college life and it helped me find a special group of people whom I now consider some of my closest friends.

On the one hand, Prof. Rice is an incredible professor at times who obviously cares deeply about what he does and the students to whom he devotes an absurd amount of time. He invests more of himself in this course than any other prof I've encountered. I also had a lot of fun, met a lot of people I wouldn't have otherwise encountered, and learned a lot about myself. With that said, Prof. Rice can be unncessarily harsh, close-minded, and demanding. I walked in late ONE time and after I had told him I would be late because of religious reasons (which he acknowledged at the time) and I still got a glare from him upon my arrival. So...my verdict? take it, but be aware that the course is a lot of busy work, touchy-feely crap, and unnecessary hassle. With that said, it is often a lot of fun and you learn pragmatic skills like public speaking.\"",

Don't expect a pushover class, though, Professor Rice expects that you will devote considerable time to the readings and the mandatory journal entries. Also, all theater department shows must be attended and rehearsal with partners is expected. As long as you are prepared to participate fully and willing to work hard in and out of class, Acting 1 is sure to be a good experience. It is by permission only, so be prepared to meet with Professor Rice and explain why you want to take the class.\"",

I would especially recommend taking it freshman year because the class develops a sort of ensemble feel and you get to know your classmates very well by the end of the term. It's a nice way to start off classes. That being said, there is a lot of work for the class. the work is all rather easy, but there is a lot of it. You are required to keep a journal and record responses to everything theater-related you do (read a play, see a play, go to class, etc.) Most of the reading is very boring and long winded. There is one kernel of important information surrounded by many pages of repetition and hot air in most of the readings. Many projects require out of class rehearsal time -- sometimes at odd hours. However, if you're willing to put in the work, this course will definitely be worth your while. The teacher is understanding of students and passinate about his work.

She constantly professes her hatred of FOX and Trump and Republicans and imposes her views on you, not letting you express your own opinions. But you can rewrite things if she doesn't like them. Just show up to class. She boos people who come in late. Don't get on her bad side. You also won't learn anything.\"",

You do one real academic essay, a short story, and the rest are scripts (super fun to write and also read in class). The final is basically anything you want to do as long as its a piece of \"theater for social change.\" Find something you're passionate about changing, and you'll do well.\"",

This was so bad if you are thinking of taking this seminar no dont. She is crazy and has no idea what she is talking about. She is so outdated and if you google her she tried to sue Dartmouth. Advice always google professors before you take the class you can tell alot about a person by there google info. She cant even fairly grade. All she does is sitt there and talk about her life.\"",
            "review 5: \"08W with Mara Sabinson: I didn't learn anything about writing in this course, and I only learned some things about theater in that class. I think that the packets that she hands out can be dull, but they have a point. Overall she is really critical about the stories and scripts you have to write for the class (you only write 2). She doesn't really offer much as to how to improve your writing even in a theater setting. There isn't much direction and she doesn't really give you many guidelines for what you are supposed to do. Overall I did not like the class, but a lot of people would say that is was easy since you don't do much; Two papers, two scripts, a presentation and reading packets(that most people don't do). You can rewrite most of it as much as you want though, and in a one on one setting she can be really nice, but in class she is brutal.\"",
            "review 6: \"08S with Mara Sabinson: While in the beginning of the term we were assigned loads of reading that 80% of the class didn't do, the latter part of the course all came down to an independent research project. On the topic of choice you wrote a 1000 word paper, a 3000 word paper, and did a presentation, which made up 75% of your grade. I considered this research the strength of the course. The majority of class time was spent discussing and watching contemporary artists (youtube was a large component of the course), which was very fun. A good freshman seminar to take.\"",

We watched a lot of youtube comedy videos, and your research paper can be on pretty much whatever you want- as long as it's somewhat pertinent to theater & social change. Some of the readings are interesting. Some are not. You can get away with skipping the boring ones...just try to have something to say.\"",
            "review 8: \"08F with Mara Sabinson: Professor Sabinson is somewhat of a hot-button teacher. It is easy to offend her, especially whe you interrupt her. She's eloquent and intelligent, but she also seemed to pick favorites in class. Her style of paper grading is somewhat convoluted, but overall, she was a good freshman seminar professor. The video clips and readings she chose were all interesting, and the workload was light and fun if you chose a topic in which you held interest.\"",
            "review 9: \"07W with Mara Sabinson: Mara Sabinson is very helpful and understanding....she sets out the task at hand and then helps you get through it. I only wish we could have had more time in the course. She assigned the papers early and gave us time with her to discuss (and strengthen) our theses, and she was always up for a good laugh in class and made interesting subject matter even more interesting.\""

Be careful not to get on her bad side, because she was merciless in making fun of students she did not particularly favor.\"",

The material was really diverse. If you want to focus on different issues in your seminar, this semiar can be the proper one for you. The spectrum of topics is really wide. The instructors are pretty much informed about the material covered in this seminar.

Freedom is great.\"",

We saw two versions of Romeo and Juliet, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Glengarry Glen Ross, and Roxie Hart and Chicago. We a;lso watched commentary on most of these movies which made things pretty boring. The discussions were not really related to class and usually centered around making movies. The best part of the class was that we were allowed to write a screenplay for one of our essay options. Professor Phillips is a really nice guy and knows a lot about film writing.\""

We only had one assignment - a final paper that was due on the last day of classes before Thanksgiving, so no one has any idea how they're going to do in the class. Annabelle cancelled class a lot, and during the week that we had guest lectures from people working on Rocky Horror Show (the director, costume designer, technical director, etc.) she didn't even show up to class. An interesting experience.\"",

There is no midterm or final, only a midterm project and a final paper (which half the class wrote the day before it was due.) Annabelle is nice (and very helpful and available outside of class) but her lectures are long and not quite interesting enough to merit their length. This is certainly an easy class but not really challenging or interesting.\"",

She has no criteria for grading and depends on whether she likes you or not. The midterm is a joke because she gives everyone horrible grades since if it is not done how she would have done it, it is unworthy of anything above a D. During office hours she is condescending and not helpful at all. Every time I went to see her she spent time telling me how I didn't know anything and how she wasn't going to spoon feed me when I just asked how she wanted a paper set up. She also goes off on rants about different political subjects, which can be amusing but no one dares challenge her because she is crazy! I really enjoyed theater before taking this class. Now I don't think I'll ever take a theater class at Dartmouth again!\"",

If you have absolutely no theater background whatsoever, it may be a decent idea to take it but if you've ever been in a play, seen a play, or read about theater in any other capacity it will probably be pretty boring. Annabelle does know her stuff but she definitely knows it and she really always thinks that she is right. She spent the entire term talking about basically the same things. She is often really obnoxious and mean to her students and embarrasses people in class. There were a lot of readings but you didn't have to do them as the only 2 assignments were two papers which were very long and which we were only given a few days notice about. Don't take this course unless you have to.\""
