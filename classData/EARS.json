Although Professor Rhim is a little awkward at times, she is very sweet and very good at responding on slack when you need help on an assignment. She always connects what we are reading to things happening outside of class and provides more resources for people to read into the topics more extensively. She is a pretty easy grader, but is a stickler for the late work policy (unless you slack her asking for more time). She also brought in many guest speakers that had written some of the articles we had read in class which was amazing. You can tell that she really cares about the content she teaches and always wants us to engage as well. Would definitely recommend taking this class or any classes that she may be teaching in the future.\""

            "review 1: \"21W with Sarah Slotznick: Buckle your seatbelts because this is going to be a class like no other. First off, this class is not a layup\u2014at least not how Sarah has it set up right now, and this is not just me saying this, almost everyone I've talked with in our 15 person class has said they were struggling with the course load at some point. The course content is very interesting, and it's definitely really cool to learn about how many factors actually could have contributed to life on Earth and how to search for life elsewhere in the solar system, galaxy or universe. I feel like if you are a bio major/have interest in bio or have a lot of experience with studying the origin of life then the first half of the class actually wouldn't be too bad. THE COURSE LOAD IS A LOT. The basic gist of the course work is 3 pre-recorded lectures a week split into two parts each that can range anywhere between 15min-35+ mins, so its about 3 hours of watching lectures outside of class. Sarah's handwriting isn't the best on these slides so you really have to be listening and taking diligent notes because she will just draw arrows pointing at diagrams and then explain their importance without writing it out. And then we also had 1-2 scientific journal papers or a book chapter to read each week that we would discuss in class, but weeks 6-10 there were less readings. The early papers were very academic jargon-heavy so kind of hard to understand, but it wasn't too bad. Class time is either dedicated to discussions on the readings or exercises that are actually pretty tough and are not graded that easy. There were 6 exercises that you complete with a partner or small group spread out over the course of the quarter, and while they do cover topics that are related to what we learned in lecture, they go a lot more indepth and almost all of them we had to look up information on google to finish the exercise. The worst part is that Sarah grades pretty harsh looking for key words or concepts that if you don't say exactly what she wants to say, she will mark points off, but she does her best to make the exercises interactive. We are allowed to work together in or out of class and share answers but obviously not copy each others answers. We also had 3 quizzes, in week 2, 4, and 7. These were open note, open canvas lectures/readings, and a mix of T/F, fill in the blank, and short response but they are not easy. Originally they were open from noon on Friday to midnight on Friday, but our class asked for extended time and Sarah opened the last two from Friday at noon to Sunday or Monday at noon. Since they are open note, Sarah makes you think with your answers and will sometimes ask really obscure questions that need some clarification. These are also graded pretty tough. The quizzes are curved a little bit, but there were always some kids who would score close to 100% so she couldn't curve that much. The culminating project of this class is a big Sci-Fi paper where you research a controversial Astrobiology topic/theory and then write a research paper that resembles the style of the research papers we had read over the course of the class. You research your topic and then also have to use the academia to come up with a potential way to prove or disprove the theory. We also had to give a short 3-5 min presentation on our topic to the class but that wasn't too bad. We also have a take-home final exam that was structured just like the canvas quizzes\u2014it's open for 72 hours but while the canvas quizzes are supposed to take about an hour, the final exam is supposed to take around 3 hours. Overall, as I said above, the course is actually really interesting and I learned a lot, it was just a lot of work that I was not expecting. At least everyone in the class was struggling together. I don't know if Sarah will change the structure of this course in the future as this is only the 2nd time she taught this class. The best thing is that Sarah is SUPER good at granting extensions on anything if you ask her before the due date. You cannot ask her for an extension the same day, but she is willing to give extensions and try to help you the best she can if you need it. I was sick two different times this quarter and I never felt like I couldn't ask for an extension. Definitely email Sarah and ask for the syllabus if you're not completely sure about taking this class. The knowledge is rewarding but if you're taking a really hard term, I would not recommend this class on top of other hard classes.\"",
            "review 2: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: Shitty shitty shitty. I've taken ASTRO 15 and EARS 33 and thought this class could be a fun median because I am actually quite interested in astrobio stuff... I have never felt like a class was so painful to sit through before. It was a 10a and flipped class so we watched the lectures at home but then would sit in class and have boring extended discussion time that could have been easily condensed into 30 minutes. The lectures we watched had lots of information but I never felt like I internalized any of it. She would just jump around topics and skim over super complex stuff. She grades super hard and her questions for just about everything are incredibly ambiguous but she's expecting a very pointed answer for everything which I thought was very unfair. I regret taking this class and should have withdrawn. I think she could have readjusted things because so many of us had course concerns that we brought up but she never changed anything besides giving us more time for the take-home quizzes. I think this class needs a different prof :(\"",
            "review 3: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: I've never regretted taking a class more than this one. To be fair, my first mistake was assuming it would be a layup, but from the syllabus she clearly states that you only need experience in a college science course and she'll teach everything you need to know. Instead she teaches as if everyone has an advanced background in biology, chemistry, astronomy, physics, and earth science! So at all times only about half the class could clearly grasp the concepts while the other half was floundering to figure out what in the world a parsec is. I've taken many STEM classes at Dartmouth and this was probably the most unreasonable (which is saying a lot). The lecture videos are obnoxiously long (each topic could have up to 3 30-40 minute parts, and each week could have 1-3 topics), the assigned papers rather advanced and dense for the expected level of knowledge, and class time always felt like it was an hour too long. And the assignments! She created weekly assignments that were supposed to be completed within the two hour period, but 5/6 assignments were so obscenely difficult that the whole class would get through maybe 2-3 questions and then spend 2-3 hours outside of class trying to figure out what on earth the questions are asking. Her quizzes are SO long - people took anywhere from 2 to 6 hours - and the questions are simultaneously so vague but so specific that if you don't mention the exact words that she has in her mind you'll get points taken off. She also told the class that an 8 hour final exam was reasonable and only shortened it when we basically begged her. Again, literally the harshest grading policies that I've ever experienced here. As someone who was vaguely interested in astrobiology, I can definitely say the material was absolutely NOT interesting enough to make up for the awfulness of the course. The worst part is that she's a genuinely very kind person and is willing to give extensions/help if you need it, but her teaching is atrocious. I felt so frustrated the entire term and I can confidently say that the entire class - even the EARS/astrobio people - felt the same way.\"",
            "review 4: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: As evidenced by other reviews, this class was not as enjoyable as we all hoped. The astrobiology material is absolutely fascinating and is part of why I came to study Earth Science. I am still interested in this field but I definitely feel a bit less excited about it after this term. Sarah is a genuinely nice person and I really appreciated her approach to extensions and missing class. It also very clear that she has put a lot of time and effort into this class. That being said, some of the in-class discussion and exercises felt like too much. This class has a lot of information to cover in 9 weeks, so obviously its crucial to get through everything in a timely manner. However, the course load is much higher than I think any of us anticipated and I spent more time on this class than my other two combined most weeks. I do think this class has great potential and can be effectively taught by Sarah. She took a lot of feedback from us and I have no doubt that she will try to apply it going forward in her classes.\"",
            "review 5: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: Yeah... this class was rough. The other reviews pretty much covered it all, but yeah. Rough. We went incredibly in depth into every subject (bio, chem, ears, astro). The prereq was just 1 science credit, yet we went so in depth to every subject (bio, chem, ears, astro) that you'd have to be a quadruple major to fully grasp everything. So most if not all of us found ourselves way out of our depth for most of the class, except for a couple of weeks that related to the subject or two we had prior knowledge in. And I found myself mostly relying on prior knowledge rather than what we learned in class. And the grading. Oh! the grading. For me, this was the roughest part of the class. She would ask such vague questions and yet expect such specific answers that unless you could read her mind, were so difficult to guess what she meant. Even if your answers were correct/reasonable, if it wasn't the exact thing she was thinking of, it's wrong. For some questions, if you get them wrong, she not only doesn't give you points for the question (which is expected and extremely reasonable), but gives you NEGATIVE points that undo the points you get from any questions you manage to answer correctly. Pro tip if you plan on taking the class: if you see a multiple choice question with \"all of the above\" as an answer, IT'S NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE. She'll give you all options that are right, except for one option that is only half-right. Therefore, it's not all of the above, meaning you have to guess which one of the right answers is the \"most right\". The tests felt more designed to trick us rather than test our knowledge. She asked us for feedback multiple times throughout the term, but then didn't end up implementing any changes (besides more time on the quizzes, which was great). Sarah is such a nice person (she baked us cookies on the final day!) and very chill about giving out extensions, however she's still relatively new to teaching and I don't think she's found her groove yet. I think this class will get better in future offerings, however I would not be so eager to test that if given the chance. I really love the subject of astrobiology, however this class made it feel frustrating and I'll approach classes more cautiously in the future.\"",
            "review 6: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: All the other 21F reviews basically hit the nail on the head, so I'll be brief. This class has fascinating topics and Prof. Slotznick is nice. However, the grading is brutal, the workload is very high, and the tests/quizzes/problem sets are often unfair. The course was broken down like this: 3 quizzes, a final exam, a Sci-Fi paper, 6 problem sets, and class discussions. Sarah is not helpful at all when emailing or even asking questions in person and she seems to try and trick students on many exams. There was a heavy chemistry and biology focus in this class and probably the hardest course that I have taken at Dartmouth (I'm a STEM major). I genuinely liked the topics, however the workload, grading, teaching, and classroom environment made me not enjoy the class. A shame, as Astrobiology is so cool.\"",
            "review 7: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: The flipped format of the class was very pointless especially when school was in person. Pre-recorded lectures were sometimes 2 hours long and took even longer to get through since they were very heavy in content. Group exercises weren't necessarily bad - they just didn't always feel connected to the lecture content (if anything, the exercises felt more relevant to the class than the actual lectures). The midterm quizzes were \"supposed\" to take 1 hour but always took me at least 4 hours. There were 3 midterm quizzes (all open-note), group discussions on scientific papers and readings, 6 in-class group exercises (rarely finished in class since they were so long), a 4000+ original research sci-fi paper, and a cumulative final quiz. The workload for this class was absolutely insane and other people taking the class will attest to this. We were always drowning in work. I definitely regret taking this course, not because of its content - the content was great. It just turned out to be SO MUCH MORE work than what was conveyed through the syllabus and the first week of the term. The work would have also not mattered much if the Prof didn't do the flipped format and was more generous with weighing assignments and with grading. the grading felt extremely petty - prof was just looking for places she could deduct points (on the exercises, on quizzes, on the sci-paper draft). I did like the class, its content, and the overall experience - I just wouldn't have taken it with two other extremely hard STEM classes if I had known. The lectures were so packed with information and none of them actually conveyed that information well. Sometimes, it felt as if the prof was just throwing words around for no reason. There was obvious chemistry, earth sciences, and biology focus in the first 7 weeks of the term which felt so alien to someone with no background in those fields. The irony here is that in the first week of the term, Prof assured the class that content was going to be very interdisciplinary and no specific background was required. I feel like this class had the potential to be amazing since the topics were very interesting and the people were also great, just maybe a different prof.\"",
            "review 8: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: This class was very difficult for me, but I think if you are super interested in the field AND willing to put in a lot of work it can be worth it. There are six exercises, lots of reading discussions, three take home quizzes, a final paper/presentation, a take home final, and about 3 hours of lecture to watch per week. This might not seem awful, but this all ended up taking me a lot longer than I think Sarah had expected it to, especially when a lot of questions on the exercises/exams were pretty vague and open-ended (might have been designed this way on purpose, but it really made it take a lot longer to complete figuring out the exact right thing to say). Some of the readings, especially the early ones, were pretty jargon heavy but I think Sarah did a good job balancing those with really interesting papers on the ethics of space exploration and even some sci-fi stuff. Some of the exercises were also interesting (though a few felt pointless), but just a lot of work. The whole class is basically merging biology, chemistry, EARS, astro, and some ethics (like one or two classes I forgot) to study astrobiology. A super cool idea that I was really interested in, but when teaching a class of undergrads coming from different majors, this meant a lot of people felt pretty out of their depth for parts (I really struggled understanding the early course with biology and chemistry of early Earth life). This added to the workload as I spent more time than was expected trying to catch up on those parts. Even though there are parts of the course that I would change, I did like Sarah. She was communicative with us, had a flexible extension policy as long as you communicate (super helpful because I had a lot going on out of the class and she wasn't invasive with asking questions about reasons), and seemed like a really good person. She also took our feedback into account a few times and changed parts of the course (originally the final was supposed to take 8 hours and she shortened it to 3, and it still took me 8+ yikes), but wasn't able to with other parts (flipped classroom). I think if the workload is reduced a bit and more lectures happen in person rather than online, or at least short in person summary/recaps and shorter online lectures, it could be a super worthwhile course, just not sure if that will happen. As it is right now, don't take the course if it's just for a distrib, EARS 30-something credit (other EARS 30-something classes I've either taken (33) or heard about are still interesting and less work), are only sort of interested/testing your interest, or don't think you'll have a lot of time to spend on it. I would probably still have taken the course even if I knew how much work it was because I am super interested in the field/thinking about going into it, I just wish I knew the workload ahead of time and would have taken it a different term where I had less going on.\"",
            "review 9: \"21F with Sarah Slotznick: This class was a lot of work, but I think part of that was simply that this class needs more prerequisites somehow, or needs to be a little less broad (sadly). I really loved this class, honestly - the material was interesting, the labs/exercises we were assigned were often really creative (ex. looking at cups of sand/dirt and identifying whether they might contain biotic material), and the culminating project was a research paper in which we were asked to come up with a \"far-out\" scientific idea/hypothesis and support it using available literature (ex. could life have originated on Mars and been transferred to Earth via meteorite?). The research paper was problematic in terms of time management (we had a normal to heavy workload to begin with, but adding in the research paper made it semi-unmanageable), but was a great idea in theory - I had to learn how to read dense scientific literature outside of fields I was familiar with, but it was overall a great experience and I learned a lot from it. I think if I had not had extensive background in biology and earth science, as well as some familiarity with astronomy (I had taken ASTR/EARS 19 prior to this course), this course would have been a lot more difficult for me. Like other reviews mentioned, the only prerequisite is one introductory science class, which resulted in a lot of people feeling lost during fairly disparate units we covered (sedimentology, bio 12/13-style intro to amino acids and nucleic acids, basic physics/astronomy of spectra and star luminosity). Overall, would recommend going to the first class and seeing how you like it - Sarah's teaching style worked well for me and I really enjoyed the class, but with less of a scientific background or unfamiliarity with flipped classroom, I might have struggled more. Don't take this as your science distrib - it's a 30s-level class for a reason (although maybe it should be 50s- or 70s-level).\""

The structure of the class is many small assignments throughout the term to get you familiar with coding in R. You will analyze different datasets, particularly those of the Upper Valley, so the trends are right outside your window. R can be tricky but Carl does a great job of making the different functions understandable. If you are at all interested in big data, statistical analyses, or hydrology, I would absolutely recommend this class. There is constant work but if you stay on top of the assignments, it can be the most enjoyable work of your term.\""

The course structure was vague, and the lecture materials unorganized. The lectures were 2 hours long without any break and people seemed really tired/zoned out in the latter hour. I honestly felt like it was hard to go to the bathroom in the middle, because the professor would check in on students who disabled their camera to make sure they were there, and no one ever texted in the chat they were going to the bathroom. The slides in the class were hard to follow along because the professor would edit the version he had so ours were not the same as the one he used. I spent a lot of time in class trying to find the lecture slide to take notes. For the pros, it was nice to have a smaller more intimate class. The TA Danielle was AMAZING and so helpful in all the psets. I found the psets hard to do because it was so hard to pay attention in class, but if I referenced the lecture slides it would make more sense. If you're looking for a layup, it's a super easy A.

I've taken other (better) classes with Wil, and I think he's under a lot of stress this term, so maybe it would be better in a different term, but... The structure is theoretically a flipped classroom, but in practice its an asynchronous class with required office hours. Everything is outside class---the lecture videos, the p-sets, and the (long) readings. I think Wil intended class to be when we ask him questions about the lectures / readings, but no one ever had questions (because there's no short quiz or any mechanism to make sure you watched the lectures) so mid-way through he pivoted to having us come up with questions to ask for the first part of class. It's just... not a good use of time. The lectures are also really hard to follow, they're generally 45-60+ minutes long, Wil's handwriting is often impossible to read (and he doesn't use powerpoint slides, so if something he said didn't make sense... good luck). I'm honestly not really sure what (if?) I learned. In fairness, we did a project at the end of class were we reviewed a paper that was related to biogeochemistry, and that was fun, but for some reason he had us record the lectures, which we then watched in class instead of presenting in person.

Try it.\" or to start the doc with two pages that say \"don't scroll down until you're really ready to take this!! Are you SURE you're ready?.\" TL;DR, I like(d) Wil, but I can't in good faith recommend this class to anyone--there are better geochem classes if you want to learn the material. Every assignment felt like it was designed to minimize engagement, and by the end of the term I resented every minute I had to spend on the class.\""

It's very open ended, and you can really do whatever you want. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken! The things you learn are very applicable to everything else. In addition to the final project, you have a midterm, two homework assignments, and four abstract writing assignments where you're given a paper and have to write an abstract for it.

It's definitely a valuable experience if you're going into science (esp a field that requires lots of mathematical modeling) but don't just take it for fun! There are weekly \"short assignments\" (10 minutes if you do everything right the first time, 10 hours--plus talking to Carl in the office--if you're actually a person) that are pretty much all Excel stuff. That's 20% of your grade. Four case study write-ups (7 pages each, basically) comprise the other 80% (each equal). These aren't bad but they are tough because it's hard to follow how the modeling work relates to the case study sometimes, but Carl is really helpful and it's kinda cool when everything makes sense. Until then, it sucks, though. There are also a lot of funky results with weekly labs (yes there are labs but class only meets twice a week and lab gets out in like two hours every time so it's really just 2-4 on Weds and 8:20-9:50 on Fri) and such.

It was also so so hard, but not in a way that I felt meant I couldn't do well if I put in the time. The first midterm was rough, but honestly that material is the most conceptually difficult stuff in the class, and it gets better from there. You don't really ever get a break from the workload--you alternate weeks with midterms due and weeks with labs due--but you learn a lot. (To be fully transparent, I love geochem and I'll probably end up with an A or an A- in the class). It's a flipped classroom, BUT in this class that just means that the reading is required and there are no (!!) p-sets (and Xiahong writes the readings herself, so they're specifically for this class, and it's just the material you need to know). Average class is you take a short (1% of your grade) reading quiz, discuss the answers as a class, and then do in class exercises, which aren't graded or turned in. Grade is from 2 labs, 3 midterms, 1 final (tests are take-home, open notes). The lab grading is tough (going to office hours probably would have helped), but tbh it's pretty fair and she gives really helpful feedback. Tips: Doing the in class exercises on your own to study for the midterms is helpful and doesn't take more than 2-4 hours (keys are posted with the exercises, so you can check your own work, or just look at the keys). Do NOT leave the lab reports until the last minute... IMO you want a *minimum* of 3-4 days (from someone who is very good at working under pressure). You can get extra credit by doing a final project, but you don't have to unless you're a grad student. All that being said, because Xiahong is retiring @ soon, unsure who's going to teach it next. If it's Wil, TBH I'd tread with caution unless he's exactly copying Xiahong's class structure and uses her readings (check reviews for ears 34).\""

It's a lot of work, although it's relatively steady until the end of the term. Labs are almost every week, and are generally pretty cool (really well integrated with course material), although I usually had to spend 2-4 hours outside class to finish them. End of the term was a little rough work-wise, because you take the final week 8 so the last two weeks can be used for work on the final project. The final is take home, open notes, and open for a 12 hour window once you start it. It's not supposed to take the whole 12 hours, although I think how much time you spend on it depends on how much of an overachiever you're trying to be. The final project is writing a guidebook chapter (with a partner) for somewhere that you'll visit during the field trip. The field trip is pretty awesome, you get to go to a ton of cool places, and you can't get graded because it's during break. I think Sarah still needs some practice writing exam questions (they can be hard to interpret) but if more than 75% of the class gets a question wrong she'll give everyone a point (regardless of if you got the question right or wrong). That being said, I've seen her really improve as a teacher just in the past year I've interacted with her, which means that by the time this course is offered again, she'll probably be better at writing questions. Her lectures are also really well done and easy to follow. Overall I would recommend taking this as your ONE (1) hard class for the term--trying to double up on hard classes means you won't sleep at the end of the term.\""

The other hard part about the Stretch is that it started 7 days after summer term ended my year. (2004). Ouch. That was hard. very quick turn around. And the most challenging segment with the fewest days off (none) and the initiation into the world of understanding field geology and stratigraphy came first.

But as a non-science oriented individual, I couldn't really care about what the material covers. But, you get a lab credit for doing a class that essentially has NO LABS!!!!! We had one lab which we actually had to write some stuff on. The other labs consisted of observing rocks and fossils and thinking about them. There are some small assignments like \"in a page, explain the concept of time...\" Seriously, a lab doesn't get any better than this. The only big assignment is a term paper that is 10 pages but is surprisngly really interesting if you pick a good topic. Hearing some of the other kids presentations was actually pretty cool. Moral of the story, despite its lack of entertainment this is a must take class if you want an easy lab. Don't take astro (everyone says its boring and the labs aren't as cool as they sound).

He cancelled class half a dozen times for health reasons, and skipping class/doing other activities like crosswords or blitzchecking was common. the occaisional hw readings he sent out were contemporary debates in the field, not introductory texts, so he pretty much assumed geology, geochemistry, and organic chemistry backgrounds from all the students even though that was obviously not the make-up of the class. The biggest frustrations in the course arose when we actually had an exam and suddenly everyone had to piece together some idea of what his disorganized lectures had been about. a lot of my finals studying involved looking up facts on the internet because it was easier than trying to make sense of the powerpoints.\"",

I was really worried about taking this class based on the reviews I'd heard of Professor Feng, but Carl absolutely knocked it out of the park. The class was centered around the weekly labs (\"Wednesday walks in the woods\"), where you got hands-on experience with the concept you were focusing on that week. The lectures on either end focused on the lab material as well, with the Tuesday lecture giving background and methodology, and the Thursday lecture reviewing what you saw/learned in the lab. Instead of jumping quickly from concept to concept, you really dug into each idea and learned about all of its theory, equations, chemistry, physics, real-world implications, etc. He never shied away from giving you the full picture, such as with the mathematical equations, but rather than making you do all of these complicated derivatives and such, he explained what each part of the equation meant and gave you the simplified version for your own calculations. There was no textbook/readings and the only assignments were the weekly lab write-ups, which followed a format that was more relaxed and about showing comprehension than putting forward a formal report with a specific format.

The course was essentially an overview of the most obscure molecular biology topics which were explained in such a way that none of the non-science kids understood them.

We spent a good chuck of the class on defining life and a good chunk on the origin of life, but very little of it was actually about aliens.

As far as the actual teaching, Scott pretty much just rambles on and goes off on 20-30 minuten tangents that have nothing to do with anything.

He is so oblivious to his audience and the half of the class that had no science background was totally left in the dark. Professor Scott also seemed like he really didn't care about the class. Frequently he would complain about how much work he had in his research projects and was always late getting stuff back to us. He's so disorganized (like when he announced our midterm only a few days before the test) that you're constantly stressed because you never know what's going on. From my anecdotal experience, the grading seemed arbitrary. The midterm was two essays and he left no comments about why he took off points. When I met with him about a paper-grade which seemed unusually low he was like \"What? I gave you that grade? That's odd, I thought I gave you higher.

The entire class is memorizing information, regurgitating it, and then forgetting it as soon as you don't need it anymore. This is an intro class and yet the averages on the 2nd and 3rd midterms were B/B- because for some reason Stroup wants this to be a weeder class for the major.

Most classes had a 45-minute pre-lecture before them, which is basically just an extra session of the class because there is so much content dumped onto you that there isn't enough time in the term to cover it all. The entire class is a giant info dump and everything is centered around memorization/regurgitation \u2014 from the hourlong homeworks (you copy down diagrams from the slides by hand each week) and the daily quizzes (you look at the slides and fill out multiple choice questions) to the exams (you memorize the slides and word vomit and get points off for meaningless shit) \u2014 noticing a pattern here? Also there are THREE MIDTERMS and a massive final, the TAs grade way too harshly given the nature of this class (reminder: this is an intro class for fucking EARS). There's generally this vibe that nobody \u2014 whether it's Stroup, the TAs (who are graduates), or the students \u2014 wants to be there. To make matters worse Stroup is really not a good lecturer which contributes to the whole info dump vibe.

Same with the homework as well -- honestly you just had to copy directly from the slides to the homework to get full credit. Group project is slightly annoying but is completely doable in a day -- we filmed and finished our assignment in about a day and most of the \"data collection\" can be fudged as long as you know the trends. As for Stroup, I thought he was a pretty decent lecturer -- to be fair, I'm definitely a science nerd so almost all of the class content was super interesting for me. I felt bad for Stroup as it seemed everyone lost interest in Week 4 but if you just actually listen to what he has to says, it is pretty interesting and relevant to what's going on in the real world. Also I do think the title of the course is not accurately titled -- should be a more intro to geology course rather than environmental change course (climate change was only brought up week 8-10). But all in all, if ur just looking for a SCI distrib, I think this would be a good intro course. Definitely still one of the easier science layups out there -- don't listen to the fools who say CHEM 5 is easier.

She purposefully tries to make this class accessible to anybody who wants to learn the basics behind all sorts of weather and disasters. It's tough to teach this class without turning it into a math-intensive course with complex formulas and minutia to remember, and Sonder succeeds in giving a basic glossing over of the various aspects. You only had to know basic math (like algebra). There were three problem sets throughout the class. All the information was given to you (numbers, formulas, etc.) on the handouts, so the three question sets took all of 30 minutes to an hour. The one qualm with the class was the TAs. They didn't do much except grade the one paper we had to write. It seems that they realize that any middle schooler with a basic knowledge in earth science could have done their job, and looked to flex their powers by nitpicking on test and paper scoring. They were responsive to questions about scoring, however, so that was a welcome change.

If you just kind of followed along the slides and listened while also scrolling Instagram or playing the Wordle, it was good enough to generally get an A on a relatively straightforward test with a lot of MC. Approximately 150 people were registered in the class period and probably 40 people would be there consistently yet the median was still an A- so still pretty easy for a SCI distrib. Kalin was a nice guy but could be a bit boring. Spoke very quietly and just read off of the slides. There were times when his passion shone through, but generally not about the actual material. He did care about his students though and was always available for questions.\""

            "review 1: \"07F with Eric S.: The choice between sleep and this class was never really much of a choice. After how painfully, mind-numbingly boring these lectures were, you just stop going. It was sad to see how empty it was towards the end of the term. Every day, you have to turn in these idiotic weather studies that have nothing to do with anything, can be done by an 8th grader with a learning disability, and are a waste of time that could be better spent doing nothing. Example: \"Draw a line on the world map where the day / night boundary is\". As it was, that line is placed between the half of the world that is bright and visible and the other half, which is entirely black. What this has to do with weather, I've yet to learn. Also, you have to keep track of the daily weather in a log, which you are asked about on the exams. This is fine and makes sense, but all you ever need to know are temperatures and pressures, so everyone forgot to do these until the exam, so you went online and copied it from a website. A good idea ruined by futility on the prof's part. The class really teaches you nothing interesting, as Posmentier lectures in a way that could put a crack-addicted wolverine to sleep in about 3 minutes. I saw people napping with headphones on in class. The textbook's all you need. You only have to go to class to hand in the weather assignments, so just come at the end and turn them in then. Other than that, the class is a waste of your time. Have the integrity that I didn't to take a proper class. Take something in Astro; they're easy, but you'll learn something. Come on, someone's paying thousands for this. Do something else.\"",
            "review 2: \"07F with Eric S.: If any of the things in the title got you excited, this class is for you! Otherwise, I would advise against taking this course, maybe even if you ARE looking for an easy SCI credit. This class is frustrating in many, many ways. For starters, the professor and the textbook readings are oftentimes not in sync. Our first test, for example, made us responsible for material in a chapter we hadn't even been assigned to read yet. Tests in general were unpredictable, though this got a little better toward the end after he asked us for feedback - the most obscure minutia could be there while stressed overarching ideas could be absent. Fine for a higher-level class, but not for one full of people who came in with no conception of meteorology beyond fog being clouds on the ground. The lectures are dry and boring, and many people seemed to sleep through them, content to get the PowerPoints online. Weather assignments are due everyday, but these are fairly simple and fortunately make up a decent part of the grade. You also have to keep a daily weather log to be used during tests, but this is also easy. Overall, I guess I'd recommend the class for people looking for a SCI, but Astro may be better.\"",
            "review 3: \"07F with Eric S.: Although this class is rather easy, the exams are insane. The average on the first exam was a 62. So it really did not make much of a difference if you studied or not. Posmentier choses random multiple choice questions to make up about half the exam from the book companion, which means that they are ridiculously specific questions generally about things we never discussed in class. Maybe my grade will turn out alright after weighting, but it was ridiculously hard to get a good score on the exams.\"",
            "review 4: \"07F with Eric S.: I took this class because I like the weather. I didn't need the distrib, so I set an NRO and I am glad I did. While I found the material extremely interesting, I thought the exams were not that easy. Other than exams, your grade is determined by a series of homework assignments that are due almost every class. They don't take much time and they're pretty easy. Also, you have to keep a weather log for the term and give a weather report for the class one day. It may sound like a lot, but you don't have to spend too much time out of class. So, if you want to take this class, I'd definitely recommend using an NRO if you can. Then, you can enjoy the material without having to worry about the exams.\"",
            "review 5: \"07F with Eric S.: This was definitely the worst class I've taken at Dartmouth and I don't think I could really tell you one thing that I learned. What really irritated me was that the textbook reading was completely different material from what we talked about in class so when you didn't understand one, the other couldn't supplement it. The exams were completely unrepresentative of class lectures and the reading and the fact that the medians for the exams were in the low 70s exemplifies that no one had any idea what was going on. You just had to memorize the slides and be able to regugitate material that seemingly had nothing to do with weather. Luckily, the midterms are only worth 8, 12, 16% and the majority of the grade (40%) comes from the daily homework which is really easy to do well on. The prof was nice enough but I just didn't feel like we went into detail on anything. I felt like we should have spent some time talking about extreme weather like hurricanes, tornadoes etc. instead of world climates and the daily cold weather of Hanover. I took this class for a distrib but I would recommend taking any other class to get the SCI. This is just so worthless, a waste of Dartmouth tuition.\"",

It's an easy class without too much work to overwhelm you, but plenty of diverse topics from atmospheric history to synoptic-scale forecasting to climate change. Personally, I have given much thought to studying atmospheric science after graduating from Dartmouth, so I welcomed the opportunity to take this class. Unfortunately, it seemed that many people were there simply for the SCI distrib or for an easy class; nevertheless, if you're interested in the subject, I'd recommend giving this class a try.\"",

However, since this was the first time in a while that the course was offered, the teaching was a little rough around the edges. Ponsmentier frequently made errors while lecturing that confused the class. Despite this, he was fun to listen to and relatively clear. The exams were identical to the practice ones and thus a cinch. As for the TAs, one was fantastic, and the other barely spoke english. Recommended for non science types trying to have a relaxed summer and fill a distrib.\"",

Even if you know how to do the homework, which is pretty easy, the TA's have to grade upwards of 150 homeworks so they look for key words. Even if you have the correct answer expressed in a different way, the TA's and Zhao are both stingy with handing out points. The tests are largely lecture based, and you don't gain much from reading the chapters, especially for the amount of time it takes. The class also uses recycled tests so there are about 100 more people showing up for tests than lectures... and most of the mob has the test from the year before which can be word for word the same.

As for the course material, it's interesting, but the presentation of it is not very stimulating. There is barely any homework, but the assigned reading is slightly more common and really helps with learning the material (especially if you've slept through class). He hands out copies of the lecture notes, and they're pretty thorough, and what you don't get in class you can fill in with the book. It's a typical intro ears class, in that it's pretty dry. Don't be fooled by people saying it's a gut, because it actually covers a ton of information, and if you slack off you'll be left in the dark for the midterm and final. He gave us really helpful review sheets for those, though. As for the prof, he seems to like what he does, but his heavy accent makes it hard to follow him, especially when you're fighting off fatigue. Overall, if you're looking to learn about oceanography, it's not as exciting as it looks. It's not exactly a gut, either...you can get your SCI from easier, better classes, like Astro 2.

The funny thing was, the prof tried to make the material seem hard, but it wasn't really. It was just a LOT of reading, none of which you really had to do. I didn't. There are the homeworks, which you'll breeze right by if you're any good at math. (The homeworks really have not very much to do with what's on the test.) He hands out a study sheet before each test, and all you have to do is go over everything on the study sheet and that's 80-85% of what's on the test. f you want the other 10-15%, then you'll probably have to read and re-read everything he assigned, which would probably take like 15 more hours per week (as opposed to the 2 I spent) -- doable, but not recommended.

Unfortunately, a lot of people who take this class are seniors who don't care about it and never show up to lecture. It's a huge class, and it was pretty apparent that Prof. Zhao wasn't really feeling in his zone or giving it his all. His accent wasn't too hard to understand most of the time, but sometimes he just rushed through complicated material and lectures became muddled and seemed unorganized. I couldn't help but fall asleep a few times in class. It's too bad, because he's supposedly a pretty well-like prof in his department, and he seems like a pretty smart, nice, and funny guy. But you can just tell that he sometimes resents having to teach an intro level course. On the other hand, the homework assignments are almost rediculously easy, and the tests aren't too bad if you showed up for lectures and put some minimal effort into studying for them (and there are only two). This class requires very little work, and as long as you put forth just the little bit of energy that it takes to go to class, you'll do fine in it.

The exams (including the final) are way too picky; some of the answers you could only get by having memorized completely the readings' minute details (which is frankly a waste of time). The tests also relied on the students' having done reading that was not even mentioned in passing during class, which ended up being the vast majority of it (also not such a great teaching method). The homework assignments are an utter waste of time and teach you nothing about the material (their connection to the material is at best shaky). Prof. P.'s lectures were boring and monotone, making it very difficult to see any value in attending class. He was generally not open to seeing the flaws in his testing methods (read: very hesitant to curve an exam where the class\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s median was in the low 70's). Additionally, all of the homeworks and exams were graded by the TA's, meaning he really had no idea about the grades at all. Even more complicated was attempting to settle grade disputes over open-ended answers since he didn't grade them originally and just gave the TA's \"broad answers\" on which to do the grading, which was inconsistent from student to student(luckily I didn't have to deal with this). The TA's weren't particularly inclined to help either. The class was a disappointment, although the material can be very interesting.

Posmentier was not an engaging lecturer and would go into tangents quite often; nothing he said in lecture ever showed up on a test.

In Clouds, he gave us the test a few days before hand so we could study from it and have an idea what he would be testing on. In this class, he hardly would say a thing about the quizzes or final before hand, and then THE MOST RANDOM DETAILS would be on the test. If you are looking to fill your SCI, this IS NOT a good way. Everyone in the class seemed to think he was completely clueless and the tests were ridiculous. Oh, and the last Quiz was scheduled after the registrar's \"Last Day to Hold A Quiz or Exam\" date, so he ended up having to make that one optional, but hinted at the fact that not taking it would hurt the curve he gave you. The quiz was on the Friday before finals started, so it just ended up feeling like a fourth final and made finals period hectic as anything. That probably wont happen again since it became such a big deal, but it just shows how clueless he is. The homeworks didnt take very long, and there were only about 5 of them throughout term, but if you dont do really well on them they really drag down your grade.

For some reason, the same complaints you will find about older iterations of this course apply to it now: arbitrary grading of exams by TAs, ridiculously intense focus on memorizing buzzwords and terms without necessarily appreciating their meaning, and horribly boring lectures. Feng's supposed to be a good prof, and a former student of hers recommended I take a class with her. Her lectures for some reason were incredibly boring and didn't help me learn the material. Most of the problem sets were way too easy and as a result most of the class got perfect or near-perfect scores on all of them. We didn't learn much from them either -- the questions on problem sets are nothing like the exams. I wound up reading the textbook and Googling important terms I didn't understand, which turned out to be much more helpful and useful. The exams were graded strangely -- e.g. a westerly wind is one which blows from the west. If you put down \"winds which blow from the west\" instead of \"westerly winds,\" you would get points knocked off for not using the correct term, even though you clearly understood the material. This class was a major pain in the ass, and I would not recommend it as a gut. If you're willing to put the work in to memorize all the terms used in the class and have a good grasp of basic science (especially chemistry and biology), you may be all set, although you will still not enjoy this class.

Learning how our planet works on larger scales (e.g. tectonic, oceanic) is very intriguing and at some places, inspiring. However, Professor Feng was a sub-par professor. The class felt like a high school class, and many of the students acted accordingly; Professor Feng would frequently acquiesce to immature whining over grades, study sessions, etc. Her lectures were ineffective after the fourth week (maybe even earlier -- I entered the day before the deadline and had about a week of decent lectures), rendering even devoted students into states of semi-unconsciousness. I was very interested in the subject, but by week five I was playing Super Mario Bros. 2 on my Mac for entire class periods. A nearly unforgivable amount of spelling and grammatical errors plagued the lectures, PowerPoint slides, and, more importantly, the assignments. Whenever the busywork that constituted EARS 3 assignments became difficult, there was always the question of whether or not yet another typo had been made. In the second assignment, one such error rendered a problem unsolvable and required clearing up through a mass blitz from the TA. The information is interesting and especially valuable to people in Earth Sciences, Geography, Biology, Environmental Studies, and other departments, yet the professor failed to enhance the class or inspire it even slightly. If you find this with a different professor listed, I'd probably say, \"go for it.\"\"",

The prof was really nice and I liked her approach to the subject, problem sets were fun and made you think about the material in an interesting way. Maybe it's better to take a smaller class with here when you can hear her better and there is more discussion.

In COVID times, he did struggle to get his lecture videos up in time, which sometimes made it so we had nothing to talk about during the synchronous meetings.

Verdict: take it if you really interested in earth science, want to take fun class and don't care about grades. Astronomy is a better fit if you want to satisfy science requirement with lab.\"",
            "review 8: \"19W with Erich Osterberg: I decided to take this class to fulfill one of my science distribs, but it turned out to be fairly difficult (not a layup at all). The TAs are fairly harsh with the hw assignments, nitpicking over a few points and the hw actually counts for a lot of the final grade. The midterms are complete bs as they have total recall of arbitrary terms and facts from the lectures. Also, questions often refer to points Osterberg actually says, but doesn't have written on his slides. This makes recalling facts on his exams particularly difficult. The final was also conducted in this manner, with a lot of focus on sections of the course that weren't even dedicated a large portion of time. As a result, the final turned out to be quite hard as well. However, if you can get past having to memorize tons of random info and the awful grading structure (no rounding up and harsh graders), the class isn't so bad. The content is fairly interesting and easy to understand. His lectures are funny and engaging, but can get super dense sometimes (he just dumps tons of info onto you). If you are a major earth science buff, I think you'll enjoy it. If your all-time passion isn't earth science, though (it certainly wasn't mine), DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of work, and even after it all, you'll just get an A- at the end (NOT WORTH IT).\"",

The roughly weekly homework assignments required a couple of hours of outside work for each, and the quizzes and exams were pretty difficult, relying a lot on memorization. That being said, by reviewing the slides and writing down the odd thing or two he didn't put in the slideshow during class, but mentioned, these assessments were fairly manageable. Getting a B+ or an A- is requires a little, but not a ton of effort. If you want your A though, you'll need to actually pay attention in class and study hard for the exams. Professor Osterberg is a nice guy and tried to make the lectures fun and engaging, even if Earth Science isn't really your thing. The only major complaint I have was the grading on the homework. Some TAs were much harsher than others and it showed in the grade book. Points were often taken off for really minor things.\"",

I took this class to \"try out\" an EARS class, and ended up going on the stretch and minoring in EARS because of how much I loved this course. Definitely not a layup, and the homeworks are very time consuming, but if you are into classes that are straight forward exam based and mostly memory recall, you will enjoy it. I'd call it a middle-range difficulty class, not your hardest class of the term, but not the layup you should add to balance things out.

The quizzes, midterms, and final were impossible to study for. Between two books, unnecessarily long powerpoints, and information that the prof says but is not in the slides, I never knew what to study and was usually wrong about what I thought would be on the tests.

If you want to knock off your science distribution requirement, I highly recommend this course. It's very easy to get a B+ or A-, but it's hard to get a straight A because Osterberg sets the bar for an A at 95% with no rounding up. This means that you pretty much have to ace most assignments and get near 100% on some to offset any assignments you didn't do as well on. Still, getting an A is definitely doable if you put in the time and are interested enough in the material. Professor: Prof. Osterberg was probably the best professor I've ever had at Dartmouth. He was the nicest, most accommodating professor I've come across thus far. His exams were also very fair. Additionally, he was always available to chat during office hours. And he even got to know people's names in a class of nearly 150 students. The bottom line is that Osterberg is the best. Workload: The workload for EARS 2 was very manageable. Formal coursework included five to six problem sets, three quizzes (but the lowest quiz score was dropped), two midterms, and a final. I highly recommend putting a study group together for the problem sets and in class assessments. I also recommend using your phone or computer to record lectures. That way, you'll get the most out of the class and earn a high grade.\"",

His lectures were awesome; super detailed, clear. I felt well prepared for the exams and I didn't do any of the readings. Workload: Evenly spaced assignments and quizzes, knew what to expect.

Don't procrastinate on the homework assignments, and clarify questions about the homework with TAs or with Justin in office hours. The final project was kinda fun and quite interesting. In a spreadsheet, we had to simulate energy changes in order to meet Biden's climate goal. It was graded very fairly. However, the subject seemed random- it was mostly about energy policy. We didn't learn any energy policy, so it was difficult making mock energy policy decisions, not knowing if my choices were feasible and reasonable. We had a day on energy (fossil fuels, carbon capture, etc) which helped with this project, but it would've been nice to also have a day on energy policy specifically to inform this project.

The course had 3 quizzes, 2 midterms, 4 homework, and a final energy project (which was pretty straight forward and shouldn't be anything to stress about). I rented the textbook, but I never used it except for one homework, so I would recommend just using the library's reserve copy. The best way I found to study was just go to lectures and then afterwards make flashcards from the power points he posts. There were three discussion classes and everything else was lecture based. One discussions was about a novel he had us read about extinction which was very interesting, and the other two discussions were on a short research article and our final energy projects.\"",

In a 10 page reading he would find a fact from one or two sentences on page 5 and throw it on a ten question quiz. Not big ideas or major concepts just little details. So many minuscule facts you needed to know that studying became a major headache. Lots of trick questions also. True or False questions where if you changed one word in the question the answer would be the opposite. I don't know from experience but I'd imagine there has to be easier classes out there to check off your science distrib.

We learned a lot of real, relevant life information in this class. I'm considering an ears minor after taking this. Will definitely be taking more ears classes in the future.

If you think you are interested in the material, I would suggest finding a different course that touches on some of the same material. Dr. A's lectures are very disorganized, to the point where I took less than a one-sided sheet of notes every class period, and the notes I took were notations on odd things he rambled about during class. Most of the learning I did for class was on Sunday night, because he gives Monday quizzes and sends out a blitz on Saturday night with a ton of hints that you should study in the book (kind of like a Where's Waldo for the information). Luckily, if you study these hint blitzes fairly well, you will do absolutely fine in the class, but actually going to class is frustrating, though necessary, because he brings up random things during class that are often found on the quizzes, or as slides for the midterm and final. The final was an absolute mess - he sent out no less than 5 blitzes with \"study hints\", all the way up until the day before the test. Apparently he didn't write the test until the day before, which consisted of a handmade answer sheet and a few fill-in-the-blank diagrams, because the entire test was orated. Also, he had about 70 blanks on the test and only got through about 30 of them.

The study guides provided do not give much direction, and the questions on the exam are also ultra-specific. In addition, if your figure drawings are even the slightest bit inaccurate, you will get several points knocked off. The attendance policy makes things hard because if you miss a class where an exercise (homework assignment) is handed out and you do not give the prof 2 hours notice beforehand, you will not be able to make up the exercise for any credit. I missed one of these classes because I woke up (hours after class ended) very, very ill and bedridden.

I recommend taking this class if you need to fill a distrib or if you are genuinely interested in the formation of our planet. It is NOT rocks for jocks however, and no easy A.

The workload per week isnt terrible, you have a lab that will take you a few hours, an exercise that may take you 1-2, and five quizzes per term.

I missed a class because I was having medical issues and Ed wouldnt let me come and pick up the exercise because I wasn't in class even though I emailed ten minutes into class that I was sick.

After reading past reviews that it was akin to high school earth/environmental science, I thought it would be an easy class. I ended the term with a D. The main issues are the exams (1 midterm and 1 final) and the attendance policy. I studied immensely for both exams - more for the final - and did not pass either exam. The study guides provided do not give much direction, and the questions on the exam are also ultra-specific. In addition, if your figure drawings are even the slightest bit inaccurate, you will get several points knocked off. The attendance policy makes things hard because if you miss a class where an exercise (homework assignment) is handed out and you do not give the prof 2 hours notice beforehand, you will not be able to make up the exercise for any credit. I missed one of these classes because I woke up (hours after class ended) very, very ill and bedridden. I did not foresee myself becoming ill the night before so I was unable to contact the prof about my expected absence. Therefore, I could not make up the exercise and my grade dropped an insane amount. On a lighter note, I would say that the labs in this class are very easy - if you are listening to the TAs and profs, the answers are usually given to you. It is also an interesting course because I no longer can go outside on campus without thinking about how the Green used to be Glacial Lake Hitchcock.

We had to watch 2 pre-recorded lectures 3x per week (MWF)...each lecture was typically ~30 minutes each although sometimes they could get up to an hour long depending on how much content there was to cover. On top of the lectures, we met synchronously on zoom on Wednesdays and were given a handout to complete with a partner that would be due Friday (though the handouts almost always took longer than the scheduled class period and you would have to zoom with them after class). We had to complete closed notes (~7 questions) quizzes each week on recent lecture material before we met for class each Friday morning (the quiz opens on Thursday afternoons). The quizzes were pretty easy and typically T/F, multiple-choice, FIB, and one super short answer question. There are readings from the textbook but even the profs say you don't have to do them -- all you really need to know is what they cover in lectures. Friday's synchronous zooms were optional -- we just used them as recitation and went over the quiz/asked questions. There is a midterm and a final exam, both of which are open notes and you have 24 hours to complete them (but my classes median on the midterm was still 83% so it's not like it's a walk in the park). Because I took this course with a lab, I also had a 3-hour lab every Tuesday from 9-12 with the same two partners each week. The first lab was awful but it got better after that...some labs required lots of time outside of class while others weren't bad and we were able to finish before the class period ended. The profs are both super nice and I'm not even super interested in Earth sciences/geology but they clearly love the subject so much that it made the class more engaging (which is hard to say for other online classes). The TAs were also super nice and they would basically give my group the answers for lab and on the handouts as well.

            "review 17: \"18F with Meredith Kelly: This class was very good. Meredith Kelly is an amazing, kind, and reasonable professor and the material is relatively straightforward, but EARS 1 is a sizable amount of work on account of the labs, weekly activities, weekly quizzes, and the two midterm exams (as well as a cumulative final, which was reasonable but definitely cumulative). The median for the first midterm was an 83 percent and the median for the second midterm was an 86 percent or so. The graduate TA who led my lab section and graded my lab assignments was a very nitpicky grader though, especially on the typed write-ups at the end of the lab. I worked very hard on my write-ups and sought feedback from my undergraduate TAs but then this particular grad student, who was nearly as good as the undergrad TAs or Meredith at teaching or explaining things, was very demanding. On the contrary, the undergrad TAs were very knowledgeable, kind, and accessible. Overall, I think that my experience in the lab was unique to this particular grad student at this particular point in time in their academic career and is not representative of how EARS 1 labs often are. Make sure to also stay on top of the material in order to minimize stress for the midterms and final exam - The weekly quizzes help with this. Overall, I would recommend EARS 1 if you have any interest in Earth Science, if you want to go on the Stretch, if you are vaguely considering the EARS major / minor, or, if you are - like me - someone who thinks Earth Science is somewhat interesting and wants to avoid Astronomy 3, Chem 5, a Biology course with a lab, or any other intimidating courses to complete the graduation requirement of a science lab. It was much easier than Bio 2, which I have also taken, and I have heard that EARS 1 is more enjoyable than astronomy. Meredith was very kind and she made an extraordinary effort to get to know each and every student in the 50+ person class! She's awesome! The actual content and activities of the labs themselves are pretty interesting as well - some rock identification, some hikes, some usage of topographic and other maps, and some work on Google Earth. But, depending on your graduate TA, you will need to work HARD to earn every point from the labs, which count for 25 percent of the overall final grade. Despite that, EARS 1 is a good class to take, and I would recommend it.\"",

Format of the class: - 9 weekly Friday quizzes on random facts from the past week's material. Lowest quiz automatically dropped. Other quizzes can be replaced with 100%'s if you go to \"extra-credit\" X-hours. - Midterm and Final. All in short answer format. All quite difficult and not necessarily covered in lecture. Memorize your random facts well. - Lab exam: memorize a whole slew of facts about roughly five dozen different rocks and minerals, then be able to identify these rocks and minerals in samples you've never seen before. Not fun at all. Lectures were miserable. Prof. Kelly was good at explaining concepts; she just tried to squeeze too much into 65 minutes. The result was furious typing/scribbling without much comprehension. Prof. Kelly will probably become a better professor as she gains experience and a sense of how much is too much for one lecture. She was good one-on-one. The only homework, for the most part, is keeping up with the reading and studying. If you're just looking for an SLA, this is not the place to get it. It's the worst of both worlds: you are treated like dirt since you're (probably) only taking the class for the distrib, and you actually have to work to get a decent grade. Several people dropped the class after the first exam. Don't be fooled by those who refer to the class as ROX; it's not \"Rocks for Jocks\". I suppose it would be a good class to take if you have an interest in the subject (potential major?) and have an exceptional memory for random facts.

She also takes questions very seriously and makes sure her students understand the material. That said, this class is NOT ROCKS FOR JOCKS. It was a fun class, but it wasn't a 4th class. There was about a chapter of reading in a textbook each night and though the readings were no more than 30-40 pages we were expected to know them fully since every day built off the material from teh previous day throughout the course. The lectures followed the book well, but elaborated and expanded upon concepts. The lab component was not extremely difficult, but the questions we had to answer were definitely detail-oriented. That said, the labs take a lot less time than labs in similar lab courses. You are not often sick of the lab by the time you are done. We also had weekly quizzes on Fridays and we had a midterm and a cumulative final. The quizzes are on class material as are the finals. However, the one thing you can count on from profesor Kelly is that there will NEVER be trick questions. All question topics are covered thoroughly in class, but questions were often thorough. As in, there were not questions that said \"name 2 of the 5 properties of minerals\" Instead, a question might be \"is plastic a mineral? Which properties does it display or not display?\" This is definitely a class I highly suggest. This class and this amazing professor made me become an Earth Science major, for what it is worth.

The labs and exercises require a decent amount of time outside of class/lab to complete, and a lot of my friends found the pace of the class to be a bit fast. If you are a visual/hands on learner and already have a little basic knowledge about geology, the class should not be too difficult though. Regardless, I liked it and would definitely recommend it.\"",
            "review 4: \"22S with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: Overall one of my least favorite classes I have taken here. I took this class because I needed a lab. After spending hours scratching rocks, standing on the sides of roads with neon vests, going on random walks, and standing in streams calculating who knows what I was disappointed. Go find a ASRTO class for a lab. Do not do this one. On top of that the lectures are AWFUL and Meredith gets excited for no reason. She is a freak about COVID and would drive the bus with the windows open in the rain.. I like Ed but Meredith is sometimes so rude. But go to office hours to get answers for the lab if you take it.\"",
            "review 5: \"22F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: Bullshit class. Please do not take it. Meredith is a complete mess and a dictator. she is extremely rude and never listens to any problem faced by students. Edward is an extremely nice guy but Meredith ruins the positivity created by Edward in the class. Dartmouth should never make people like Meredith a professor.\"",
            "review 6: \"22F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: LOVED this class! I took it as my lab distrib and had the best time. You definitely have to put in the work to get everything done, but the material is so interesting and everyone involved with the class is so passionate that it makes it so worth it. My only regret is not taking this class sooner!\"",
            "review 7: \"22F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: BE WARNED. THIS CLASS WILL KICK YOUR ASS. I took this class for the Lab requirement because I'm not a science person and I heard the \"rocks for jocks\" stereotype, thought it would be easier than others. I was wrong. So so wrong. I barely held onto a B-, I fought for my life to end the term with that. The workload per week isnt terrible, you have a lab that will take you a few hours, an exercise that may take you 1-2, and five quizzes per term. THE MIDTERM AND FINAL WILL HAVE NOTHING ON THE STUDY GUIDE THOUGH. THE WORST PART OF THIS CLASS IS THE ATTENDANCE POLICY. I missed a class because I was having medical issues and Ed wouldnt let me come and pick up the exercise because I wasn't in class even though I emailed ten minutes into class that I was sick. The only reason my grade didn't drop to a C is because I begged Meredith for the entire weekend.\"",
            "review 8: \"22F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: This past term was my freshman fall and I thought the class sounded interesting enough - plus, I could get a SLA credit from it. After reading past reviews that it was akin to high school earth/environmental science, I thought it would be an easy class. I ended the term with a D. The main issues are the exams (1 midterm and 1 final) and the attendance policy. I studied immensely for both exams - more for the final - and did not pass either exam. The study guides provided do not give much direction, and the questions on the exam are also ultra-specific. In addition, if your figure drawings are even the slightest bit inaccurate, you will get several points knocked off. The attendance policy makes things hard because if you miss a class where an exercise (homework assignment) is handed out and you do not give the prof 2 hours notice beforehand, you will not be able to make up the exercise for any credit. I missed one of these classes because I woke up (hours after class ended) very, very ill and bedridden. I did not foresee myself becoming ill the night before so I was unable to contact the prof about my expected absence. Therefore, I could not make up the exercise and my grade dropped an insane amount. On a lighter note, I would say that the labs in this class are very easy - if you are listening to the TAs and profs, the answers are usually given to you. It is also an interesting course because I no longer can go outside on campus without thinking about how the Green used to be Glacial Lake Hitchcock. Overall, enjoyed the content - just wished the tests and policies weren't so rigid in nature.\"",
            "review 9: \"21F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: Fun professors who are definitely super passionate about the topic. This class is a comparable to a high school science class, if not easier. Pretty easy, you go through your little lessons with very little outside work. I am not a stem person and I took this to fulfill my lab credit and still did well. Weekly there is a lab which are pretty doable and there is always TA help available, most weeks there are also quizzes. Standard midterm and final tests which were also pretty easy and there are study guides given out. Made some friends here which was great.\"",
            "review 10: \"21F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: If you're looking at this review it means you're probably considering taking this, but even if you're not, TAKE THIS CLASS. The professors were engaging and Meredith in particular got very excited during the unit on glaciers (her research specialty). If you're interested in EARS, this is a great introductory course and considering that the lectures skip over a few chapters in the textbook you can teach yourself more than is presented in the lectures, but if you're not an EARS person you don't even really need to do any of the readings at all to do well in this class - only things in the lectures will pop up on weekly quizzes and exams. The labs are fun and well-structured (the field trips are a nice break from the classroom) and super easy - they literally go over all the answers to the labs during the lab itself so as long as you're listening you're pretty much guaranteed at least a 95%, so it's also a good way to get your SLA and good grades without much effort. But again even if you're not going into earth sciences it's a very good class and you will never look at the ground beneath your feet the same way again. You will regret not taking this class if you had the chance.\"",
            "review 11: \"21F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: Whether you are interested in EARS or just need a lab distributive, I'd recommend EARS 1. The professors are great - very passionate about their work and eager to talk before or after class. The class itself is reasonably structured, much like a high school class, which made an A very much attainable. The labs were also a bonus, as many of them were field trips in the Hanover area. If you put in some time studying before assessments you should be able to leave this class with a good grade and a new view of the outdoors around Hanover.\"",
            "review 12: \"21F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: Despite not being particularly passionate about EARS, I really enjoyed taking this class. The work outside of class is manageable, the labs aren't too difficult, and the professors are awesome. The readings aren't necessary to do if you take good notes in class, so I only had to review the material and work on labs outside of class. Both Meredith and Ed are really understanding and super passionate about the material, I couldn't ask for better profs. I thought some units were a lot easier than others, so the pace of this class felt a little uneven at times because of this. If you need the distrib or just want to try something new, I highly recommend this class.\"",
            "review 13: \"20S with Edward Meyer: If you're taking this class remotely or pass/fail like I did, it's not too difficult and a good way to get your SLA distrib. If you're taking it in person and you're not a science person, I probably wouldn't recommend it. The exams were all open book (but very long), so if you committed a couple hours to them it wasn't too hard to get an A. If they were closed book and during a normal term, however, I think they would require a ton of studying and memorizing. The labs were kind of annoying but definitely got better over the course of the term. Lectures were recorded and sometimes unwieldy, but basically everything in the tests comes straight from them, so take good notes and you're in a pretty good place. Overall: if it's online, take it for the SLA distrib (or if you're interested in earth science); if it's in person, maybe pick another class if you want a layup/guaranteed A/A-.\"",
            "review 14: \"19F with Meredith Kelly, Edward Meyer: I don't know if I'm like missing some gene but for some reason this course like kicked my ass even though everyone says it's \"Rocks for Jocks\" and it's a layup. Honestly I don't recommend this class unless you're a prospective EARS major and tbh a lot of freshman are interested in being EARS majors and then drop it. Don't take your freshman fall. Literally take any other class that interests you and if you still crave EARS in the winter then take it.\"",
            "review 15: \"08F with Edward Meyer: The class itself covers a lot of information, so there were times when the subject matter was interesting and other times when it was not quite so interesting. Professor Meyer had trouble fitting his lectures into the class time, so it always seemed like we were behind schedule. The class is not too difficult and is fairly graded.\""
