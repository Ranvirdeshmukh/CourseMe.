Topics didn't go super deep, though, so although I definitely learned some cool things, it didn't go much beyond the basic level (e.g. on sign languages, brains and language, etc), and class time often felt really easy to the point of pointless, although guest lectures were very cool. Other assignments included 3 reflective essays on readings, a 10 pg final paper that was a study based on preexisting data, in-class (very easy) workshops, and a linguistics quiz that asked a bunch of questions we hadn't learned!

Still though, as long as you do your work, isn't super hard to get an A. Overall, the class was medium - I wouldn't super recommend it, or super argue against taking it.

All assignments and texts are given with purpose, the discussions are well-led, and the feedback I received on my writing was some of the best I've ever received.

Professor Donahue provides a model for peer review that works really well, and I felt that my peers' feedback was just as good as the feedback I received from the professor herself. There are additional reading and writing assignments outside of the essays, but these weren't particularly difficult (you just have to organize your tasks well).

The problem is that he also assumes that everyone in the class has a graduate level linguistics background and he is really hard to follow. I understood NOTHING throughout the duration of the class and because of this doing the problem sets (there are three and each is worth 15% of the final grade) was always nightmare. That being said I did pretty well because the article summaries were straight forward. After ten weeks of this class I barely know what typology is, I am convinced that the whole field of study is meaningless, and I absorbed absolutely nothing. My grade was fine tho and my takeaway was this, if you can get through the problem sets this class isn't hard or time intensive (problem sets excluded they take forever and are difficult) but don't expect to actually learn anything.\"",

Whaley is a super chill professor though, and you can tell that he's genuinely enthusiastic and interested about the material. And even though I didn't super know what was going on a lot of the time (since typology can really investigate any field within linguistics i.e. phonetics, pragmatics, morphology, syntax, chances are you won't recognize at least a couple of the terms he throws around), the class wasn't bad. You pick up a lot of cool tidbits about language and you realize just how much work goes into one linguistics paper. In terms of work, this class is pretty okay - you have 1-2 readings for after each class and a reading summary about all the articles you read each week due Friday, and those are pretty generously graded. You also have one article review (2k-3k words on an in-depth review of an article you found) and a final paper (3k-4k words on a topic of your choice). The only really hard part of the class were the problem sets - 3 of them, total 45% of your grade. They're not graded too severely, but they really, REALLY hard. Like, ridiculously so. On the weeks without the problem sets, I maybe spent around 8 hours reading articles and writing the reviews (I'm a really slow reader so a normal person would probably take like 5), but problem sets would each probably take ~4 hours each. With help. Overall, not a bad class. I really recommend the professor, but typology just wasn't my thing, I guess.\""

It was not overwhelming, and all the assignments were meaningful for the understanding of the topics. It's really helpful to have taken LING 01 before, but Laura also explains really well basic linguistics concepts for people who have not taken it.

Two 6-10 page papers due week 5 and 9, and a 10-20 page final project that could also be something more creative (e.g. podcast). The papers and project could be on pretty much anything you wanted related to African languages, so it's a ton of freedom. Course material: I thought that it was really quite balanced. You start off a little linguistics-heavy, but it's very manageable even for people who haven't taken linguistics courses. By the end of the course, you delve more into language education, documentation, etc. which was really good for a ling major like me who's usually focused solely on the language aspect. Professor: I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Laura. She specializes in African languages, so obviously she's super knowledgeable about the topic. She's also very self-aware (don't know if that's the right word?): about halfway through the term there was an assignment that was a little yikes in terms of perspective and she cancelled it and spent an entire discussion with us discussing the current social landscape, how we deal with prejudices, etc. Also, because people probably want to know about grading, Laura is pretty chill. As long as you do a decent amount of research and write in a coherent, organized fashion, you will do fine. Overall, a really good class that I don't really have any complaints with!\""

We had thick linguistics readings every week \u2013 these were the type that you had to spend a lot of time on or else you wouldn\u2019t understand. Like, it usually took about an hour or longer to read ten pages and understand it all. When there were hundreds of pages to read each week, it wasn\u2019t plausible. Pulju called on people randomly during class, which was extremely annoying. His questions that he expected you to answer were anywhere from \u201cWhere was [insert name of linguist] born\u201d from \u201cexplain your thoughts on [insert complex theory] and how it relates to [insert other complex theory].\u201d The former was bad enough because I can\u2019t remember every single detail on everything I\u2019ve read but latter was even worse and more humiliating because I can\u2019t explain theories on the spot just like that!

There were class discussions all the time but they seemed to be limited, for the most part, to the same four or five geniuses out of about 18 people in the class total. There were two papers. The first one was on a famous linguist; the second was on some aspect of linguistic theory that had to be relevant to the material we covered in class. The problem with the latter was I had no idea what was relevant because his class wasn\u2019t conducive to learning the material. So I just had to wing it (and the impression I got was that many other students did too.)

If anything, it's bitter grapes about not having learned anything in the class.

I don\u2019t know what happened. To be fair though, the professor wasn\u2019t all bad this time around. Pulju still possesses that rare ability to make students stay awake in a 2A by cracking jokes that they find funny \u2013and- are relevant to the material.

There is also a group component where you design an experiment on Psytoolkit based on a research question that your group decides on, you carry it out on your classmates, and then you write an abstract and do a group presentation on it. You also came up with your own research question and designed a study proposal on that: this was split up over the term into research question, first draft, peer review, and final draft (which doubled as our official final). It's really very manageable, and the thing I found odd was that you could almost not do the readings/watch the lectures and still do fine on your projects (unless the topics overlapped somehow). Prof. Wray also never really tested on the material that she taught in class, so in theory one probably could have skated by doing the absolute minimum. Professor: Prof. Wray is really great and so, so chill, and not just in terms of grading and work. This was her first term teaching, and I think she did admirably well in this weird era of COVID. She is also super understanding - one of our synchronous sessions was two days after the election and she literally said \"if y'all want to discuss the election instead of discussing the week's readings, that's totally fine with me\". And she definitely knows her stuff, both about linguistics and neuroscience! Overall, I thought this was a pretty chill class that covers some really cool topics that you might not discuss in some of the more foundational classes.\"",
            "review 3: \"20F with Samantha Wray: Hi, I was the person in the first review, namely, the person who skated by doing the bare minimum. I can confirm that basically 0% of your grade is based on how well you know the lectures or readings; by Week 3 or 4 I'd completely given up on watching any of the lectures or doing the readings and submitted almost every single weekly discussion post two minutes late. The material (what I skimmed, at least) is all interesting, however, should you actually apply yourself. Samantha is a dear though, and such an awesome person. The only part of class I was happy to engage in was the one synchronous Zoom session--the projects and discussions I had with my group and Samantha were a lot of fun. Overall, I definitely recommend. I got at least something out of the class while exerting zero effort, so I can only imagine how fulfilling this class was for all the people who actually tried.\""

You will need to know your IPA well for this course, but the course is small and many haven't met the pre-reqs coming into it. It's not that critical, because it's more learn-as-you-go. Each year this is offered, the language studied changes. In 2003 it was Vietnamese, 2004 was Dinka and 2005 was Khmer. Apart from regular class meetings (the x-hour will often be used), each person has to meet with the language consultant for one hour per week. This is easy to miss, but this is absolutely necessary for a good grade and really not difficult to do. There are two papers for the class, the first one on the phonology of the language, and the second on another aspect of the language chosen individually. You spend your weekly hour examining that aspect of the language. Professor Peterson is very involved with fieldwork, so this is a good course for him to lead. The few lectures are dry, and the reading is not always critical (i.e. skim the Payne chapter assignments, they're a good reference but a terrible read). In summary, this is a course with a workload that is definitely not too heavy. Just attend the classes and give it the old college try, poor IPA skills notwithstanding, and you will do fine.

I also wrote more for this class than I did probably in my entire Dartmouth career up to this (well over 80 pages).

It's a super collaborative environment though and basically becomes one giant group project. We had three papers in this class - one on phonology, one on morphology, and one on whatever topic you found interesting in the language as the final paper. Prof. McPherson is AMAZING.

Because Professor Peterson wouldn't be speaking as much, and we could filibuster the class by adding more suggestions. Those were precious moments for all of us. The work is definitely not easy. Some of the problems he gives us haven't even been solved by actual linguists. So at the end when you're like, well what was the answer, he'd just shrug and go 'beats me'. Can you imagine your calculus professor saying that? Enough to make you go postal with a staple gun. I understand that many things in linguistics have yet to be figured out. But it's not really nice to assign these problems to novice linguistics students who will spend all night trying to find a presumed solution, frustrate themselves until they give up, and then have them come into class to find out it was all a practical joke, there is no solution suckers. It felt like Prof Peterson assigned these because it's what he would enjoy. Please, if you have any self-respect, don't take this course with Prof Peterson.

For the final exam, you could pick between a 8-10 page paper or a final exam (which he allowed people to take in two different dates). While Pulju usually communicates quite clearly, I'll admit that his final exam for 23W sounded like a riddle to me. The datasets would have been less scary if it weren't for the questions confusing me on top of it-- Or so I'd like to think? Apparently they confused everybody, judging by people's comments after the exam itself, and by Pulju's decision to curve the final exam in the end.

But the main thing that made this course so fun for me was the instructor. Prof Pulju is one of my favourite humans in general. He has an incredibly idiosyncratic academic sense of humour, he's very enthusiastic about the minutiae of linguistics, and he is just so knowledgeable about almost all European languages that it's kind of scary.

The homework was easier by far. Also, the main text, written by our own Lindsay Whaley, was better than what we used in morphology.

You only did the readings if you wanted to get pumped for the next lecture or something, but you never knew when that was gonna happen for sure because Prof Peterson was always behind schedule.

The material itself can be pretty dry at times, but Prof. Peterson is good about letting you work with something that you're interested in for the final project, so you won't have to write extensively about a topic that you don't understand or find boring. Overall, this was pretty good for a 20's level Ling class and mostly a matter of putting in the hard time near the end of the term on the final projects.\"",

            "review 4: \"05S with David Peterson: from Dave Peterson. If you've had him before, you'll know what to expect - class discussions that are mostly just him lecturing about some minute detail of the reading, examples from Lai, etc. If you haven't had him, you should know that although his lectures tend to be dry, he is the easiest grader I have encountered at Dartmouth. Every paper I handed in was written in two hours and was well under the minimum length requirement, but I still managed to receive full credit on them. Specifically about this course - the whole point of it really is the term project, which is an in depth transcription of a thirty minute conversation of your choosing. Since this is incredibly time consuming, it is better to not wait until the final week of classes to really start doing it. You will also have to write an analysis on the conversation, the main problem with this is that most of the more interesting topics are introduced later in the term - after the point at which you have to choose a topic for analysis. Overall, there isn't much work in this class, if you break the transcription up and actually work on it over the course of the term, and Peterson's an easy grader, so although it isn't the most interesting class, it's probably good to take if your other two classes have lots of work.\""

Semantics and Pragmantics was a really fun course, and Glinert is a bright guy with a lot of enthusiasm for the subject. For the first half of the term we studied Pragmatics--or speaker meaning, a speaker's force or intention behind his words, what Glinert called on the first day \"the muck and grime\" in which one's words are steeped. For the second half of the term we studied Semantics (though it felt much more rushed)--or word meaning. Glinert assigned three (paperback and relatively slim) textbooks, as well as a lot of reserve reading, so there was a fair amount of reading due for every class. The reading, though, is really interesting. It gives you a feel for all the perspectives on an assigned topic; it educates you in how a certain theory was conceived and its resulting critical reception. Glinert assigns periodic exercises, which we didn't have to turn in. There are two writing assignments in pragmatics (analyze the pragmatics of lawyers' leading questions; analyze your e-mails in terms of their \"politeness factors\") and one assignment in semantics (lots of exercises from two chapters of our semantics book). (I think that the semantics assignment was ill-timed: we discussed the chapters after the exercises on them were due.) The final was a closed-book two-hour-long take-home worth 55%. Ouch! The three assignments are worth 45%. Double-ouch! And Glinert is a pretty tough grader. Yet class was fun despite that pressure. Some of my favorite moments were when Glinert would share something he heard on the radio, some semantically/pragmatically rich tidbit of speech or writing, and we would pick it apart and share our own hypotheses. We've discussed apologies, the meaning of \"AIDS victim,\" the words \"so,\" \"of,\" \"um\"...and the list goes on. I definitely recommend this class, though I wish we could have had more assigments involving the analysis of other semantic and pragmatic curiosities in writing and speech. More assigments paired with the readings would have helped me delineate and better organize the readings in my mind. Take this class, but take it with my grain of salt: not only will you be self-conscious when writing e-mails to ask favors of others; if you ever have to ask a favor of a fellow LING 23 student via blitz...well, you'd better enjoy SM.

This wouldn't be a problem, except that on his homework assignments, Ernst likes to ask you to make connections and develop your own theories about things you HAVEN'T studied in class. The textbook we used was maybe even more useless, because the author jumps all over the place and assumes that the reader is already well-grounded in syntax, providing far too few examples and too little explanation. In terms of the field of syntax itself, there is so much dispute over even basic elements that you could never really rely on anything as fact, as \"This is the way it is,\" because there is always an example of who disagrees. Ernst makes constant reference to such competing theories in class, perhaps to demonstrate his own knowledge, but he results in simply confusing us. More often than not, we were instructed to outright IGNORE Poole (textbook author) because he was WRONG. Then why are we using his book?!

He's such a nice guy, and he is able to make the trickiest topics clear and cogent. This class had a rep for being excruciatingly tough, and Whaley told us on the first day that our class was a \"kinder, gentler Syntax.\" I bet it's true! We used just one textbook, which was easy to read and understand...but it often oversimplified matters. We sometimes learned new subjects that weren't even in the book, so if you were confused you couldn't just trust that you'd understand if you read the book more carefully--you had to go in for help!) There was no midterm or final--just some graded exercises from the book, three problem sets, and a final paper. The problem sets were extremely tough, but you could work with others and ask Whaley questions. I definitely tore some hair out over those problem sets, but I enjoyed meeting and discussing them with lots of people in the class--it was really fun to get to know and share ideas with so many people interested in linguistics and language! Don't be afraid of this class.

The last two sets, which we could collaborate on, were harder than the first two, but the sets mostly took up more time and energy than being extremely difficult.

He was very involved in and committed to the class; he was available in his office or on blitz far more than most professors are willing to be. The work for the class consists of five problem sets, two of which you can collaborate with others on if you want to.

However, this course really will do nothing to improve your writing, and Prof. Peterson's rubric for grading papers (3 possible points in each of six categories, with two \"bonus\" points, for a total of twenty points possible), was questionable. I spent the latter half of the term comfortable in the knowledge that he was a name grader. Moreover, he has partial command of the class at best, and seldom noticed side conversations or sleepers. This was a definite downside when the topics shifted from the immediately familiar slang of college students to more obscure and pedantically written articles on such subjects as the 'in-law avoidance languages of Aboriginal Austrailians' or 'antilanguages,' which many members of the class still believe do not exist. Most of the discussion was dominated by Prof. Peterson and two or three other members of the class. The questions that students were required to formulate were also unhelpful, as many students had queries that really required some level of linguistics expertise to answer well--meaning that aside from the students' own opinions, the questions were fielded by Prof. Peterson, which meant that any differing opinions had to argue with a doctorate in the field.

Four students were required to write a question each on the assigned reading for each class period. These questions would then be answered by the Professor, without any input from the students themselves. The difficulty with this course was that much of the material required more understanding of linguistics than first-year seminar students traditionally have. Most of the articles were written with too much academic snobbery and pomp, and there was little cohesiveness between the various topics studied. The class was easy, and did not require that the student be an excellent writer. Professor Peterson focused more on linguistic theory than writing skills, but even then he was bewilderingly vague.

When describing what the focus/purpose/point of our papers were, she consistently would write 5-7 pages. She would literally go on tangents in her own project descriptions. The topic of my seminar was \"The worlds' englishes\". What does that mean you ask? I still don't know. Apparently there's some challenges in the world when people speak different dialects of english. The whole topic just made me think that linguistics is a useless study, which is a shame because I'm sure that with a different prof and maybe a more engaging topic I might think differently.\""

There are four papers assigned (three 5-pagers throughout the term and a final paper at the end) as well as a few short and painless paragraphs here and there, either in or out of class. As a seminar, it was effective in that it was discussion-based and we frequently had the opportunity to critique our own and others' writing. The only thing I was a bit dissappointed with is that some of the paper topics didn't require much thinking. Nonetheless, Professor Chitoran is very thorough in her reading/commenting on papers, and by no means do I feel they were a waste of my time.

I read all the readings b/c I thought they were interesting but you could definitely get by with just skimming them. We had three research papers (two 4-5 pages and one 8-10 pages). The last one could stem from one of the first. We had first draphs due and then a peer review and then we turned them in. Stanford allways was available in his office though to bring your outline or ideas to and he would tell you if you were going in a good direction or give you source ideas. He was also a pretty easy grader. I don't know how much my writing improved, all though I definitley improved some but I gained a ton of knowledge!!

I thought a lot of the material was very interesting, and you get to learn more about language nuances you had never really thought about. The only stressful part is that Prof Pulji loves to cold call, so it is very important to pay attention in class.

I would only recommend this course for people interested in Linguistics--for those of you trying to get out of taking Math, just DON'T DO IT. Take a math course. Professor Pulju was decent, and he was available, but he makes his tests unnecessarily difficult, and it almost seemed like he was trying to make Ling 1 a weeder course. He is also not very understanding of students who are struggling--he expects everyone to understand a concept (that he usually didn't even teach) and for those who don't get it immediately, as he told me in a blitz, \"Some people get it and some people don't\". The material is very difficult as well. It's very abstract (in my opinion) and a lot of concepts went clear over my head.

How I regret that decision. I must say that Professor Pulju is absolutely brilliant. He is quite knowledgeable about all aspects of linguistics and actually memorized every student's name and face (about 120) and which languages they speak, all within the first few weeks. Amazing. Also, he was always available for office hours which was very helpful. However, this class is a LOT of work. We had problem sets, about 10-12 in total (he dropped the lowest two), and some of them were very challenging - some of the patterns were so intricate and took hours of banging your head against the wall to find. Thankfully, Pulju let us work with our classmates which definitely helped. However, sometimes it felt like he was \"out to get us.\" I remember going over a homework problem in class when he said \"I didn't expect most of you to find that [pattern], and I was right. I like being right about that stuff.\" Our grade was composed of 25% participation/homework/in class quizzes, 25% Test 1, 25% Test 2, and 25% Final Exam. We covered Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Historical Linguistics. The tests are HARD. Be aware that he doesn't really curve. On the first test, he curved some tests but not others (I'd never heard of this before) and since I was above the median, my test wasn't curved at all. On the second test, he said he would probably curve the test but didn't end up curving it for anyone. I should also warn you that the final was ridiculously hard. I walked out and felt stunned. Basically everyone took the full three hours. I ended up doing much better than I expected (I'm assuming he curved our final, at least a little bit) but that final was very, very difficult. Overall, this class basically ate away at my term. It takes a lot of time to understand and grasp these concepts. Even though you think you understand a concept, you will see it on a test or quiz and realize you may not really know it. Another reviewer said that everyone complained about this class 24/7, and that was definitely true. I was told by several people that this class was abnormally hard for Ling 1. Part of the reason may be that Pulju opened the class out to about 120 students (it usually has about 70-80 students). He may have felt a bit overwhelmed (he had to wear a microphone every class) which may have accounted for its level of difficulty. But that's just a speculation. I am actually very happy with my grade in this class - the amount of time I spent on this class luckily paid off. So, I'm not reviewing this class out of spite, but rather to let anyone reading this know what you are getting into. If you are going to take this class, I'd recommend taking it with a different professor, or at least maybe in a smaller class. On one hand, I definitely have a solid knowledge of basic linguistics, but it was not worth the pain.\"",

The workload isn't too heavy, but it's definitely important that you keep up with the material. A large component of the class was practicing the material and if you fall behind then it's easy to be lost in class. The exams were a fair assessment of the material but they still make you think.

My biggest problems with the class were these: Pulju likes to write tricks into the tests, that are meant to make students lose points over idiotic snags in the problems.

It requires keeping up with the reading & being very logical & persistent (& careful with detail) while solving the problems. I thought it was fascinating, but then I love languages... Linguistics 1 is really a zoom through all different areas of linguistics, starting with morphology (breaking a word up into its meaningful parts) and sweeping through all the most important areas of language, ending with historical (although that might change different years.) Pulju's weakest area is definitely syntax. He has philosophical differences with the theory he's required to teach for this unit & therefore doesn't teach it very well. There were occasional times where he really didn't give us accurate explanation on this unit, & I didn't feel that his taking things off on homework was fair. But overall, great course.

Perhaps at the beginning the class seem \"hard\", but after a period of time you will realize the beauty of linguistics - analyzing different sets of language data and coming up with hypothesis is the most fun part.

There's reading from the textbook before each class, but though it helps to read it and it's wellwritten, you can get by on the lectures alone, cuz they're so great! EVERYBODY should take this class, whether they're into math, science, foreign languages, history, humanities, whatever. You WILL love it!\""

            "review 1: \"23W with Lindsay Whaley: I had a fantastic time in Prof. Whaley's class. I'm not sure if he has changed the syllabus or structure of class since the previous scathing reviews were left, because I found the class wonderfully structured and his instruction was superb. Class was interesting and Whaley allowed students to ask questions and really dig into the intellectual curiosities of linguistics. The quizzes were very manageable, nothing unexpected and if you paid attention in class they required minimal studying. Homework assignments took about 2-3 hours working in a group and has a few problems that expanded on what we had talked about in class, but nothing too out of the blue, and working with peers made the PSETs go quickly. Exams were just longer versions of the quizzes and were not bad at all. Overall, it was probably one of my favorite classes of taken at Dartmouth and do not believe that Whaley deserves the previous hate that reviews have given him.\"",
            "review 2: \"23F with Lindsay Whaley: I think for our term Whaley's homework questions were harder than last time he taught it, but overall fairly manageable. the quizzes were honestly pretty easy and you just had to make sure you showed up to class. The exams were also not hard, you could easily study for maybe a day before and you could get a 95+. The thing is the homeworks are brutal. On every homework there was at least 1 or 2 problems that he never taught and even the TAs had no idea to solve (seniors majoring in linguistics btw). Basically you had to guess and just hope he grades you nicely. you absolutely must work in a group or else you're screwed, since the homework sets are like 40% of your grade. Workload wise, however, it's not brutal but not as layup-y as the other review. The content in of itself is extremely interesting though so if you're able to NRO or take it out of interest I would recommend.\"",

Whaley is one of the most incompetent and uncommunicative professors I have ever met. He literally is such a bad professor for LING 1, he doesn\u2019t know how to teach or give us the knowledge and resources to do well on the midterms, quizzes, and problem sets. The problem sets are collaborative, and we were all in office hours the night before trying to understand the problems, because the professor never taught us how to answer things like this. The TAs, to be honest, bless their hearts, they were really trying and sympathetic, but they also did not know what was really going on in the class. Literal. Red. Flag. If the TAs say they don\u2019t know what is going on, HOW CAN WE??? The professor also says so much contradictory information, which makes it impossible to get things right on the quizzes and problem sets. And you might think, oh yeah read the textbook then? The textbook is also contradictory to itself! Literally in one page, it\u2019s like this sound is in the consonant chart, next freaking page, that SAME SOUND is \u201c- consonantal.\u201d How can something be a consonant but - consonantal??This class is NOT a layup, do NOT take this class, even for a QDS distrib. Take another class. Literally save yourself. This class gave me the most stress out of my courseload, and I\u2019m a STEM major for god's sakes. Do not expect to waltz into this class and walk out with an A, because what you will leave with is 1) mental illness 2) no sanity 3) a deep-seated hatred for linguistics 4) a waste of a class.\"",
            "review 4: \"22W with Lindsay Whaley: This was the worst class I have ever taken. Professor Whaley cannot teach. He is nice and very willing to meet with you to answer your questions but he literally cannot teach. Class was incredibly disorganized - he would tell my section one thing and the other section another thing. He constantly made mistakes and we would find them, meaning who knows how many other mistakes went unnoticed. The discrepancy between what we learned in class and what we were expected to know for the problem sets and exams was absurd. There were so many things we just had to know that we were never taught. We had a textbook but Prof Whaley said numerous times in class that he did not like how the textbook taught us and that we should ignore it (but then neglected to explain how we should actually do something). We were allowed to work on problem sets with other people and it took my group (consisting of five people so theoretically it should not have taken us that long) at least 15 hours for two of the problem sets. That is not an exaggeration. Eventually we just started guessing what we were supposed to do because we had no other choice. The TAs tried everything they could to help us but even they did not really know what was going on because Prof Whaley was so bad at communicating. The TAs even graded differently between the sections because he did not have a set answer key. By talking to him I was able to get so many points back it brought my grade up by 3%. That was great, but it was because there were so many grading mistakes and if I had not known to do that I would have assumed I was always wrong even when I was right. The curves were different for each of the sections and the final was so hard he ended up taking an entire problem off of it because too many people were complaining. This is absolutely not a layup. It was supposed to be my layup but it turned into my hardest class (I was taking two other STEM courses for reference). I even read some reviews from years ago about Professor Whaley and thought it couldn't be that bad, but it was truly worse than I could have imagined. Maybe with another professor this class would be better but I cannot stress enough that you should not take this class with Professor Whaley.\"",
            "review 5: \"22W with Lindsay Whaley: Wow. The moral of the story is that I'm eternally grateful that I NROed this course. I would have absolutely dropped it otherwise (and I know several people who did). Prof Whaley is a very nice, chill dude to talk to. Clearly knows his linguistics. But as other reviews have said, the man simply cannot teach intro ling material. Most of the \"teaching\" involved him scribbling a mess onto the chalkboard and just assuming we know what's going on in his head. Newsflash: we don't! None of us have ever taken a Ling course before, and most of us probably won't ever again. Then the problems sets, oh my God. PSET2 took me a cumulative total of 12 hours. Most of it what spent staring at it in sheer awe. It was just simply impossible to do for a Ling 1 student because we weren't taught properly and the textbook was essentially useless. It's a bummer because I could see Whaley being a really cool prof for an upper level Ling course, but he effectively made sure that I'll never take another class in the department. My advice for anybody reading this review: don't take this class with Whaley. Just don't. I don't care if you wanna be a Ling major, wait until this course is offered by literally anybody else. If I can make a single positive difference at this college, I want some random freshman to read this review in a decade when the Ling department assigns Ling 1 to Whaley again, hear my words, and simply not take the course with him. Just wait a term until a competent professor is teaching instead. I hope I've saved somebody from making a terrible mistake.\"",

Medians for quizzes and exams were in the 60s and 70s before curving. I thought I was interested in ling, but this class dissuaded me. Take it with literally any other prof and it might not be so bad.\"",

Whaley does not teach very well, I have to admit. He made a lot of careless mistakes on the blackboard in class and we had to remind him, or else he just kept them there and confused us. However, if you go to his office hours, you will find him kinda helpful there. I liked the contents of the class. I would say that you should be able to tell if you should drop LING 1 in the first week: if you are a ling person and like finding patterns and cracking codes, you're good. Otherwise you should drop it. Some people struggled with the course so much while others had no difficulties. And finally, if you want to take the course, find some friends to take it with you to ease the pain and do the assignments together! This should be able to boost your grade by at least 2 levels.\"",

After hooking us with manageable topics, the class deteriorated into a muddle of increasingly complicated topics, each of which was less comprehensible than the last. I spent more than 10 hours on each problem set, and probably 20 on the midterm. And my grades were horrendously low, unassisted by the linguistic geniuses in the class. I was disappointed- I expected this to be an interesting, fun class. Instead, I barely passed. This is not worth it for the distrib.

Professor Whaley is outstanding. He loves the subject, is enthusiastic, and an excellent teacher.\"",
            "review 5: \"01F with Lindsay J.: Professor Whaley is a great lecturer. Though we were a pretty big class, he encouraged our questions and responded to each and every raised hand. Our grades were made up of three quizzes, four problem sets, and a midterm and final exam. We started off studying phonetics, then worked our way up to phonology, morphology and syntax, with some special topics (on dialects and animal communication, for example) along the way. The problems on the homeworks, midterm and final, however, were significantly harder than those we discussed in class, to the extent that the TAs were always bombarded by students during office hours. I agree that exams and homework should be challenging, but sometimes it got to be ridiculous. I wish that Professor Whaley had discussed more challenging problems in class, if only to open our minds to a greater number of possible solutions. I often couldn't come up with an answer because I didn't even know that such a solution was possible. On the whole, the course was fascinating and made me want to take more Linguistics classes. I would recommend taking any of Whaley's classes if they're offered--he's just a really cool guy in and outside of class.\"",

We did not learn a system for doing most of the homework, thus causing a lot of guesswork. VERY frustrating. The final was unfair. It took too much time. If you were to multiply the time it took by 3 (the typical number of classes most students take), you would have no way of finishing your finals on time.\"",
            "review 9: \"01F with Lindsay J.: From my understanding, many students at Dartmouth who are not \"gifted\" in the arenas of math tend to take Linguistics 1 to fulfill their QDS and avoid Math 5 - the only other students who need the course would be either modified majors, cognitive science majors, or linguistics majors (a minute percentage of the dartmouth community.) I signed up for the course with the understanding that it would be a good deal of work but very interesting - I had hoped to have an \"intro\" to the study of linguistics, the application of various types of logic to dying languages. Under the auspices of Prof. Whaley, Ling 1 took on the characteristics of any other \"weeder\" course at Dartmouth (Math 5, CS 5...courses meant to weed out the weaker links from that department), and as a result, became an incredibly difficult and time-consuming course. From my understanding, Whaley is a great professor for higher level courses, specialty topics in linguistics taught to a smaller group of students, not the 80+ students in Dartmouth 105. Apparently, the class was not meeting Whaley's expectations, and he would let us know about his disappointment with the class' performance on problem sets and other course work. The problem sets became quite the effort - the workshops meant to help cement the concepts were not very helpful. The issues were glossed over, and then the data/problems in the problem sets were much more difficult and complex than the ones briefly presented during the workshops. I was spending about 8-12 hours on each problem set, even when working with other students - I shudder to think of how long it would have taken me to do it alone. The final was another story, given out on the last Monday of classes, due that Friday at 9:30 am - this would have worked out so well had I not had any other work to do during finals period - the amount of time devoted to this \"take home\" final seriously interfered with my work for other courses. Lectures were not very helpful - Whaley was very enthusiastic to answer students' questions, but was so eager that the actual lectures got sidetracked, and we would spend about 25 mins of the class time on that day's actual topic. All in all, this intro course became an incredibly difficult and time consuming course, and it did not help to have a professor berating the students for not doing \"really well\" on the assignments. The grading was incredibly strict. If you're looking at Linguistics 1 as an option for your QDS - please take this into account...it might be more trouble than its worth.\"",
            "review 10: \"01F with Lindsay J.: I really enjoyed this class, but I can see how some people found it really difficult. It really works well for people who are logical thinkers. I found the problem sets to be like puzzles to figure out. But I guess they did take a fair amount of time and were especially frustrating for people who put a lot of time in and ended up missing a lot. One other thing that made the class kind of difficult was that it was hard to know exactly what was expected and what you were supposed to do for each assignment.\""

If you've literally never encountered anything about language or linguistics before and just want to fulfill QDS, then you will most certainly grow to appreciate it.

The workload is fairly light, with five homeworks and five quizzes in the course of the term, as well as the usual three exams, and most of the content in the assignments is precisely stuff from class, so it's not a pain to get through at all, while still being interesting and intellectually stimulating.
