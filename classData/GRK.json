You dive super deep into each text (this term we read Mark, Galatians, 1 Peter), examining things at an almost verse by verse level. The three essays are all really interesting to write and make you consider things you probably haven't thought about before even if you're pretty familiar with the NT. There is also a translation project (which was probably my favorite assignment I've done at Dartmouth) where you pick a short chunk of verses from anywhere in the NT and write your own translation with a commentary defending your decisions, which can be super fun if you pick a passage whose translation has historically been controversial. There's also a film review, which I kind of disliked, but it's easy. For the final paper, you basically can write about anything related to the NT / early Christianity, which can be fun if you pick something cool. When it comes to these written assignments, Whaley seems to appreciate comprehensiveness so make sure to cover all the bases you can when writing about a passage rather than only focusing on a few examples, and don't be afraid to exceed the word limit. As far as upper level language classes go, Biblical Koine is probably the easiest dialect/genre you will read here, especially if you've read any of the NT in English before - heck, I took this class at the same time as Greek 3 and found everything readable. Would definitely recommend taking this class - would be a shame to leave without doing so.\""

            "review 1: \"07F with Antonia Syson: This class is ridiculously fast-paced, but not all that difficult as long as you stay on top of things. At times, it can be hard to keep up with everything, and nearly impossible to retain everything, just because it moves so quickly. Although the class is a 9, Antonia Syson somehow manages to keep her energy level high with her embarrassing (yet somehow inspiring) acting out of in-class reading exercises.\"",
            "review 2: \"07F with Antonia Syson: Prof. Syson is a bright and cheerful lady (even remarkably so while acting out Greek at 8:45 AM), but her class becomes monotonous and tedious at times. The homework consists of ten Greek to English and five English to Greek sentences due four times a week plus memorization for frequent quizzes. This isn't so bad when you are only supposed to know twenty words and one verb tense, but the class progresses so quickly that there's little to no time to reinforce old concepts before taking on the new. The format is the same--using the textbook for homework and quiz prep and using a different reader in handouts in class--basically every day. Also, as in most beginning language classes, every single x-hour was used. Prof. Syson introduced what was in the text for maybe ten minutes each class period, and the majority of the time was spent reading as a group. A lot was left to personal learning from the text, and the workload to keep your head above water is a bit much at times. However, the quizzes usually mimic the homework exactly, and it's not hard to do well on them. After dropping three and only having to take a 15% final (which was a relief during finals week), in the end the quizzes don't look that bad even if they are a lot of work during the term.\"",
            "review 3: \"07F with Antonia Syson: I really liked Prof Syson. While we were all half-dead at 8:30 in the morning, she was bouncing around acting out the Greek and really getting us into it. I loved the in-class readings that we did; I feel like they really consolidated my knowledge of Greek. And as annoying and embarrassing it was to read the Greek aloud, I feel like that also helped me to feel comfortable with the language. If you've got to learn ancient Greek, this class is the way to do it.\"",
            "review 4: \"07F with Antonia Syson: Syson is a load of fun and a great intro professor. Having never taken Latin I was a little more lost than many of the other kids in the class, but the prof made it easy to understand the material. No midterms and an extremely easy final, but a lot of quizzes that make attending class regularly a must. Overall though, Syson is very understanding and flexible about abscences. Work-wise there is little homework but to get a good grade a lot of memorization of vocab and verb tenses are required. Interesting for a term if you just want to try it out, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those not interested in being Classics majors.\"",
            "review 5: \"07F with Antonia Syson: Professor Syson is wonderful - always energetic, and extremely helpful outside of class. She doesn't always spend enough time in class going over the grammar we're supposed to learn that day, but she was always willing to explain stuff in greater detail during office hours. You really need to spend time studying - just doing the homework is not enough to learn the material. There were 10-15 sentences to translate for each class, and it was really tempting to rely on the vocab lists and verb charts in the book. This approach won't prepare you for the quizzes, though. We spent a lot of time doing readings / translations in class. These were helpful for learning what concepts we should worry about the most, and it was encouraging to be able to read Greek so early on in the class.\"",
            "review 6: \"07F with Antonia Syson: Professor Syson is great! She's engaging even at 8:45 and makes Greek mildly interesting. There's daily homework for this class which you really should do, even though it doesn't count for your final grade. Quizzes twice a week and a final at the end. Since Greek is done in two terms, the pace is very fast, and you're expected to learn your grammar very well. It's worthwhile to learn all the vocab when it's assigned so you don't get stuck learning several hundred words at the end of the term.\"",
            "review 7: \"06F with Antonia Syson: I pretty much picked Greek at random; wanted to try something new. Its a difficult language, but there was something fun about memorizing declension after declension and verb form after verb form. Know what you're getting into. Its a lot of work and don't do it if you don't have an hour or two a day. If you're in it to get rid of the language requirement quick, take Latin. Also, 9 can feel really early. Prof. Syson is very very animated in class. She's a nice person, and she has a cool British accent. We do this thing where she goes around making each person translate a sentence of a reading. It's fine if you're good, but if you're unsure it can really suck. She makes it rather clear how she thinks you fit into the rest of the class in terms of ability and preparation. She might be trying to be nice to people who enjoy the translations less, but it can be pretty demeaning. The grading isn't bad. 17 quizzes - 2 a week - worth 75 percent, and 1 exam. You get to drop the 3 worst quizzes, and if you miss one it counts as a drop. She tells you what's on the quizzes in advance, so you know what to study.\""

            "review 1: \"05F with Lindsay J.: Most intense class I have ever taken at Dartmouth. I spend 2-3 hours of homework/studying every night minimum, 5-6 at the beginning. If you can make it past the first half of the course the second half is much better! Prof Whaley is an awesome prof, he knows the material is hard and the pace is fast but still challenges the students to press on and we learned an incredible amount in 10 weeks because of it. Bottom line: You better WANT to learn Greek, you better have the time to study it, and to keep your sanity you must have a sense of humor when receiving your quiz scores.\"",
            "review 2: \"04F with Lindsay J.: ...which means tons of memorization. The pace of the course is a bit fast, as you whip through new tenses/voices/long paradigms without stopping to catch your breath. Other than that, it's Greek one. Beware of chasing horses off the road into the countryside! (And other such oddities)\"",
            "review 3: \"04F with Lindsay J.: Greek 1 was very hard. At times, it was very frustrating. But Prof. Whaley was awesome. He's a really nice, helpful, friendly guy who made the class enjoyable. The class was paced quickly and there's a lot to learn, but it was also a small class with a good prof.\"",
            "review 4: \"04F with Lindsay J.: Word to the wise: don't get behind. There's no time to catch up.\"",
            "review 5: \"04F with Lindsay J.: This class is definitely a lot more work than your average class. If you've never studied a language like Latin or Greek before, the first half of the class will be a lot of work just getting the concepts down. The entire class is very fast-paced, and you should expect to spend significant amounts of time every day studying and doing your homework to keep up. With that said, it is a great introduction to Greek, and you come out of it with a firm grasp on the essentials of the language. Professor Whaley is an excellent instructor who keeps very good track of where each student is in the class and making sure they are following. In summary, don't take this class if you're looking for an easy way to fill your language requirement, but if you really want to learn Greek, this is an excellent class, but a lot of work.\"",
            "review 6: \"04F with Lindsay J.: Always remember that there is a pretty brisk pace to this course, and missing a class most definitely means missing a lesson. If you are interested, it's definitely helpful if you are quite familiar with the differences between the verb tenses and general cases. Prof. Whaley is a great resourse with an obviously impeccable memory, but you need to know that you need to invest a good amount of time into memorization and review. The class is somewhat laid back, but always come prepared.\""

            "review 1: \"07W with Hakan Tell: If you need to satisfy the language requirement, Greek is great because there is no drill and you only need two terms of it. However, the material is very fast-paced and you really need to stay up with the homework in order to do well in the long term. The regular quizzes weren't overly difficult, but you definitely need to put a good amount of work in for this class. Professor Tell is great and makes the subject totally worth learning. He really loves to teach and read Greek and is a good resource. Even if you're unsure about this class, take it with him because he really cares about each student doing well.\"",
            "review 2: \"07W with Hakan Tell: Greek 1 was a very intense class...we learned about 2/3 of Greek grammar in one quarter. But Professor Tell was a great professor and tried his best to be available outside of class for those students that needed extra help on a particular lesson. If you need an easy class, I would not recommend Greek 1. Take it because Greek is interesting!\"",
            "review 3: \"07W with Hakan Tell: The course isn't as bad as it's made out to be, but expect to do plenty of work outside of class. Professor Tell is one of the nicest profs at Dartmouth.\"",

            "review 5: \"05W with Hakan Tell: This was a fantastic course! Professor Tell was great. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, especially Classics majors who need Grk or Lat 3 as a prereq. Advice, however: if you take this class, treat it as 2 courses. Take only ONE other course, not two.\""

            "review 1: \"21W with Jennifer Lynn: Professor Lynn is the best introductory language professor in the classics department, full stop. Greek is hard, make no mistakes about that, but Professor Lynn wants students to succeed and leads classes very effectively in the zoom era. Biggest piece of advice for this class: go to Helpdesk. Guaranteed A on the homework, and your greek will be better because of it.\"",
            "review 2: \"21W with Jennifer Lynn: This class is very, very work-intensive. You learn all the material outside of class via recorded lectures, and then in-class time is small-group work on assignments. Professor Lynn does a great job of making a very difficult class as enjoyable as it can be, and is all-around a great and approachable professor. There's a lot to be gained from this class if you're passionate about Classics and language, but I recommend that you take it during a term which is otherwise pretty easy for you, since this class meets 4 times a week and gives out 3-5 hours of work every night. I would also recommend that you take it after taking Latin, since Latin provides a much easier introduction to many of the complex linguistic systems of Greek.\"",
            "review 3: \"21W with Jennifer Lynn: I've spent at least 10 hours per week doing just homework for the classes. If you count memorization of different verbs and nouns forms it will add extra 5 hours. It starts easy but after the week 2 you will feel like the load is piling up. I took CS1 and GOV class in the same term. I have spent majority of my free time doing Greek. Dare to take it.\""

Greek can be tough though, and even though this isn't Intensive and we stopped earlier in the textbook than she had planned, this class covers a solid amount of content at a quick pace, so be prepared to memorize a lot. But if you like learning languages, it can actually be pretty cool, and if you stick with it, you will learn a lot.\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with Florencia Foxley: This class was awesome. It was super small and filled with people who were there because they were ready to do the work. Professor Foxley is great; she really really cares about each of her students doing well and gives extra attention and opportunities to make up points to students who are struggling. We had a mini quiz every day, a larger quiz about once a week, three exams that would replace the larger quiz for that week, and a final. We also had nightly homeworks. This class is a ton of work and will take up a lot of your time and energy. If you put in the work, you will do well, but if you get behind it will be very difficult to catch up. Because it's accelerated, it moves very quickly. We learned hundreds of vocabulary words and much of the basic structure of the language in only one term. Words in ancient greek change a lot from endings and augments, and frequently become hard to recognize because of this. If you are going to take this class, it should be your hard class for the term. Do not take this class when you're going to be splitting your time between it and a very difficult stem class for example. Do the work, go to office hours, utilize greek help desk, and study with other people. Make a study guide that you add to every day with all new words and forms, and you will be fine. Don't expect this class to be a layup, and recognized that accelerated means accelerated. Take this class - it's great.\""

            "review 1: \"08F with Katherine Kretler: This is one of the best language classes I've taken in Dartmouth. Professor Kretler is very didactive and energetic! Furthermore, she is also strict. For example, she insists that the student should pronounce Greek with the correct sounds and accents reconstructed linguistically rather than simply let the student go along with the \"American pronunciation\". She also insists that students should read Greek aloud, and one of the task of the term is to recite a piece of poem aloud in front of the entire class. And wonderfully, all students read Greeks just the way Homer himself did! (She made sound tracks for us to imitate though) Generally, Greek is much harder than Latin. (My friend agrees with me, and we both got \"A\"s). The verbal forms grow \"exponentially\", yes literally, 2, 4, 8, 16... And the contracted verbs... The Greeks simply made so many exceptions in there language! You must really put tons of works in order to get a ideal grade for your quizzes. There are quizzed for almost every week, but not everyday though. You are expected to DO your home works! (never lag behind!, the textbook's title is INTENSIVE GREEK, and it means it) The mid-term is a fairly easy one, yet the final would be much harder. But, have fun if you are really devoted to it. After all, that's the only way to get ideal grades. Take it with Kretler! She really makes a differnce!\""
