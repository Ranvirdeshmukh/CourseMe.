If you're a chem major not planning on grad school in chemistry, go to any length to find a culminating experience other than Chem 67. After ten weeks of this course, I regret having chosen the chemistry department to major in at all. I entered with average expectations for the course, having had Professor Kull previously and having been satisfied with his teaching in Chem 41. However, this course lacked direction and the problem sets (format of class was four problem sets instead of exams) absolutely did not reflect what was \"taught\" in class - and I use the word \"taught\" with hesitation. The lectures themselves weren't bad, and Kull's were actually pretty interesting, but in the end proved to be entirely useless. Wilcox's lectures were uninteresting to the point of inducing tears. The problem sets took around 40 hours to complete each, and the professors were kind enough to assign one during the final week before reading period - in addition to a 24-hour problem set for the final exam. Oh yeah, and you couldn't get help from anyone except the professors, so don't even think about talking to the grad students. Lest I sound like a disgruntled loner, the sentiments I am expressing were those of the majority of the non-grad-school bound students in the course. The course was basically presented as a survey of different spectroscopic techniques for learning about the structure of proteins. It might have some relevance if you're going in to the field, but if you're pre-med, chem 67 will be the least applicable course you will ever take. If you want to enjoy your senior year, avoid Chem 67. This is truly a course that would be worth the trouble of restructuring your major to avoid.\"",

Your grade depended on 4 take-home problem sets that you have a week to complete. First of all, both profs are very disorganized, which was frustrating, because they got off schedule, leaving a problem set at the very end of the term, along with two lab write-ups. The lectures were sometimes interesting, sometimes really really dull. Both profs attempted to apply the techniques to real life, which shows up in the problem sets. Kull's grading sometimes seemed unfair and arbitrary.\"",
            "review 3: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: I think the problem with this class was that the profs tried to cram so much information into the course that they had to go over a lot of stuff very quickly. So there wasn't much time to go over and review things we had done but no one understood. A review session or two during the term would have been nice, but the profs obviously thought that we couldn't afford to spend the time going over old material. Most of the material is very specialized too, so it's hard to find helpful resources outside of class (the text book van Holde was atrocious). You're graded on 3 take home open book problem sets (usually you get ~1 week to do it) and lab reports from about 5 or 6 labs. Also you get a 24 hr take home open book final exam. All of these problem sets and lab reports are very time consuming. It was probably the most work-intensive chem class I took (edging out 61). There's also no way to really prepare for the problem sets as there are no \"assigned homework problems\" or anything. So you're pretty much thrown into the fire for the problem sets. Granted it is open book. In all fairness, Kull's material was pretty interesting (protein structure, etc). However, his lectures were usually rushed and somewhat disorganized. It was also hard to get a hold of him outside of class, which made problem sets all the more difficult since you can only talk with profs about them (no TA's). Wilcox pretty much talked about various lab techniques one could use as a physical biochemist during the 2nd half of the course. I didn't care much for this part of the course. In summary, I wouldn't recommend this course. It may prove useful to those interested in going to chem grad school, but it's not really helpful for pre-meds. However, since you're probably a chem major, you might have to take this course anyway as a culminating experience. The course has undergone a lot of change over the past 3 years. I think this is Kull and Wilcox's first year teaching it. Hopefully for your sake the course will undergo a lot more change by the time you take it.\"",

            "review 6: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: This class is one of the two worst classes at Dartmouth. To begin: The lectures were not organized to follow the text in any fashion at all (the text is useless anyway) and there were no practice problems assigned. Basically, for this terrible course, you go into lecture (all x-hours included) and listen to a prof talk about stuff that you will not understand. You have no way of bettering your understanding of that material unless you attend office hours habitually. Attending office hours is pretty pointless though because all of the exams and things are take home. The take home \"problem sets\" turn out being questions about things that are only extremely tenuously related to what was covered in lecture. When this class is taught by Kull and Wilcox, you will be forbidden to collaberate on the problem sets and labs with your classmates. Whenever Anderson taught it, you could work together. Completing the problem sets is near impossible. I remember one the questions asked us to prove some mathematical equality that required us to go back and look up all sorts of garbage on taylor series expansions. It had nothing to do with anything. Many of the problems were written with mistakes or without enough information. In office hours, your questions are answered in the most circuitous and equivocal manner possible. You will be completely frustrated by them. Although the problem sets of both professors are thoroughly bad, Wilcox's seem less bad. That is the closest thing to a compliment that I can say about this course. Oh and I almost forgot. The final exam was 24 hours of no sleep hell. What a stupid way to give a test. You are required to check out an exam and complete it withing 24 hours. In order to answer all te problems you have to go through and read countless confusing journal articles, tear through the index of your text referring to many many random topics, and pull what you thought were irrelevant details from your notes. You fingers will hurt from typing that stupid thing. I think in the end my final exam was over 15 pages long or something like that. 24 hours to type 15 pages of crap all by yourself in your dorm room. You wont have time to sleep, and if you take a break to eat, you will be pushing it. One of the other reviews I saw said that it would be worth restructuring your major to avoid having to take this course. Well, I would agree but only because there is a very good chance you will have to take it with these same two professors. If Anderson had been the prof, I am almost postive this would be a good review. I dont know what else to say. This course has been lousy no matter how you look at it.\"",
            "review 7: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: The fact that this course has not existed for long and had not been tought before by these professors was very apparent. It was not well organized, and the objectives weren't clear. The labs did not fit in well with the lectures and seemed forced - is there a reason that every chemistry course has to have a lab component? Most frusturating, however, was the lack of regular office hours set by the professors and the compete inavailability of both of them. They really seemed apathetic about teaching the course. The most engaging moment of the entire term was the guest lecture by Professor Cantor, who should be made king of the department and of the college. He is a genius and an incredible person.\"",
            "review 8: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: This is the absolute worst class I've taken in the Chemistry department (with Chem 62 coming in as a close second) and one of the worst classes I've taken at Dartmouth in my four years. I entered the term excited about the course material, but instead began hating my major two weeks into the term. It's disappointing that the last chemistry course I chose to take ended up making me regret ever being a chemistry major after I spent all of sophomore and junior year absolutely enthralled by the major. Take chem 87 or find another way to get your culminating experience -- this class was terrible! The lectures by both profs were disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. I was unmotivated to attend class, and had to force myself, which is a complete change from previous years of engaging chemistry courses. Both profs are infuriatingly difficult to track down for any help, and the book is one of the worst that I've used for any chemistry course. The worst aspect of the course was the structure and format, which required take home, open book problem sets as opposed to exams. It sounded like a great idea initially, but ended up being one of the most agonizing experiences of my time at Dartmouth. The problems on the problem set have almost no relevance to the material presented in lecture, and I ended up using google more than either my lecture notes or the textbook (which, did I mention, is a horrible jumble of convoluted and impossible to understand jargon?). The profs (Kull especially) take off points in a manner which seems completely arbitrary, deducting substantial points when you don't write about things that the questions never actually asked for. It's like a Bio class in that you should write everything you know about something so that you don't lose points for leaving something out, despite never having been asked it in the question, and losing points on every problem. The problem sets (and the first, awful computer lab) take over your life, and I spent three or four days straight of doing absolutely nothing but chemistry and still found myself struggling to finish the problem sets. The profs were also kind enough to penalize the students for their lack of organization and getting behind in the course, and we ended up having a problem set and two lab reports the week before finals, right before a nightmarish 24-hour take home final. One last word about the final -- the 24 hour take home final ended up being longer than the week long problem sets we were assigned. Right before the exam, several of my classmates speculated on how the profs couldn't expect us to stay up all 24 hours for the take home, but the actual exam revealed the unpleasant surprise that getting even a few hours of sleep during that time period (I slept about 4 hours) will put you in danger of not finishing the problem set. This is the first year Kull and Wilcox taught the course -- I hope that you have different profs when you take it.\"",
            "review 9: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: This class was the most egregiously awful class at Dartmouth. I really, really, REALLY HATED IT. I am not trying to exaggerate how terrible it was. If anything, the other reviews are toned down compared to the kind of student feedback I heard outside of class. Not a single person I talked to liked the class. Even the most positive students were hard-pressed to pick out any good qualities about the class. The other reviews provide testament to how poorly structured and organized the class was. For the last two weeks of the term, we had two problem sets and two lab reports. Consider this: each problem set requires about 30-40 hours of work each week to finish and involves Internet searching, multiple-textbook searching, article reading, etc. Much of the time the material that you are graded on is never covered and has minimal relevance to class topics. Oh, the grading. ARBITRARY. ARBITRARY. ARBITRARY. I attended every single lecture and still, I did very poorly. As for the ridiculous amount of work left at the end of the term, one guy in the class raised in hand and tried to protest, and was immediately (and condescendingly) dismissed by Wilcox. I heard my peers talking about it after class and they were all really, really pissed off and stressed out. Here's an idea for next year: PLAN THE COURSE. By the way, the professors are: a) boring b) unavailable outside of class c) completely unresponsive to student feedback d) all of the above One of the worst things that I heard people complaining about though (and I agree) was that unnecessary changes were made to this already difficult class. When the course was offered previously, problem sets were collaborative. Lab writeups were either optional or not graded. This year, we had labs every week, along with long lab writeups. Also, this year, problem sets were strictly independent work, and we were forbidden to ask the TAs for help. Combine this with the absurdly long and hard nature of the problem sets as well as the unavailability of the professors outside of class, and you've got CHEM 67!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a crying shame that this awful course was the last course of an otherwise (mostly) great major. It made me so furiously angry to have to sit through this hellish class. It made me want to puke.\"",
            "review 10: \"05W with Dean Wilcox: Overall I thought this was a very interesting course. Both professors attempted to make the material accessible and were more than willing to explain things inside and outside of class. The two texts used were both very good and provided clear and thorough descriptions of many protein topics at a level above an introduction. I would have liked to have seen less review of the basics from Chemistry 41 and a more in depth treatment of ligand binding and control of protein function. The problem sets were thought-provoking and truly required application of the material, not simply looking up an answer in your notes. The final case studies were a great way to end the course. It is very unfortunate that a number of students who took this class expected it to be a simple exercise in regurgitating facts and did not feel like they ought to be required to think. Admittedly, this class is harder and more work than an intro level class, but then again, it has never claimed to be an intro level class. As part of the culminating experience for the major, this class should (and does) bring together different aspects of chemistry to achieve a complete picture of the complex system that is biological chemistry.\""

            "review 1: \"23W with David Glueck: Whoever said this is better than orgo is a liar. It\u2019s so much worse. If you thrived in orgo, and generally consider yourself well above average in chemistry, you will probably do okay in the class. If you enjoyed orgo but didn\u2019t get an A or are thinking \u201chmm this sounds really interesting\u201d, do not take this class. As far as chemistry faculty goes, Glueck is objectively good. He\u2019s super kind, lectures clearly and consistently and is always available for office hours. The first part of inorganic is very very steriochemistry, bit its much more interesting as you get past the first exam. However, the exams are literally insane. Our medians on the midterms were both roughly 65, which is in a class of chem majors and minors. And realistically, the medians were only that high because Glueck is extremely generous on partial credit. Every exam felt like I was just gambling with god. There\u2019s no way to prepare or realistically even improve. The exams made me regret ever taking the class in the first place. Thankfully, Glueck does curve generously, so as long as you don\u2019t let the performance destroy your self confidence and you\u2019re content getting a B if you aren\u2019t a chem superstar, then it\u2019s probably ok. Lab are the most chill part of this class. They are just some variation of mix and boil every time, and the lab reports are just answering the questions in the lab manual. They take a few hours, but you can always ask for help so they are not difficult. Overall, do not take if you aren\u2019t willing to slave over chemistry and get wrecked. If that sounds ok, then the class does have some interesting material. However, do not take this class or any class in the chemistry department, unless you absolutely have to.\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with David Glueck: This class is conceptually way more difficult than organic chem. I think lots of people can get away with memorizing and regurgitating in CHEM 51 and 52 and once you get into a routine for that it isn't too bad. CHEM 64 is all about developing your chemical intuition and understanding the physical basis for different trends. There is also a large visualization component for this class. You need to be able to think about the complexes in 3D and spin them around to think about them from different angles, especially during the group theory section. Understanding catalytic mechanism can also be challenging. These exams were the most difficult I've taken at Dartmouth (apart from CHEM 91, which was also Glueck), but he curves them well despite very low raw scores. The lab is way better than orgo, both in terms of workload as well as it being interesting. Glueck is one of the most intelligent profs you will come across, and he is a really good teacher who cares about his students, even though his exams are near impossible. Would definitely recommend if you like chemistry, even if you didn't do well in orgo, because the two are completely different learning styles. That said, you can also do amazing in orgo and get destroyed by CHEM 64.\"",
            "review 3: \"23W with David Glueck: To whomever said that the content is manageable, I am glad I had the opportunity to be in a class with such a chem genius. In my humble non-genius opinion, the content was indeed interesting and Glueck is a good lecturer, despite being a little monotone. Once you get used to his teaching style, you will learn a lot about inorganic chemistry and also enjoy his adorable dad jokes. As someone mentioned below, Glueck is probably one of the sweetest professors in the department; he clearly cares about his students and it is evident how much he enjoys the content. However, this was way worse than Chen 57/58 for me and I started to feel hopeless when studying for the exams. As a senior chemistry major, his exams were more challenging than the ones in chem75. It was so frustrating to understand all the material, get to the exam and see extremely hard questions that involved detailed knowledge from previous courses. In fact, the first midterm had a mechanism question that we never mentioned in class. I genuinely think that unlike some professors, Glueck does not write such exams with the intention of lowering the median or giving a hard time to his students. He acknowledged that the low medians were expected with \u201cso many tough questions\u201d. He also constantly says that, \u201c\u2026 because chem64 students are so good\u2026\u201d I feel bad about writing this review because Glueck clearly cares and is one of the few kind professors in the department, but the problem is that he has way too high expectations. If you are an innate chemistry genius (I am not talking about doing well in honors orgo), you will highly enjoy this class. But many times I had no clue of what he was trying to ask on the exam (same for lab reports). Labs are super chill comparing to orgo. The TA is very nice, you never stay the whole time, and we have one lab report due per week. Many times the lab reports contained information/questions that haven\u2019t been taught yet. This class was very frustrating even though I feel like I learned a lot about inorganic chemistry. I would not recommend taking this class unless you have to or you are VERY VERY VERY good in chemistry. If you do decide to take the class, I would recommend: focus on the lectures and lecture notes, not the book. Make sure you know how to interpret NMR very well (including P, 13C NMR), and good luck! PS- he does curve it do an A-, but the stress before, during, and after each exam does not balance this.\"",
            "review 4: \"23W with David Glueck: I found this class to be better than orgo, close to chem 6 but with a really good professor who is super passionate about the topic. Glueck is awesome. He is kind and understanding, always willing to explain things and never condescending. He makes silly dad jokes in class and is a clear lecturer. The material in this class can be hard - its cut into 9 little units with 3 of them on each exam (two midterms and a noncumulative final). If you do the psets, pay attention in class, ask questions/go to office hours and really put in the time, the content is manageable and really interesting. You'd have to be a chem superstar to get an A in this class, but with an A- median and a lot of super smart people/chem majors in the class I imagine the majority of us will get the median.\"",

As this was during COVID, lectures were async and we used class time to do practice questions - this was pretty effective. Lab was somewhat boring (mostly watching videos) but material sill interesting. Exams weren't too difficult - first exam took a while but the others got easier (all were open note, 3.5 hours).\"",

The beginning takes a while because it's so stereochemmy but afterwards it's not horrible. The only thing is that you definitely need to stay on top of the problems and DO THE PRACTICE TESTS. His past exams are EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the ones he will give you and if you do the p-sets and the practice tests you should be familiar enough with the material to do at least decent. Super cool material though! Only drawback was that it's a 9 in the winter and powerpoint...if you're okay with that though, enjoy!\"",

I wasn't interested in \"inorganic\" chem prior to this class but totallly learned to love the material following the class. Prof. Glueck is completely available outside of class and is extremely open to both suggestions as well as helping you in whatever way possible. FANTASTIC class! Another great move by the chem department.\"",
            "review 21: \"05W with David Glueck: Professor Glueck is a nice guy and a good prof who was always willing to meet with students. Inorganic Chem is not a subject for everybody, but I thought it was cool and Glueck did his best to help explaing some of the contradictory and/or confusing material. The labs are fairly easy and pretty fun because you get to make beautiful crystals. The lab reports weren't too tedious, either, so all in all, one of the best chem labs you will get. Professor Glueck does give some hard exams, though. His first exam was ok, but then we had to redo part of it because of a modelling kit mishap where some students started using modelling kits during the exam, and that ended up bring up everyone's scores. So, for the next exam, Glueck made it pretty tough. it was still fine if you knew the material well, but it required some real effort. The final was the same. Much harder than what the practice exams would indicate. Other than being aware that chem exams can always be made exponentially harder, this class was enjoyable.\"",
            "review 22: \"05W with David Glueck: Pretty good class. It moves quickly, but the material is interesting; the first few weeks are basically a slightly more in-depth review of Chem 6, so if you've taken it relatively recently you won't have to study for the first few weeks(but don't worry if you took Chem 6 three years ago; it's not hard to pick up again). Prof. Glueck is a great lecturer, and he wrote his own book for the class so you don't have to take many notes in class. He's very willing to answer questions in class, but is slightly less friendly in office hours, so I would advise staying on top of the material and asking questions as it comes up in class, instead of waiting for the office hours right before an exam.\"",

Also, I do not understand why the course is required for all of the chemistry degrees. In addition, this course seems strange to be a prereq for any p chem classes.

Obviously, you are not going to take this course unless you have to. Good luck.\"",

Prof. Glueck made a valiant effort to keep the material interesting and to show its significance, but after a while, it's diffiult to keep the counting of electrons interesting. I do wish the professor could have been more quantitative. This is not a physical chemistry course, even though the textbook is written in a very quantitative way. Prof. Glueck tries to avoid the ugly math, which might be useful for future biochemists, pre-meds, and synthetic chemists. The term \"hand waving\" will be very familiar by the end of the course. The tests, like the labs, seemed arbitrary, and did not seem to measure understanding of the material. This is too bad - the material in the course is fairly straightforward, and most people mastered it well. The tests serve to create a bell curve where none would be needed otherwise.\"",

The material also made A LOT of sense, and if you just studied his (very good) lecture slides, you'd be able to understand the material.

He really really goes out of his way to mix up lectures with historical and cultural asides about famous scientists or particular discoveries. He was possible the best lecturer I've had at Dartmouth. He was somewhat poor in office hours, however. When I was confused on something he did not elucidate it for me. His tests were fair and similar to the practice exams. Hard yes, but what do you expect from an upper level chem class?\"",

Make no mistake, it certainly wasn't easy, but I felt a lot better about it than organic, it was much more logical and there were things you had to memorize but there was a huge emphasis on problem-solving and critical thinking that I didn't find in orgo. Not a lot of reaction mechanisms and most of the first 2/3 of the course is basic understanding of a lot of orbital and spectroscopy theory but if you do the work you will really get it and find it interesting because it makes sense and really clicks. The exams were tough, but fair I thought. Hughes is a very entertaining lecturer and though his slides/notes are not particularly wonderful they are adequate if you pay attention and really focus during lecture. He really made an effort to keep students interested, he included quotes and stories in his lectures and one of them the class actually applauded after the x-hour was over the lecture was so entertaining. But he really understands it and can answer any question you have, and is very available. I would have loved to have Hughes use the board more, because I learn better from the board than from the slides but overall the lectures were a good representation of how to get through the material.\"",

If you are thinking about taking this class, give the first lecture or two a shot and see if you like (you probably will). I was immediately hooked by his lecturing on day one. The only caveat is that most of the other people in the class are also majors or minors so getting a good grade is competitive. There is much less memorization and much more analysis in this course than there was in organic chemistry.

            "review 1: \"23X with Dean Wilcox, Gordon Gribble, Franklin Dorman, Anita Prasad: Wilcox The Wilcox section focuses on environmental chem through inorganic and atmospheric chemistry lenses. This section is by far the most conceptually difficult, and the exam had a pretty low median. You need to understand radical reaction pathways, biogeochemical cycles, and climate trends resulting from chemicals in the atmosphere. This section is difficult to study for and relies more heavily on intuition. Dorman Definitely the most fun out of all the sections. Dorman teaches for fun and will teach you whatever you want him to tell you more about. You learn a lot about analytical chemistry and discuss how to detect many toxic substances and really low concentrations. He also talks about forensic chemistry which is super cool. Gribble The Gribble section focuses on environmental organic chemistry and looks at the synthesis and breakdown of different pesticides and fertilizers. He also takes a lot of weird detours and starts talking about making nerve agents and different events in the history of German organic chemistry. Its kinda rogue. The exam is completely about regurgitating specific information from his massive slide decks. If you are a pre-med and used to dealing with that kinda stuff, you will do fine. If you don't know how to memorize massive amounts of info, you will struggle. Prasad You do a term long lab project in a small group. Prasad will help you with anything you need (including buying expensive chemicals)and its a good opportunity to design your own projects and experiments. Easiest lab experience you will have in a chem class.\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with Dean Wilcox, Gordon Gribble, Franklin Dorman, Anita Prasad: Honestly a very unique class. The class is taught by 3 lecture professors and 1 lab prof, who each determine 25% of your grade. The class is divided into sections for each of the professors about the environment and its chemistry. Usually, the teaching order changed for us from what I was told about last year, which made it VERY BACK LOADED. Wilcox- Started the course with lessons on the atmosphere and finished with the troposphere, stratosphere, and climate change. He tested us with a PSET during the first part and a \"short\" quiz during the second part (2 hours). The entirety of Wilcox's section was very GEN-CHEM heavy and it was honestly pretty painful. If anyone had him for gen chem in the spring of 21, you know how awful he is. During his second part of teaching, he literally gave us problem sets to practice with that had nothing to do with what he taught. AKA, we were expected to learn the concept using the PSET for the exam. He is also super inconsistent with grading when it came to the PSET. I compared with friends after and we lost points for different parts even though we said similar things. Finally, this last thing speaks to his character. One of the students lost their copy of the notes before the final exam for the last lesson. Wilcox has a copy of notes he sometimes uploads if a student was sick (lectures not recorded), but doesn't always upload them. When the student asked for a copy of the notes to salvage whatever they had lost, Wilcox literally said no... What kind of person does that bruh. Dorman- Focuses a lot on analytical chemistry and investigative chemistry and taught right after Wilcox's 1st part and right before Wilcox's second part. He uses an exam essay to test us which everyone gets a 90+ on. He is a very chill person and NONE of the material he teaches is tested. AKA HE TEACHES FOR FUN. Honestly probably the best section in terms of vibes. He would start every class with a real world chemistry story which was nice. We get the entire term for the essay exam and he is always happy to meet and discuss your ideas. Gribble- Does the organic chemistry section. He tests us using an exam worth 25% of grade. Gribble only teaches one longer section and he is right in the middle of the course after Dorman's 1st section and before Dorman's second section. His section really isn't super organic chemistry based. Its just a lot of slides that you have to memorize stuff off of. Like for example, if we learned about sarin gas, you would need to know any events associated with it that he discussed. There's a lot, but he is always happy to meet with you to clarify what needs to be known. Gribble's an amazing dude and his personality shone through during his grading of the exam.

There wasn't any reading or homework, outside of the lab which took a long time. Gribble printed off his slides in bound syllabi for us, which was nice, and Milde did a similar thing. Both professors held office hours, and though Milde is sometimes hard to track down, once you can talk to her, both professors were good in office hours. The way the course was graded was the most disappointing part of it--Gribble's midterm on the first half of the material only counted for a quarter of the grade, as did the extensive lab project, while Milde's final on the second half of the material counted for half of the grade.

Schneider's part of the course, on the other hand, was not real inspiring. He usually alternated lectures with problem solving sessions, and the majority of the problems were similar to those that you would encounter in Chem 5/6. The material was interesting, but Schneider emphasized problem solving on the exam, so much of the interesting part of the material was lost while frantically trying to remember simple things from Chem 5/6 for the problems. This class would have been much more worthwhile if the emphasis had been on the environmental issues and reactions in the environment than on simple problem solving.

This section is difficult to study for and relies more heavily on intuition. Dorman Definitely the most fun out of all the sections.

You learn a lot about analytical chemistry and discuss how to detect many toxic substances and really low concentrations. He also talks about forensic chemistry which is super cool.

He also takes a lot of weird detours and starts talking about making nerve agents and different events in the history of German organic chemistry. Its kinda rogue.

The class is taught by 3 lecture professors and 1 lab prof, who each determine 25% of your grade. The class is divided into sections for each of the professors about the environment and its chemistry. Usually, the teaching order changed for us from what I was told about last year, which made it VERY BACK LOADED. Wilcox- Started the course with lessons on the atmosphere and finished with the troposphere, stratosphere, and climate change. He tested us with a PSET during the first part and a \"short\" quiz during the second part (2 hours). The entirety of Wilcox's section was very GEN-CHEM heavy and it was honestly pretty painful. If anyone had him for gen chem in the spring of 21, you know how awful he is. During his second part of teaching, he literally gave us problem sets to practice with that had nothing to do with what he taught. AKA, we were expected to learn the concept using the PSET for the exam. He is also super inconsistent with grading when it came to the PSET. I compared with friends after and we lost points for different parts even though we said similar things. Finally, this last thing speaks to his character. One of the students lost their copy of the notes before the final exam for the last lesson. Wilcox has a copy of notes he sometimes uploads if a student was sick (lectures not recorded), but doesn't always upload them. When the student asked for a copy of the notes to salvage whatever they had lost, Wilcox literally said no... What kind of person does that bruh. Dorman- Focuses a lot on analytical chemistry and investigative chemistry and taught right after Wilcox's 1st part and right before Wilcox's second part. He uses an exam essay to test us which everyone gets a 90+ on. He is a very chill person and NONE of the material he teaches is tested. AKA HE TEACHES FOR FUN. Honestly probably the best section in terms of vibes. He would start every class with a real world chemistry story which was nice. We get the entire term for the essay exam and he is always happy to meet and discuss your ideas. Gribble- Does the organic chemistry section. He tests us using an exam worth 25% of grade. Gribble only teaches one longer section and he is right in the middle of the course after Dorman's 1st section and before Dorman's second section. His section really isn't super organic chemistry based. Its just a lot of slides that you have to memorize stuff off of. Like for example, if we learned about sarin gas, you would need to know any events associated with it that he discussed. There's a lot, but he is always happy to meet with you to clarify what needs to be known. Gribble's an amazing dude and his personality shone through during his grading of the exam. He was beyond fair, offered 6 extra points of extra credit, and was very lax on grading. One question I literally completely messed up on, but he gave me full points because I was technically right.

Grubbs is a great professor, but I don't think the professors for 52 are bad. Also, the small class size turns out not to be very helpful, because the material isn't really difficult to understand; there is just a lot of it to memorize.

However, exams are very difficult to prepare for. It's entirely possible to do all the problems in the chapters leading up to an exam and be completely stumped on one or two questions. This means you really, really need to know and understand the mechanisms and the reasons why certain reactions run in and out so you can perform on test day, which is crucial. You have three exams, no assigned homework, and an ambiguous lab grade. This means that each of those three test days is extremely important, and you need to make sure that you are prepared at that time. Prepare early, and don't get sidetracked!

I was really impressed with Professor Gribble, as I have been with all of my other professors in the chemistry department. He gave very straightforward lectures and equally straightforward exams. There were always a few very tricky problems, which sometimes seemed unanswerable, but the odds were that very few people would get them. He was also very flexible in grading the retrosynthesis questions, so you could easily get full credit for very long syntheses that were not entirely practical.

Professor Venkatesan also compiled the information for the last unit into slides/pdfs with annotations that really helped improve my understanding of the material, so I really appreciated that. This class was a lot of work though, even virtual. Besides lecture (including x-hour, not surprising there), we also had literature discussions at an additional time where we finished going through a journal paper's synthesis if we didn't finish it in the x-hour. Though the literature reviews were interesting, sometimes I found the mechanisms to be over my head if they were ones we hadn't gone over yet or weren't part of the o-chem curriculum. We also had reading quizzes at the start of each lecture, so we were expected to have completed the reading ahead of time, and we were expected to do the textbook questions and the professor's problem sets at our own time. Virtual lab was not the best learning experience, but it probably took less time than on campus.\"",
            "review 2: \"20S with Pushpa Venkatesan: Professor Venkatesan cares so much about her students and put a lot of effort into making honors organic chemistry an engaging online course. However, with that being said, there are some aspects of the class to consider, which of course, might be different if you get to take this class in person. We met MWF on Zoom for lectures and used x hour every tuesday. The first 7 or 8 x hours were used for literature reviews. Basically, we would receive an organic chemistry paper before x hour which we would each try to read. There was a sign-up sheet on piazza (a discussion forum used in place of canvas) where the class would write down any reactions we identified and during the x hour, we could take turns suggesting mechanisms. However, while it was recommended, it was not mandatory to sign up to present mechanisms. The mechanisms covered during literature reviews were much more complicated than those covered in class; however, they were similar in difficulty to those asked on the exams. Each lecture (MWF) began with a short reading quiz (just one question) based on the reading for the night before. The reading quizzes were not graded, but we submitted all of them after lecture and Professor Venkatesan would add individual feedback that was helpful. Of course, since future online courses and in-person courses will be back to normal grading, these might count for a grade in the future. The readings before each class were generally half a chapter each so they were not too overwhelming. However, the textbook is pretty dense (Organic Chemistry Structure and Function by Vollhardt- 6th edition) but if you took chem 57 you should already be used to it. We also had problem sets, but we did not submit these and they were not graded (of course this might be different once universal pass/fail is over). The most difficult portion of chem 58 was definitely the exams, which were much harder than the problem sets. We had 3 midterms and a final; the midterms were supposed to be 2 hours each and the final was supposed to be 3 hours. However, I took 3-4 hours on each midterm and nearly 5 hours on the final, as did many of my classmates. The exams were heavily focused on synthesis and mechanisms, and these mechanisms were often pulled directly from organic chem literature. For instance, each midterm was about 8 questions, but the final question was very long and counted for roughly half of the exam. This question would have a multistep synthesis from a journal and the sub-questions would ask you to propose a mechanism for each step. This was especially challenging since these are not mechanisms you have seen before or could have memorized from class, but rather, you need to use your \"chemical intuition\" to propose a reasonable mechanism on the spot. The literature discussions for x hours were helpful for preparing for this, as was doing many practice problems from the textbook to gain proficiency. The first midterm caught everyone by surprise since there were no past exams for us to study, so we were not prepared for the format. Future classes will likely get access to past exams to practice with so you should be better prepared. Finally, the lab portion\u2013 we used a combination of Beyond Labz software and watching videos of actual experiments being performed to complete labs. For all labs, we wrote out everything in our notebooks as if we were really carrying out the experiments and we wrote a lab report. Lab was not too time-consuming and would definitely take longer on campus since you can't put your reaction on 2x speed! Overall, this course was challenging but we learned so much from covering so much material. If you have to take it online, you will be missing out on gaining skills in the lab, but you will still get to learn the lecture material in great detail.\"",
            "review 3: \"20S with Pushpa Venkatesan: Almost everything I was going to write was covered by the previous two reviews. So here's my personal take: I took CHEM 57 in 20W and liked it, but I guess I\u2019m not as passionate about chemistry as I thought I was. Thanks, Dr. Venkatesan, for helping me discover this in the most taxing way possible.\"",
            "review 4: \"20S with Pushpa Venkatesan: As a continuation of 57, this class is still brutal. Tons of material thrown in there and I'm glad that it was pass/fail this term. Overall, I think Venkatesan did a pretty good job of explaining the material - I finally got a grasp of a lot of Orgo concepts that weren't clear from 57. The \"reading quizzes\" (graded for completion) at the start of class as well as the mechanism practice were also great helps and really helped me to understand and read chemical literature. My one big grievance, as many have voiced above, is her exam design. While she claimed that the exams would take around 2 hours, all of them took at least 3, with the final pushing well beyond 4. Many of the questions were also radically different from class material, adding to the confusion. Venkatesan is a nice prof and she really cares, but I'm not so sure I'd be willing to take this class again for a grade. Lab was also boring as hell this term - can't replicate labs with some dumb software.\""

However, I think that this class goes more into detail about the underlying concepts behind the hundreds of reactions we have to memorize as well as the other techniques, for example, spectroscopy, that we study in the class. To some people having to learn even more than just the reactions and laboratory techniques may make it more difficult to learn the rest of the material, but I think that learning WHY everything works the way it does helped me to learn those hundreds of reactions better. I also think the underlying principles of organic chemistry are hundreds of times more interesting than memorizing reactions and such, so that part of the class was a plus. Also it's the principles that you actually retain 5 years down the road, not the reactions. However, the class is extremely fast-paced. The class moves so quickly that sometimes after a test I would go to class the next day already 2 or 3 chapters behind. I have never spent this much time working for a class, but it was rewarding to understand it all so well at the end. The small class size is the main reason that I took the honors version of the class, but if you are slow at understanding things in class it is hard to keep up with the fast-paced lectures and crazy questions asked by the many ridiculously smart people who take this class. Also if you read the assigned chapters before class it IMMENSELY helps understand the lectures, but no matter what I did I could not manage to stay on top of the reading.

The material is a little dry at times, and his presentation is very straightforward, which was fine since I didn't really expect him to bring the material to life. The tests do require a fair amount of thinking (in terms of manipulating a lot of the information that you've memorized), but adequate preparation and sound reasoning ability makes them quite manageable. The tests, it should also be noted, are extremely fair and accurately reflected my level of preparation, which seems to be a common theme in the chemistry department.

He gives clear, interesting, and engaging lectures, which make clear the central concepts of the course. He makes the material fascinating to listen to, and presents it in an accessible fashion. He is incredibly responsive to questions, and he stimulates the class' interest in the subject by asking question. He is very accessible during office hours, is always willing to help a student that doesn't understand, and is a great teacher one on one. He doesn't just give you the answer, but rather, walks you through it step by step, and will sit there patiently until you finally figure it out. He is always open to discussion, about chemistry or anything else you may want to discuss. He gives fair exams, which he grades fairly and consistently, and in a timely fashion. He also will seek out his students if he knows they need help, or to discuss an exam, and he will personally invite you to come and see him. He is good at keeping in frequent contact with the class via blitz, and about having frequent, and extra if need be, office hours. This is a truly great course, and if you need to take organic chemistry for any reason, you should definitely consider taking this smaller, \"honors\" section. Admittance is self-selected, thus you don't have to have had a minimum grade in General chemistry or anything, but it is definitely worth you time.

On the other hand, it's surprisingly comprehensible, especially with this prof (he's awesome); the hard part is REMEMBERING all the different reactions and when they can and can't be applied. The grade is made up entirely of the exams; there aren't any problem sets, graded or otherwise. This, however, is a very, VERY bad thing, because you have little idea of where to focus your studying, so you try to remember a little bit of everything but end up remembering a lot of nothing. The practice exams didn't help much, because even if they're last year's class's actual exams, the exams WE had were much, much harder. And of course, they're strictly timed, which makes it a lot harder to think things through and definitely contributed to the rash of reading mistakes (don't make them, since the prof takes half off automatically for this) on the first exam. As for this class versus 51, the smaller class size, higher median, and lack of anal-ness with regards to less important details (see the title) is a very good thing. I would say, go for it, by all means, and remember that you can NRO this course. ^_~ So, don't fall behind on the readings, and try to do every problem in the textbook. Sound unreasonable? Live with it. If you're taking this class, make sure you pick two other classes that don't make too many demands on your time. Good luck, and enjoy the milk/coffee and cookies that the prof brings in from time to time towards the end of the course!\"",
            "review 8: \"06F with Peter Jacobi: This course is very time-consuming (6 hour labs) and challenging (honors, so everyone is motivated), but you learn a ton more than you would in regular orgo if you're willing to risk your GPA. By virtue of having more motivated students, everyone is pushed to learn the material to a better degree. In addition, the tests make you feel like you haven't learned all that much, since they pretty much wreck you. My one piece of advice would be to keep up with the lectures in terms of reading and problems. Jacobi will tell you this and you'll probably ignore it, but if you want a good grade you'll do it, since half the class will actually listen to him (I was in the other half).\"",

Professor Jacobi lectures without notes and the course progresses very logically and fluidly. Also, the course is very well structured, although slightly fast-paced. Professor Jacobi has a good sense of humor, which adds to the liveliness of the class. The class is more competitive and thus it is curved higher. However it is probably still harder to get a better grade than you might achieve in 51, especially if you excel at Chemistry. Despite this, I would still recommend this class as it is a fantastic experience. Also, the textbook used in 57 (Vollhardt) explains concepts in a more logical manner than the book used in 51. If you are that lonely freshman (or group of sophomores) contemplating taking this class, I would highly recommend it. There are no curveballs in this class, so if you come in with a passion for the organic side of chemistry, and are prepared to dedicate some time to it, you will most certainly have an enjoyable experience.\"",

The subject matter can be mildly interesting if you're into it but it's a crapload to learn if you're not psyched about it. It's fun to problem solve your way out of reactions, but again it's a lot to learn and you're not really sure why you're spending your time memorizing pointless things instead of gallivanting out on the thousands of other opportunities college throws at you every 5 seconds. I would advise staying on top of the material as the cram method, while you'll do it anyways, induces lots of ulcers but does make it fun to see exactly how far you can come when you know nothing in the morning and your exam is that night.

He's really chill and gives excellent lectures and notes. I didn't crack the book the entire course (NOT recommended...) but did fine(ish) based on his lectures alone.

He is also interested in laboratory techniques, such as why acid would have to be used instead of base, etc. As such, some of the test material is not explicitly stated in the book. Do the problems multiple times (especially the ones on the practice tests). Know everything you can about NMR's, and pay attention to all the mechanisms. They really will help you if you forget what certain reagents do, or at least help you make an educated guess. Some notes to the professor: keys for practice exams make them infinitely more useful. As terrifying as the random calling on people was (for a person like me, who hates to speak in class) I think it actually made me pay attention and learn more. The most useful homeworks we did were the ones we went over in class. The ones I did on my own caused me pain because they just gave me one more day that I had something to have ready for chemistry, and I didn't feel like I learned much from them. I liked how you went over all the mechanisms in class, but I feel that more detailed powerpoints on the rest of the material would have better helped me remember all the information (especially about which reactions were reversible, when to use base vs acid induced hydrolysis, etc.)\"",

Professor Veale is great, much better than other chemistry professors that I have had, and this is the general sentiment among my classmates. I have also heard that taking this course with Veale is easier than with other professors because he doesn't leave you clueless as what you will be tested on. He'll tell you for a certain equation, \"This is my favorite equation.\" Or, \"This equation landed me my first job.\" Or, \"I'll put this on the test.\" If you show up to class, you'll do fine in it. And it's not like he's giving away answers, because he says stuff like that for virtually ever important equation and mechanism. Take advantage of the sample tests he provides. Out of the three he gives you, you can compile about 80% of the new exam, word for word--especially the first one, where there isn't a lot of material. Is this unfair? I say no. He gets me to write like 12 exams on top of studying for the course, I think it's brilliant. He really emphasizes HNMR. It's a good thing to know.

Matt Damon then writes the answer for her on a napkin. After taking this course, so could I, and that makes me feel like a player. You will learn how to cram for this course, it's impossible not to. There's also a certain amount of luck involved when it comes to studying the right things. This class makes you competitive because it's completely curved. I have the mentality \"I don't care if I get a sixty on this exam, so long as the median is a fifty.\" Overall, this class was excellent. Also, it is easier than chem 51. TAKE IT!! Note to the Prof: What's the deal with the bonus questions? If the class is curved, there's no such thing as a bonus question.

The pace of the lectures is rather quick, too; the class tends to cover a chapter every two and a half lectures.

I highly recommend that the homework portion stays with this course - unfortunately it is only worth 5% of the grade - it should be worth more. Having an exam every other Monday made summer excursions and visits from family and friends difficult but it is the only to have a semester of orgo in one term.

Everything is mechanisms and syntheses. As a biology major I see that the class is in fact relevant to my studies because so much of it is devoted to carbonyl compounds. True, living organisms don't use sulfuric acid or potassium permanganate to carry out chemical reactions, but the mechanisms are probably similar. And towards the end of the class we learned about sugars and peptides, and I learned many properties of these compounds that I had not known before. I liked Prof. Veale. He made a constant (and successful) effort to get the class involved, and did his best to use anecdotes to make dry material interesting.

He honestly seemed to belittle/bully students who asked too many questions. 2) No practice material, outside of the textbook. He would cover stuff that was not in the textbook, and when asked for practice material on it, would say he didn't want to waste his time making any. No quizzes, no problem sets, no problem solving sessions like in Orgo I, and no keys for practice exams.

I was not given answers to the practice exam and was forced to \"collaborate\" with other students to figure the questions out. This class was the biggest waste of time and motivated me to drop premed as well as my intent to major in chemistry. I genuinely enjoyed CHEM 5, 6, and 51, so this was a major bummer.

The class consisted of one midterm and one final, and these exams were the only things that affected your grade. The material was definitely difficult, and Micalizio did a poor job of clearly explaining it during lecture. He would often skip many steps in a mechanism or would scribble them on the board for approximately half a second before moving on to the next reaction. He made it very clear he was very knowledgeable on the subject but did not do a good job at effectively conveying this knowledge to the class. Before the final we were given a practice final (no answer key), but it was nothing like the actual final. Micalizio also did not make himself available at all for questioning the week leading up to the final. Other classmates I conferred with after the exam also agreed that we were not given adequate resources to be set up for any sort of success on the final.\"",

I remember our last class session, we reviewed for the final exam and when someone asked about a steroid synthesis that we had walked through a week or two ago, he went through the entire synthesis, BY MEMORY. So class was fast-paced (what else do you expect from orgo) but actually quite enjoyable. In terms of material, we didn't get to the amino acids/carbohydrates part of orgo that most orgo 2 classes get to by the end of the quarter, but I think that was partly because Micalizio liked to go a little beyond the textbook and talk about what he called \"advanced topics\" for some of the chapters. In terms of grading, this was my one huge complaint with the class. 50% of our grade was determined by our midterm, which consisted of 13 multiple choice questions and 2 multistep, fill in reagents syntheses - no partial credit. And yes, this meant that one multiple choice answer could be worth 5-10 points on its own. The other 50% was determined by our final exam, which had maybe 8 or so MC questions, 2 syntheses, and maybe 20 or so \"given this starting molecule and these reagents, give the chemical structure of the final compound, stereochem included\". So that was extraordinarily stressful and I very much did not like that part of the class. However, I will say that Micalizio didn't really put in a ton of trick questions - if you studied well and understood everything from class and the textbook, the exams were pretty straightforward. All in all, not the worst orgo class possible - it was mainly just the exams.\"",

He prioritized lecture material over the textbook material so I spent most of my time understanding the reactions we went over in lecture.

This would often be followed by a correction email that entirely contradicted what was said in-class. Not only was this a confusing way to learn organic chemistry, it was paired with consistent threats of setting the median at a B- due to the poor performance of the section in relation to Cathy's previous sections of chem52 (disregarding the fact that the exam medians were higher than any other chem class I have ever taken as a chem major and the fact that 21X was taught online due to covid).

Moreover, his quiet lecturing style and lack of organization made following his notes very difficult. At times, he expected us to have a working knowledge of certain concepts that were omitted from our teaching of chem 51. All that being said, I'm glad that I took the course with him. He provided us with a foundational knowledge of organic chemistry that I think everyone was lacking. In chem 51, we often learned concepts with Dr. Ke and ignored the reasoning behind them. However, it was Professor Wu who spent time going back and explaining it so that we could approach chem 52 better. Moreover, Professor Wu was an incredibly supportive individual. He held office hours 4x a week for students to find appropriate help and always responded to emails within a day for any questions or concerns, even on weekends. Simply put, he's an amazing professor if you actually want to learn anything about organic chemistry. I think there are definitely improvements that Wu can make in his teaching style. If you are to take the course, here are some things to keep in mind: 1) The tests only covered mechanisms/ synthesis problems (never IR, NMR, etc.) and only were 4 questions long. For many individuals, the format let them leave the exam room much earlier. For others, though, it made it so that any misconceptions on a question would result in massive point deductions. Regardless, the format was not perfect and basically made it so that doing the homework would have no impact on your success in the class. 2) At the start of the course, we moved incredibly slow and after a few weeks of getting behind, we started to move incredibly fast.

WEEKLY MIDTERMS. 25% of my class dropped (perhaps considered the lucky ones) and the median skyrocketed (who knows how the curve will be or what grade I will end up with). He single handedly ruined my 19W academic and social life, people rarely saw me. Office hours were not helpful, he acted extremely condescending and did not efficiently answer questions. I put in so much more effort than I did in Chem51 and will not even get a grade I will be pleased with. I hope he never teaches again and if he does, I am sorry you will have to take it with him.\"",
            "review 4: \"19W with Mark Spaller: This was THE WORST academic experience of my life. Spaller's course was organized in an absolutely inhumane way, and his teaching methods were unlike those of any of the other three chemistry professors I've had at Dartmouth. His weekly quizzes, although sounding like a good idea at first, quickly proved to be an absolute DISASTER! Having a quiz every Friday takes up one of the four regular class days and means that there are only three lectures in the week to prepare you for the upcoming assessment. This means that we usually had to cram 1.5 to 2 chapters of dense material into just three hours of instruction per week. On top of that, he assigned 40-50 textbook problems for each chapter as practice (having to do between 50 and 80 practice problems per week was the norm). Spaller refused to offer practice quizzes and exams, and insisted that the textbook problems were sufficient practice. They weren't, however, because they usually took an inordinate amount of time to complete and made it nearly impossible to master the material in such a short time. I felt that I could only understand most of the textbook questions after having gotten them wrong and reviewing the answer, at which point a practice quiz would have been useful as a source of novel material for self-assessment as well as to entrain myself to quiz-taking conditions (especially timing). The other thing is, Spaller is the only one of the four chemistry professors I've had who chose to teach through PowerPoint presentations, rather than writing things out on the board. This allowed him to speed through his lectures at disorienting speeds while leaving minimal time for explanation. OK RANT OVER. TLDR: If you want to spare your mental health big time, take Orgo 2 with someone else.\""

            "review 1: \"21W with Pushpa Venkatesan: In Chem52, professor Venkatesan tried to adapt her teaching method more to the online format than Chem51. She started recording lectures and problem sessions and trying to be a bit more organized in her lectures. For most of the term the lectures were more organized than they were in Chem 51, however they were often still rushed (due to the short nature of the term) and she would frequently go on tangents. Pushpa was always on PIAZZA and she held office hours all the time. Professor Venkatesan loves organic chemistry and genuinely wants her students to learn. That being said, intentions don't necessarily reflect the reality of what happened. I found it incredibly challenging to learn in class lectures, and I learned best form the text book and khan academy videos. I spent a lot of time thinking about what to say about this course in order to be fair to the professor, because I think she really means well, but she is just lacking emotional intelligence. Organic chemistry is notoriously hard, but the professor did not create a good learning environment, and was borderline emotionally abusive. The professor is very good at organic chemistry and is not very understanding if you are not. She scared people, embarrassed them, and made them uncomfortable to ask questions in class. She disregarded and belittled our requests teaching methods that would help us learn. She told us she wished we were better at chemistry and she wished we would just work harder to understand the material. The learning environment she created was one of hostility and embarrassment. It was incredibly hard to learn when we were consistently told that the material wasn\u2019t hard, but rather that there was a problem with us and our ability to think, reason, study, and work hard. Its challenging mentally to spend ~30hrs per week doing organic chemistry, just to be told that you\u2019re not working hard enough and you\u2019re not smart enough. She made judgements about who she thought was working hard based on who showed up to office hours, neglecting that students have other classes, people were putting in hours upon hours at home on their own time study, and that not everyone was lucky enough to be untouched by the pandemic and have all of their waking hours and mental energy to spend on organic chemistry. I just wish that she had been a little more understanding and flexible. If she had listened to us, maybe her intentions of teaching us would have better reflected reality. I hope that in the future she can learn from the online experience to be more flexible in her teaching style and to listen to students rather than just hearing us and letting that information trickle out the other ear. For all you future students, I hope that she listens to you when you ask for teaching adjustments that would help you learning style. And I hope she doesn\u2019t make you feel incompetent, stupid, lazy, or like you don\u2019t belong at this school. To all of you who have her in the future, you belong here, you will get through this, and you are not alone!\"",

I promise that if you take this class with any other professor, you will learn more and you will get a better grade. Please trust me on this - NEVER TAKE CHEM WITH PUSHPA.\""

However, the material is really interesting stuff; it feels like \"real\" chemistry, as opposed to general chem, which was a joke... and you begin to really appreciate the differences structure can make. The organic synthesis problems you get are pretty hard, but it's amazing to think \"Hey, with the right reagents, I can make these molecules by doing these steps...\" The course itself is of course hard, and I thankfully I took two easier courses with it; I wrote I spent 22 hours out of class per week and I probably spent more on some weekends. However, if you outline the chapters and do the problems, you will do fine. The practice exams Professor Hughes provided were wonderful - the actual exam had almost the exact same format. If you think the practice exams are hard, but go over them and really understand what you did wrong, when you take the real test, you'll feel pretty confident. And of course, the professor... Prof. Hughes is simply amazing! I wish he taught every course at Dartmouth! He not only had incredibly clear and efficient lectures (for instance, teaching one chapter in more detail than the book in an hour and a half), he was hilarious! We also learned British slang and he had funny interludes in his lecture slides. One bit of advice: read and outline the chapters *before* lecture, because he goes so quickly that if you're trying to understand the material for the first time, you'll just be lost the whole lecture. That being said, the lectures really help you understand the material. I went to office hours only three or so times (plus the four \"big\" office hours he had before exams), but each time he was helpful and understanding about any problems students had.

            "review 82: \"02F with Russell Hughes: I will address what many other student reviews overtly fail to, so that this review might actually be of use. This review is for everyone except those followers in the front row who so annoyingly giggled at everything the prof said and sneered at the students who asked good questions. First, the pros: 1) The material is enjoyable and interesting, for the most part. 2) You become proud of yourself for working so hard. 3) The basics of organic chemistry are such that you can teach yourself the skeleton, and have holes filled in for you during lecture. 4) Prof. Hughes is entertaining, he has enough enthusiasm to get others excited, and his demonstrations are great. The only major (and yes it is major) criticism about the prof: The professor, while entertaining and humorous at times, was (for the most part) quite anal about answering questions. It was as if he was jolly and approachable while he lectured, and as soon as a hand went up his demeanor would change completely. He had very little patience for answering questions, and this was an enormous disappointment to me. What distinguishes a decent professor (one who merely lectures well) from an outstanding professor is his/her ability to help students and connect with them. I asked questions many times during class, and many times I received unsatisfactory, jeering, and almost hostile answers. I have also heard from multiple students that he has little patience during office hours as well. Some found this class to be more enjoyable because they quelled their desire to ask questions and resigned their ability to think until outside of lecture - instead, they merely giggled like automated puppets whenever given the opportunity, fueling the prof's snide remarks in response to students' questions. (Perhaps these giggling students were the smart ones, given the professor's attitude towards curious students.) More than once did I and many other students feel a bit humiliated for asking questions. One last thing: the tests were HARD. I think most people will agree that not enough time is given. The allotted 2.5 hours is strictly adhered to, and usually this is not enough time to answer all the questions satisfactorily. It is my belief that students should run out of knowledge rather than time. Perhaps this was the method of generating grade separation, but it also generated much overall frustration. Overall, this class had the potential to be spectacular, but instead it was just above mediocre. WORK HARD, VERY HARD, and hopefully for you it will be just above mediocre as well.\"",

This class made me feel like i was taking some standardized test all over again. I am so bitter about my grade. But i bask in the pride of having learnt a lot of Orgo.

            "review 1: \"23S with Chenfeng Ke: I actually really liked Ke as a professor, he was a good lecturer and went at a fairly good pace, had good handwriting (actually very helpful for orgo since it's so visual!), and would tell some funny and random chemistry lab anecdotes sometimes to break up the lecture. He is also very realistic and told us on the first day of class that this would be a hard class and this is very true! But the best way to keep up is to do the textbook problems and make sure to work through the stuff you don't understand. Frankie the TSF was amazing; super friendly and very patient explaining hard concepts, and explaining them in a very easy to understand way. The orgo labs were a bit annoying but the TAs were very nice and very helpful during the lab! The lab notebook part is super particular and the prelab prep takes so long and is very tedious, and needs to be done in a very specific way. I feel that many people try and scare you by saying how bad orgo is, but although it's a difficult subject, I quite enjoyed the class overall.\"",
            "review 2: \"23S with Chenfeng Ke: So this was Ke's last term teaching chem 51, so the class was much different than it was in the past. For beginners, apparently he went \"easier\" on us. By easier I mean he cut out some mechanisms we needed to learn, we needed to know what the reagents did but not the actual electron pushing steps. Overall, I would say I throughly enjoyed chem 51, but because of the resources we had available. Our LSF was a '22 named Frankie and that man was Godsend. He explained concepts so well which was really needed because Ke is a researcher not a professor at heart and didn't realize we didn't know what was going on half of the time. My general advice for orgo is to do all the assigned textbook problems and if a step doesn't make sense; ask about it. If the content in class is confusing read the textbook, it's actually super helpful. Lastly, use online resources, orgo is a universal subject so a bunch a resources are available online. Also make flashcards of the mechanisms and review them a little bit everyday because once you have them mastered they just become second nature and you can worry about all the other topics. Overall orgo 1 isn't as scary as everyone makes it out to be, but it definitely takes a lot work and self-teaching to succeed.\"",
            "review 3: \"21S with Chenfeng Ke: Honestly after reading the layup list reviews for last year, I was beyond terrified of this course with this professor. I was really pleasantly surprised - he is actually a really nice guy who is always available by email or in 1-on-1 office hours to help out with chemistry. The learning fellows and teaching science fellow were all a godsend. That being said, the class is still organic chemistry, so it really sucks. It's an insane amount of material, but not unmanageable if you take it with two easy classes (DO NOT TAKE IT WITH ANOTHER DIFFICULT COURSE). Online, it consisted of 2 exams and 15 quizzes on each of the chapters we covered - the exams were both super high stakes which made them really stressful, but they were fair. Professor Ke's lectures weren't bad but some were really confusing - I mainly relied on the book and external resources for learning. Do not fall behind on problem sets!!\"",
            "review 4: \"21S with Chenfeng Ke: Professor Ke was great, I personally found his lectures great as well - I'm not the kind that can read a book and understand it well on the first go, so his video lectures were helpful. I wish I had met him virtually, he seemed to have changed a lot given what previous reviews have said about him; the class, nevertheless, was rigorous and a bit stressful (as compared to other pre-med reqs). I'm not sure if 20S had a teaching science fellow for o-chem 1, but I echo the 21S review below mine: the teaching science fellow (Victoria) was a godsend and an incredible teacher; when I couldn't attend her chapter review sessions, I made sure I did and re-did the practice sheets she would post on Canvas. Further, as Professor Ke stresses, doing as many problems from the textbook is key; I personally didn't do every problem after each chapter, but probably ended doing 60-80 percent depending on how I felt about the material. I also attended many 1-on-1 sessions with the teaching science fellow to clarify concepts. Learning fellows in the class were also very helpful. I think I averaged to around 6-8 hours doing practice problems each week, which I think worked well for me - our TSF also posted recommended problems from the textbook which we should focus on. Exams were definitely stressful, since they accounted for 70 percent of our grade. But the time given to complete them was definitely fair. Overall, this class was a wake-up call and something that prepares you for med-school-like study habits (although definitely easier). You need to consistently be putting in the work because it accumulates and builds off of the foundation you build the previous week. If you don't like memorizing but like puzzles, spatial geometry, math, problem-solving, logic problems, or coding to name a few, you will definitely enjoy this class - there is some memorization, but a lot of applied things to exercise your mind. There isn't a plug-and-chug formula like there is for gen chem, nor is there a straightforward memorized answer for every question like there is for foundation bios 12 and 14. This is one of those classes where I think the more time you spend on it, the more fun/enjoyable the material gets.\"",
            "review 5: \"21S with Chenfeng Ke: I thought Professor Ke's class was pretty great! He always had tons of opportunities to meet with him and was available to answer emails during exam times. I liked his lectures and note style so understanding concepts was usually ok. We only had 2 exams which were 30% and 40% of our grade which was stressful, but the questions were fair. Before each exam, he told us what types of problems we should expect to see and how he expects us to answer them. In terms of studying, make sure to do the problems as you learn the chapter! It's fine not to do every textbook problem since there is a lot, but definitely do any problems that your teaching fellow recommends (ours posted a doc with recommended textbook problems for each chapter). Try to make it to review sessions if you can. Class structure was watching lectures before class and working on problems in class with a group. Learning fellows were there to help you as well and were a great resource during class.\"",
            "review 6: \"21S with Chenfeng Ke: Professor Ke is a really chill dude, but still a pretty intense professor that didn't hold our hands by any means in the course. Sometimes, he would answer questions really well, but other times his explanations were quick and abrupt and didn't make sense to the class. Even going to office hours at times wouldn't help based on how he would explain things as just \"how they happen\" and that there wasn't much to explain them. The class itself was rigorous, so much memorization, and a lot of critical thinking that came from practice problems. We had 2 midterms (30% each), 2 quizzes (5% each), and 1 final exam (30%). There was never time to slow down, and if anything the course only picked up in speed as it went on. There was a crap ton of content to memorize--people can say all they want that knowing a mechanism is just analytical thinking, but to actually do well on his exams you should memorize some reactions and save yourself time for the free response questions. Also, the NMR and IR data to memorize was a good amount to add to my point. I really enjoyed this course, despite what a lot of people feel, but I am definitely biased and I concede that this course was insane. It is definitely a rite of passage for chem majors and premeds, but I recommend Ke as a prof and this course is highly edifying overall.\"",
            "review 7: \"21S with Chenfeng Ke: Like others, I was very scared of taking this class with Prof Ke because of last year's reviews. However, I found this class to be one of the most open and up-front / transparent classes that I've ever taken at Dartmouth. We always knew what we were expected to know, what the tricky parts were, and where we stood in relation to Prof Ke's expectations and the rest of the class. Prof Ke did everything in his power to keep people's grades up: instead of three midterms and one final, he gave us one midterm and one final, with the last 30% or so coming from weekly quizzes where he dropped low scores. This is basically equivalent to two midterms and a final, where one midterm you are guaranteed close to 100%! So while some of the course structure seemed scary going in, in actuality, Prof Ke was always on our side and trying to keep people from having to drop the class. Our biweekly in-class problem solving sessions were great and accurately reflected what sorts of questions he would test on the exam. He was always easy to reach, as were our TSF and LFs. Additionally, Prof Ke always gave us endearing words of encouragement and I personally never felt like he was impatient with us, rude, or otherwise unpleasant to learn from. I don't want to discount people's experiences from 20S because I wasn't there, but my group and everyone I've talked to from this course 1) enjoyed it as much as one could ever be expected to, considering it still is ergo and 2) practically loved Prof Ke, even though sometimes his lectures could be long and his explanations a hit-or-miss (around 75% of the time, his explanations made perfect sense and 25% of the time we'd need to repeat the question from a different angle). My review all to say, don't be afraid! Put in the work (which will take around 3 - 4 hours a day, tbh) and lean on your professors, teaching staff, and learning group for help.\"",
            "review 8: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: This class is a lot of work, but Professor Ke makes his expectations clear and that is really helpful. We knew exactly what material we would be tested on and the practice questions were very similar to what eventually showed up on the final. Your best shot is to stay on top of your work, do every practice problem until you completely understand it and watch videos on things you don't understand. For example, videos online helped me a lot with understanding the Diels-Alder reaction. Also, ideally, take this alongside 1-2 layups.\"",
            "review 9: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: To begin: Professor Ke is a super nice guy, and I find chemistry really interesting. That being said, this class brought me an astronomical amount of anxiety, stress, and moments of pure misery this fall. Since 21F was the first term back in person, we were back to the original format of orgo, which is no open note exams or quizzes. Our grade was composed of 3 exams worth 30% each (2 midterms +1 final) and 2 quizzes worth 5% each, so there was essentially zero cushion on your grade. For any review from last year that tells you there isn't a lot of memorization, IGNORE THAT. I cannot even imagine taking this class open note, it would change the entire game. Yes, orgo is about understanding mechanisms and geometry and spatial rearrangement, which are some of the things that make it super interesting. HOWEVER, with the return to in-person, there is an absolutely astronomical amount to memorize \u2014 I would say there were probably hundreds of minute details that you are expected to know for exams, and everything is closed-note. Doing the practice problems gets more helpful once you're past week 3, since before that they feel pretty irrelevant. It's also a crapshoot as to what will show up on the tests \u2014 for a class where you're expected to memorize/know an absurd amount of content, Professor Ke still manages to throw in things you've never seen before. On our second midterm, the grade breakdown was telling: pretty much everyone scored either 20 points above median or 20 points below median, since it's easy to lose points really fast on the multiple choice q's that are all or nothing, and the synthesis problem was a nightmare. If you plan on taking this class with Ke, make sure that you have a good group of people to study with, and also prepare yourself to have to relearn/restructure lecture content, since he isn't good at giving explanations or context during class. Professor Ke is a super nice guy who makes himself available after class, but our 21F class really suffered from the lack of a grad teaching fellow, and I can confidently say this is the hardest class I have ever taken at Dartmouth \u2014 by a long shot. This class is a pre-med right of passage, and my advice is to just make it through.\"",
            "review 10: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: This class does live up to its reputation. Other reviews have covered the assessments well, so I will not. Overall, I thought the Prof Ke was a decent orgo prof. I don't think that he went above and beyond by any means, but he also was not a nightmare. One thing that I loved was that he did not throw too many curveballs at us on exams \u2013 the content expectations were very clear from lectures / practice problems. However, there were many times in this course where I had to seek external help (i.e. videos online or other classmates) to fully grasp material. To succeed in this class, make sure you take a mega layup or two alongside it and be ready to help yourself out by studying a lot and diversifying your methods of taking in info (use Khan Academy!). Good luck!\"",
            "review 11: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: I think Ke was a decent professor. I was genuinely scared of his class after I found out that Ke made his class easier in 21S to accommodate for the pandemic and online learning, and that he planned to make it harder next term. However, looking back, everything was manageable with some hard work. I think the biggest part of taking Ke\u2019s class is making sure to do the textbook problems and asking lots of questions. I couldn\u2019t attend his weekly office hours so I would spend the few minutes we had before each class asking questions which he would happily answer. In terms of his testing, the course consisted of 2 5% quizzes, 2 midterms for 30% each, and a final exam also worth 30%. I think everything in terms of grading was pretty fair, but at times there were issues with TA grading. If you do have any concerns, make sure to get your points back! Otherwise, the content on every exam was pretty normal. Nothing was a curveball and I know that Ke actually threw in a few HW problems from the textbook on the exams to make sure you were doing the HW. Despite fair testing and normal content, Ke\u2019s test writing wasn\u2019t the best. Every test we took had some sort of error which he would correct on the blackboard (a lot of time which students could not see). I think the worst incident was when he told everyone that the last problem was a bonus, but realized that he printed a version of the exam without the bonus. At some point he tried to clarify that the last question wasn\u2019t actually a bonus but over half the students never heard him and he never made note of it again. It was pretty shitty for anyone who couldn\u2019t finish the test because Ke wasn\u2019t clear and printed the test improperly. Everything said, it is a very very fast paced course as expected. You have to make sure to dedicate a lot of time studying for the midterms. Overall, I definitely liked the class and would recommend Ke as a decent professor!\"",
            "review 12: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: This class was hard. If you're trying to decide what to take with it, the best answer is two layups. However, if you manage your time well and take advantage of the resources you are given it is definitely possible to do well. Professor Ke is an excellent professor overall and clearly worked hard to be transparent with what would be on exams and quizzes and everything else grade-wise. He was a pretty good teacher in regards to actually explaining content, but his style definitely fit better with some students more than others. In this class, its super important to figure out how to study best for yourself. Some kids did quizlets, some did practice problems over and over, some listened to lectures multiple times or before in-class lectures. Either way, find what works for you and make sure you set aside the time necessary to do it. In regards to labs, do prelabs with other people! They're not hard but they are monotonous and time consuming. They're much more enjoyable in a group and it really won't slow you down much. The last trick I found was going to office hours or one on one meetings with Prof. Ke. He isn't intimidating at all and he's definitely better at answering questions in a small group than in front of the whole class. Write down your questions when you do problems and then take the list to him. This strategy helped my understanding more than any other studying I did.\"",
            "review 13: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: Don't have much to say that hasn't been said already by the 21S reviewers. Ke is a nice guy, he loves making corny jokes in class about chem or about Dartmouth students partying hard. The sheer amount of material is rigorous - I probably spent 3 hours every weekday on it, and I still could've been better about doing even more of the textbook problems. I took this in a 2 course term with an easy lab class and the time commitment balanced out to the same as 3 medium-hard classes, for reference. Class was 2 midterms, 2 quizzes (5 or 10% each, can't remember), and the final. I genuinely enjoyed lab, but it is a huge time suck, especially the lab reports. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO DEDICATE TO IT.\"",
            "review 14: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: This class is not a layup in the slightest. The only reason people take this course is their chem major requirements, or their pre-med requirements; the latter of which is much more likely. The amount of content that needs to be taught in 10 weeks is ridiculous. There are recommended homework problems for each chapter, two 10 question multiple choice quizzes (5% each), two midterms (30% each), and a cumulative final (30%). Quiz 1, midterm 1, and quiz 2 are very manageable. Midterm 2 is an insane amount of memorization and many of the questions were much more difficult than the homework problems. Office hours with Ke were helpful. He also had 1-on-1 appointments, however, almost as soon as they opened up, they were booked. The lab portion is pretty manageable, especially if you have a good TA and you like the people in the hoods around you.\"",
            "review 15: \"21F with Chenfeng Ke: Ok\u2026 I\u2019ve got mixed feelings about this class. I was so terrified to take this class, and I was certain that it was gonna be worse than I was expecting. Nonetheless, it was exactly as bad as I had previously imagined (guess this is a good thing since it didn\u2019t startle me as much). I didn\u2019t think the first 4 weeks were as bad neither the first midterm. However, as we got to chapter 7, things started to go downhill (a lot of reactions to memorize and so on). Professor Ke is a nice lad but I was constantly confused in class. As a result, I stopped paying attention to the lecture as weeks went by, and tbh it didn\u2019t affect me that much. Lab: literally the most dreadful part of this class (at least for me). I had the Thursday section (please keep in mind that all of our midterms and quizzes were on a Thursday). This implied that I used to spend the ENTIRE day on Wednesday watching prelab videos, finishing my postlab from the previous week, and handwriting my prelab entries (worst part ever because you need to be as detailed as possible in order to be able to conduct the experiment in person. Please ignore the remote lab reviews. It\u2019s completely different in person). After a 4-hour lab session surrounded by people that couldn\u2019t stop talking about rushing, I still had to manage to have energy to take a 2-hour midterm. The good part about lab this term is that the TAs are genuinely nice and grading isn\u2019t too bad. Also, we don\u2019t have a huge final project like for chem 5,6. Exams: The exam questions are significantly harder than the recommended book exercises (especially synthesis). I dowloaded another book for synthesis and did all of the exercises (helped me a lot!!). Quizzes: they are bad, but not too bad! Just take your time and dont rush. Piece of advice: don\u2019t let your colleagues freak you out about how much they understand the material or how many hours/week they are studying. Try not to get behind, and watch video lectures (learning simply channel saved me). Definitely one of the worst 10 weeks of my life, but I knew what I was signing up for when I decided to be premed. Good luck\"",
            "review 16: \"20S with Chenfeng Ke: Prof Ke is the worst professor I've ever had. There are not enough examples I can give to stress how incompetent and unsympathetic this guy is. His lectures were so rambling and confusing \u2013 he just jumped from concept to concept by writing them down and moving on without explaining what it meant \u2013 that I would always have to read the entire textbook afterward because otherwise I\u2019d be completely lost. He is also blatantly rude to his students and doesn\u2019t seem to care about helping them succeed. When people ask him clarifying questions about content, instead of clarifying or explaining, he shoots back that we should rewatch the lecture because he\u2019s already explained it and doesn\u2019t want to do it again. Leading up to the final, he refused to answer any questions outside class that weren\u2019t \u201cyes or no\u201d questions, because it takes him too much time to think about the answer and write it down if it\u2019s too complicated. The exams were completely out of left field and he barely gives any partial credit. If you can avoid Ke, definitely do.\"",
            "review 17: \"20S with Chenfeng Ke: Prof Ke's lecture and class style definitely suffered from being remote. Prof. Ke was impersonal, difficult to understand (he has a very strong Chinese accent that was difficult to understand at first - is he saying alkane, alkene, or alkyne?), and singularly fixated on achieving an acceptable grade distribution in the class (he often spent the first 10-15 minutes of mandatory class problem solving talking about grade related subjects instead of teaching). Additionally, I would agree with previous reviews that parts of the exams were pretty difficult and required extending the rules learned in lecture and in the book to new situations we had genuinely never seen before (I for one had trouble with the questions in exam 1 and quiz 2 which required acid catalyzed sigma bond shifts). However, I don't think that Ke's class was completely awful, and it is distinctly possible that the unusual circumstances of the Corona led to the class being more difficult/annoying than usual. Firstly, I don't think that the exams were inherently unfair or demonstrated that Ke was some sort of sadist who enjoyed torturing students who were struggling in class. In fact, it would appear that Ke was extremely concerned that students would be ill prepared for the next class in the Orgo series or try to take it easy, which would lead to them failing when normal grading resumed (while he likely over-corrected for this concern during the exams, it didn't mean that he included impossible questions in the exams or that he was a big bad meanie). Furthermore, when I interacted with Ke over email and by zoom (he agreed to a private meeting to go over some concerns I had with the exam), he was very willing to help answer my questions and even changed significant portions of the key to quiz 2 (including more answers as correct than he had before) based on my comments. Overall, Ke's class was a very mixed bag, if you have to take a course online with Ke I would urge you to avoid it. However, based on my personal interaction with Prof. Ke and things I've heard from his previous students, real life classes are most likely better.\"",
            "review 18: \"20S with Chenfeng Ke: This man. This incompetent potato. Where do I begin?I thought I had seen the worst of the chem department with Katherine Mirica, but Ke is worse. We all knew we were in for a ride when he told us in office hours that \u201cYou can\u2019t use COVID as an excuse for everything. I\u2019m going through this too, so I know what\u2019s a struggle and what\u2019s not.\u201d Oh boy. It started out fine, he was an eh lecturer, kind of mumbling to himself sometimes, but usually pretty clear. First quiz was supposed to be pretty easy and had an 85 median. The second exam was a huge step up, dropping the median down to 75, and everyone used the full FOUR HOURS to complete the exam. He told us it would take two, but that is a straight up lie. I don\u2019t know anybody who finished in 2. However, at this point in the class I was feeling okay. Yes, the exam was super long, but I felt relatively speaking for orgo it wasn\u2019t horrific. His synthesis problems were kind of a stretch, but the rest of it was basically stuff we\u2019d learned and whatnot. It was what I expected for organic chemistry at Dartmouth. Then, the third quiz happened and he destroyed us with a 68% median. Doesn\u2019t sound too horrible for chem, but according to the TA, a little under half the class did not pass the exam. A good chunk of people didn\u2019t finish even with the four hour time window. And this was purposeful-he wanted a 65 median because he felt there was cheating during the second exam (which, we\u2019re online, so yes there totally was, but he still got a 75 median so that\u2019s a thought bubble). However, in his attempt to make this exam \u2018cheat proof\u2019 he used so many bizarre regeants and stereochemistry that it was basically just a guessing game. Professor Ke thinks that anyone who\u2019s not doing well is just not trying hard enough-yes he told us this. Failed an exam? You probably didn\u2019t go to lecture (spoiler alert; his lectures literally were horrible towards the end). Most students in my study group had stopped listening to his lectures and were using a variety of outside resources to learn because he had just lost it by the end of term-he explains nothing and is basically chemistry sparknotes. He gives 0 practice problems. He gave us about 5 per exam and told us he wouldn\u2019t do that if we weren\u2019t online, so ouch. The book problems were fine for testing if you understood the concepts, but his synthesis problems are such a stretch from the material you\u2019re given that it\u2019s like being smacked in the face every time. I don\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re unreasonable problems for Dartmouth orgo, but he\u2019s such a bad prof that we were learning nothing. He\u2019s also just a jerk overall and does not care about students, which would be tolerable if he wasn\u2019t a bad prof who purposely gave exams to fail us. Now I know that sometimes people exaggerate about exam difficulty, especially in chemistry. However. Never before in my entire existence in the STEM departments have I ever felt so personally attacked by an exam as I did by his second quiz and final. I could literally sense his desire to see us all FAIL in every single question. You might think I\u2019m joking, but I literally saw on every question how he had designed it with the purpose of tanking the entire class. If you needed extra assistance in this class, I\u2019m so sorry for you. He is out to get you, and he does not care if you fail. He plays favorites, and is frankly pretty hostile in office hours. If we hadn\u2019t been taking this pass fail, I would have had a mental breakdown. I want to believe that if we were on campus, the exams would have been more reasonable simply because he would have had a lower median than 75 on the second exam, which would have made him happy and so the failing of our class wouldn\u2019t have been necessary. However, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that good of a person. The only saving grace in this whole terrible experience were the grad TAs (who are the only reason I passed any exam because Ke\u2019s office hours were a literal joke-see the other reviews) and Welder\u2019s lab. Welder was a kind soul who actually met with me the first couple weeks because I needed extra help with course material and ended up providing additional material for us when Ke couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain Acids and Bases. Moral of the story: This man is terrible. Like a league of his own terrible. This is a prime example of someone who should just return to purely research and stop torturing undergrads because he shouldn\u2019t be a professor. I don\u2019t even think he enjoys teaching us. And tbh, it\u2019s kind of sad. I actually think orgo is pretty interesting and I might have enjoyed it if I hadn\u2019t been stuck with him.\"",

That being said, this class was a dumpster fire. As much as I wanted to believe Ke really cared about the class and was just insanely stressed, his pattern of consistently refusing the reasonable requests students had throughout the term makes me think he doesn't care. His exams were brutal, like had me in tears while taking them brutal, mostly because we were not adequately prepared for them. Prof. Ke said we should do the textbook problems to prepare for the exams, and guess what. I did every. single. damn. textbook problem, and still felt woefully underprepared for his exams, even when the textbook problems came easily to me. However, every time students asked him to release his own practice questions that more closely resembled the exam questions, Ke just doubled down and said the textbook problems were enough practice.\""

I liked Wu a lot on a personal level, he is awkward but a nice guy and often gave good explanations for concepts one-on-one. But, given how much of a genius Wu is, he can sometimes come off abrasive since he doesn't understand why a student would not immediately grasp some of the concepts. This felt discouraging at times since the material did not come naturally to me. This class was EXTREMELY difficult, moreso than your average orgo class and from what I have gathered, more than other CHEM 51 courses. The amount of time I put into this class to barely scrape by with a grade above a C was absurd\u2013\u2013doing all practice problems multiple times, going to peer tutoring, and every single office hours with Prof. Wu. Having enjoyed CHEM 5/6, this class was nothing like those other courses. Lab was fine, it's honestly overhyped. Prep for labs is time consuming, and the experiments themselves are exhausting, but when it comes down to it, it is unlikely that lab will impact your grade. Welder is scary at first but if you come to her for help she is honestly very supportive.\"",

They are very fair and people who complain about the low medians (mid 70\u2019s) don\u2019t understand that most chem department courses have low medians (to allow for a better curve). If you don\u2019t understand the basics of chem early on (pKa, electron pushing, resonance) then you will struggle with this class but otherwise I thought the time commitment was very reasonable. The labs suck and \u201cDr.\u201d Welder is probably one of the worst chem department faculty members. She feeds off the tears of premed students who mess up reactions, and is overall ill equipped towards being nice.

It is not one of my natural interests and it is not one of my strengths. The good news is that because I was willing to work very hard and devote the necessary hours, and because Professor Wu is also willing to work very hard and devote time to his students, I was able to learn, and even get a good grade. Professor Wu is organized, intelligent, motivated and unwilling to tolerate fools. That means if you put in effort, so will he. If you don't, he has no pity for you. This seems to be a fair stance for a science prof. Lab was painful and six hours long, but I happened to get the most awesome TA ever, which was helpful. The typed lab write-ups are due at the beginning of the next lab period. The TAs are graded are required to grade them on a normal grade distribution. The typing, the formal format, and the need for a grade distribution were all innovations this term and seemed both unnecessary and grossly unfair. For one thing, lab work had no connection with the material we were covering in class. In addition to lab, there were three exams and a cumulative final. The third exam was right before thanksgiving and the final right after thanksgiving, which also seemed stressful to no good purpose. Also, be aware that all exams are scheduled without regard to anything else happening on campus-- if you are rushing or celebrate halloween over the weekend for instance, there is no mercy for you. If this is a required course for you, you know better than to expect an easy ride. However, if you must take it, I can highly recommend Professor Wu. You won't find a better prof, although the course will always be demanding.\"",

That said, the material is not that difficult (and kind of interesting!), and if you have a lot of time and determination on your hands an A is achievable. The work comes with the amount of practice you need in order to do well on the exams. It's not enough to just understand the concepts, you need to become familiar with the reactions and how to manipulate them, and that is best done through lots of practice problems. If you've taken Chem, you already know this, but be aware that that there is no homework grade. The grade is based on your scores on 4 exams.

It's really important to keep up with the readings - I usually got more from the book than I did from lectures. Doing a lot of problems also helps a lot.

The book is nice during the first half of the class, garbage for the second half. The past problems/exams better reflect the format of the exams. Group studying helps a lot!

The exams were almost every 2 weeks, but were manageable in the 2.5 hrs given. The median got lower and lower though with each exam, reaching the 60s I think. Professor Wu was a bit shaky at first in lectures, but that could be because he's pretty new in teaching this course. He understands the material well, even though he at first made errors in class and couldn't answer some questions.

There's a lot of difficult material, and all of your classmates will be just as hard-working as you, so it takes a lot to get an A. But you probably already knew that. J-Wu is not the best professor. He doesn't seem to have a perfect grasp of all the material and can get confused during class. It's evident that he cares a lot about teaching and really wants his students to learn the material - he's just not that good at accomplishing this. But hey, he's still a newbie; give him another year or two and he may become a great prof. The coursework and readings are very interesting in parts - unfortunately, these are not the parts that you are tested on. Organic chemistry is less about understanding why and how chemical reactions occur and more about applying rules and memorizing reactions. If that appeals to you, great - I found that it removed all the beauty and wonder from science. But you're probably going to take this course regardless, so here's what I've learned about how to do well: do the problems. Early in the year, J-Wu said we should do ALL the problems from the book. I thought, \"Bullshit, who's ever gonna do all the problems?\" Turns out a lot of people really did ALL the problems. While that may be a little excessive, you should at least glance through most of the problems. Reading the chapters will teach you a lot about organic chemistry; doing the problems will teach you how to do well on the tests. It's a worthy investment of your time.\""

He definitely seems pretty pumped about the material 100% of the time. This was Wu's first class I believe, and think that his confidence was a little shaky in front of 100 students/occasionally started rambling about somewhat insignificant details that took up a lot of classtime. He definitely knows his stuff, but still needs to better navigate effective teaching strategies. So put in the time, and if you think you may not be putting in enough time, you probably aren't.

Your grade is determined by the following assessments: 9 quizzes (15%, but you drop your two worst grades), 2 midterms (25% each), final (35%), and lab. Lab sucks and most likely will contribute nothing substantial to your grade. It's treated as a kind of extra credit where if you do well, you can get an additional 1-5% added to your grade, but if you do poorly, it decreases your grade by 1-5%. Most people receive no addition or subtraction from their grade (+0%), and any increases or decreases are difficult to obtain. My recommendation is to BS your way through the lab, going for a +0%, and focus entirely on tests and quizzes, (Sandford subtly recommended this as well). Sandford prepares you well for all assessments with problem sessions and access to old tests and old problem sessions from previous years. Use them effectively, as they are the only way to really get an idea of where you are at. The first midterm and final had a 77% median, and the second midterm had an 80% median. The class ended with a 79% median. The median is always a B+, but the other grade cutoffs were never specified. Orgo has a pretty bad reputation, but Sandford definitely makes the class much more enjoyable and easier than others.\"",

The final was much harder than the midterms, but that was partly because this was his first term teaching the class.\""

I have never struggled more in any other class, and I think a lot of this was due to her teaching style. Her lectures are confusing and rushed, she did not record lectures despite student requests for her to, and the exams were extremely unfair. The exams tested material that we had not yet learned, were too long (one lasted over 5 hours), and the exam medians were around a 50. She seems like a nice person and tried to reassure students throughout the term, but these reassurances were limited to telling us not to worry about grades (while simultaneously giving us horrible grades) and telling us not to stress about memorizing every fact and detail (but then testing us on the very things she said not to worry about memorizing). She is incredibly smart and amazing at organic chemistry, but this leads to an inability to understand our struggle to learn it; she says concepts are easy to learn and problems easy to solve and gets frustrated when we can't do things that seem easy to her. Overall, I had a terrible experience in this class.\"",
            "review 2: \"20F with Pushpa Venkatesan: When I think of Pushpa, one tweet comes to mind: \"Professors be like 'I know these are troubling times' then be the trouble during the times\". This tweet nicely sums up the essence of taking CHEM 51 with Pushpa during a pandemic. The date is December 15th, 2020, the day when MEDIANS are posted, and grades have not been released yet. The tests are extraordinarily long, but in her defense it's not her fault. People keep asking for extensions during the test, and she extends them by a few hours, and then people complain about the tests being too long. To be fair, we could just leave, so don't worry too much about the length of the tests. She finally didn't extend the final and then it wasn't enough time, so we really paid that price. Can we all just get As? I hope she reads this. Anyway, back to her teaching. She's nice I guess, but it's fake and frustrating. She says, \"I don't care about grades\" and then proceeds to make the medians around a 50. The tests are extraordinarily difficult and not represent of the MCAT. It's good if you want to continue studying organic chem after undergrad, but I cannot think of a single person who would want to do this after taking chemistry with her. If you want to take this class, prepare to read the textbook and work through problems for 3+ hours every day. Orgo is a difficult class, to be fair, but Pushpa makes it so much worse.

It seemed that after the first or second exam that she might have gotten the message and shortened the exams. She also didn't show much interest in examining the fact that her expectation of how much the students should know and how fast they should be able to work didn't match students actual level of understanding. If you assign a 2.5 hour exam and then have to extend the time to 5 hours it seems like you didn't really understand where your student's understanding was at. She would repeatedly tell us that \"if you know understand the material well the exams shouldn't be hard at all.\" Obviously that is not worth stating. You could tell that she tried to be nice and decrease student stress, but unfortunately just telling students to \"not feel stressed about the material\" doesn't do much without any accompanying action. Her lectures were often disorganized and always very rushed. She commonly used review sessions to go over additional information and would simply post screenshots of the content to Piazza. I'm not sure if she was trying to teach the honors curriculum or what, but it simply made a tough class even harder than it needed to be.

I genuinely believe she is a nice person that wants her students to succeed, but she blames any low scores or misunderstandings on us and refuses to adjust her teaching style. Her lectures are VERY disorganized and she spends a lot of time going over simple concepts, leaving very little time for more complex ideas, and she refuses to record them even though students are in a variety of time zones right now. She says she looks for basic understanding and not mastery, but many times on my exams the TAs would give me partial credit for being on the right track, only for her to come back through and write a big fat zero. Overall, she just seems out of touch, and I almost cried when I saw she is also teaching CHEM52 in 21W.

She goes really fast in class though, and expects that you read the chapters (and attempt the textbook problems) before we do them in class, so this class is a ton of work - then again, it is orgo. Venkatesan is also super accessible on Piazza, which turned out to be a huge resource as well. She said she wasn't going to curve the class in the beginning, however at the end what she did is just change the grade boundaries so that 87+ was an A, etc. Really, I did learn a lot in this class and I think Venkatesan was a good prof who really wants her students to do well, but my one complaint was the exams - we had three midterms and a final, like other orgo classes, but every. single. exam. was twice as long as it was supposed to be as listed on the syllabus - our final exam was six hours long. So, in total we had somewhere around 18 hours of testing :( Other than that, it was honestly a decent orgo class.

The downside of taking this class with Aprahamian is that he is very new, so he doesn't have the confidence or authority to bend the rules. For example, his exams were all on Friday nights and he would not change this unless you had an academic or health-related conflict.

We had 3 midterms (each was worth 25% and she drops the lowest one) and a final worth 40% of our grade). However, she is not dropping one next year, so there will be 2 midterms and a final (I think).

The structure of the course went through a major overhaul. Instead of teaching materials in the 2006 order, Professor Kull decided to switch it up and teach metabolism first. I felt this made the course much better as you could understand what Professor Kull was actually talking about later on when we did enzyme kinetics. There were two things that I found difficult about this course. First, learning and memorizing all of the enzymes and metabolic pathways took serious effort. Second, the pace of the material is fast since the course was originally intended to be two terms long. The third test and the final were just a week apart, although the final was really just a fourth exam. Professor Kull has a good sense of humor and often reminisces about the \"old days.\" Going to class is unnecessary to learn the material but I went anyway because the material was interesting. Professor Kull also interspersed his lectures with overheads from more recent scientific magazines and journals to supplement his own unpublished work (dubbed the Green Thing). The material was further reinforced by the Biochemistry textbook offered at Wheelock Books. In conclusion, if you have a serious interest in biochemistry, you will probably learn alot from this class. If not, this class can be difficult as you might feel like you are memorizing stuff just to do well on the tests, and then forgetting the material afterwards. If the pace of the course is too fast, you could always take Biochemistry through the Biology department in two terms.\"",

We just received a list of questions to prepare answers to (which worked out on average to be 20 pages that we had to memorize), then regurgitated those during the exams.

There are very detailed study questions and the exam is writrten verbatim from a small selection of them.

            "review 1: \"19F with Dean Wilcox: I took AP Chemistry in high school and thought that I might know some of the material already from some chemistry research that I had done, but there were a lot of topics that I didn't know and I found them really challenging. I'm not interested in chemistry as a major (or really at all) and simply wanted to take this class in place of Chem 6 to fulfill pre-med prerequisites. I found that most of my classmates were really passionate about chemistry while I was not. It is a huge time commitment, and I personally found the workload to be overwhelming at times. That being said, while I probably could have planned better for studying around exams, this class took over my life fall term. I took it in combination with Math 11, which is something you should only do if you're very confident in your skills and are prepared to spend the majority of your time studying for these two classes (I was not the only one who did this). However, Professor Wilcox was wonderful and is very dedicated to his students. I enjoyed our lab and especially appreciated that he offered many office hours and additional review sessions around exams. The first few weeks were pretty tough, but it definitely got easier as the course went on. Our grades on the midterm (2) and final exams were not curved until final grades were released, but Professor Wilcox was very generous with the curve. If you are genuinely interested in this class, by all means take it! Just know that we aren't kidding when we say it will be challenging. Another note: the small class size was definitely a perk of taking the honors class. My friends in Chem 5 & 6 were in huge classes compared to our group of ~30, and I met some really cool people through Chem 10! We all supported each other and studied together a lot which was wonderful to have during my first term at Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 2: \"19F with Dean Wilcox: Chem 10... what an interesting experience. I took 3 years of chem in high school through the IB program\u2013 MYP chem and then chem HL (7); I also challenged the AP chem exam after my first year of chem HL and got a 5. However, the first 2 weeks of this course were unbelievably difficult for me\u2013 there was an emphasis on physics that took me by surprise, especially given that I have no physics background. However, the entire class was super friendly and collaborative, which motivated me to ask for help during office hours and made me feel less unsure of myself. Eventually, the material became easier and by the second half of the course, I knew I made the right decision even though I was still being challenged (we moved away from quantum mechanics toward more familiar topics like kinetics and electrochemistry). Professor Wilcox is amazing and incredibly dedicated to his students\u2013 his in-class demonstrations are engaging and he even scheduled optional \"y\" and \"z\" hours for us to review as a class before midterms and the final! Exams were difficult but reasonable in my opinion, and the lab was time-consuming but worthwhile and well-organized. Also, it is easy to fall behind if you are not a self-motivated learner, as problem sets are not graded but helpful if you want to do well on the exams. Even though I struggled, I am glad I took this course and I would choose to take it again if I could go back in time. Just be aware that this class is a huge time commitment, from studying to completing labwork to attending X, \"Y,\" and \"Z,\" hours, and the material is fast-paced and challenging.\"",

A lot of the kids in the class dedicate their lives to it, so if you aren't down for that, be careful. Still, Prof. Wilcox is awesome and made the class very dynamic and fun. My class got pretty close and we all died together. Only complaint is that there is very little use of Canvas, so it's impossible to know how you are doing in the class during the term.\"",

As for the prof - Wilcox is one of the best of the chem department I've had so far. Very accommodating and willing to explain concepts. If you take this class in person, he'll even do fun demonstrations! Also shoutout to the GOAT lab TA Sarah C.\"",
            "review 5: \"19F with Dean Wilcox: I wrote the placement exam for Chem 10 because my school didn't offer AP but the placement test is WAY too easy for the course. I would not recommend Chem 10 unless you are super confident about your chemistry and math knowledge. The class had some of the smartest students at Dartmouth and we all struggled. The problem sets usually seemed impossibly theoretical, especially at the beginning of the course. Even after taking 5 other difficult STEM classes at Dartmouth, none of them have come close to the difficulty of chem 10. Also, most students concurrently take/have already taken multivariable calculus, which really helps. If you are on the fence about this class, don't take it. It's meant for super eager future chemistry majors. However, that being said Wilcox is an amazing professor and did his best to make the concepts understandable. It's also much smaller class that chem 5 (about 30 students compared to 100+) and he had regular office hours where he was excited to meet his students. Wilcox also scheduled extra class time when we needed extra help (often before exams). The labs are long and require a lot of pre-lab work, but they helped me raise my grade from the exams (which were extremely difficult). The curve was very generous, though, so getting an A or A- is not impossible.\"",

Doing problem sets and coming to office hours are a huge help, and I definitely wish I had taken advantage of that more. The class starts with some of the conceptually most difficult content, then progresses to more grounded topics that are more closely linked to AP chem. I found labs to be helpful for the course material, although they were long and writing the formal lab report was challenging. Tests (2 midterms and a final) are very hard (the class average was about 74% on all three) and make up the majority of the final grade, but Prof. Wilcox ended up giving us a good median grade. Overall a good class, but know what you're getting into before you enroll.\"",
            "review 7: \"18F with Dean Wilcox: In my opinion, the most difficult topic in this course was quantum mechanics. This topic threw me into the course, and I actually considered dropping it. This course requires a lot of time outside of class. Professor Wilcox will only assign two graded homeworks (which are pretty simple), and problem sets which are not graded. I wouldn't say I'm naturally skilled at chemistry like some of my classmates were, so I made sure I did all the problem sets (many students didn't), did more practice problems besides that, read all the sections in the textbook that aligned with class lectures, and basically went to all of Professor Wilcox's office hours. This was a huge time commitment, but I think it paid off. Professor Wilcox is super nice and really, really willing to help (I want to emphasize that), and I feel like I really understood the material during his office hours when I could get one-on-one help and not feel embarrassed for asking seemingly simple questions. At first, his explanations were too high-level for me to really help, but as the course went on, his explanations started to become more helpful (either because he realized I needed more basic explanations, the course material got easier, or both). There are definitely people in the class who love chemistry, and it comes to them naturally, but there is also a good amount of people for whom chemistry is not intuitive. I thought Professor Wilcox was a great professor, and I really liked how he taught by writing everything down on the board instead of using pre-made slides. This helped me to learn and remember concepts better. He also starts every class by reviewing previous concepts. This was also very, very helpful. He derives almost every equation, which I found interesting but made the course unnecessarily more difficult. I felt that the labs didn't really help me understand class material (they sometimes confused me more), and they took so much time. Pre-labs and post-labs take time if you actually put in the effort, and the lab report was so tedious and time-consuming. The midterms and finals are really difficult, and I'm still not sure if there is a curve for this course. Overall, I learned a lot and am glad I took this course but realize this class requires work, time, and dedication.\"",
            "review 8: \"18F with Dean Wilcox: This class was my favorite of the fall, gave me a new appreciation for chemistry, and also will be the most likely to tank my GPA for far longer than the fall. I would strongly advise anyone interested in the course to think about how much of a \"chem person\" they are before enrolling. Most of the super-chem people in the freshmen class will enroll and then comprise the top 1/3 to 1/2 of the class. I'm so grateful to have been with a group that was excited about chem but quickly realized that some people have a chemical intuition that I don't have. So I studied a ton - more than my other two classes combined. This is not to say that I did well, either - just better because of the insane time commitment, especially before midterms. This bears repeating. It is very possible to study hard and study smart and still do poorly. This is especially the case for the first units because they're the only ones that are not extensions of AP Chem material. The class does get easier, content-wise, over the course of the term. Exams do not. Dean is great. Class is so compressed that we do very few problems in lecture and lectures can sometimes be proof-heavy and confusing. Going to office hours generally cleared things up. The labs that we used were generally useful. I wish lab had been worth more to make it proportional to the amount of time it took. If you are considering a STEM major but aren't certain, NRO the class. The course is such a great learning experience but damn I wish I NRO'd.

            "review 12: \"08F with Dean Wilcox: I took this class as an alternative to taking Chem 6 in the spring (I placed out of Chem 5 with AP credit) and I'm glad I did. For one, the class was only 25 students compared to 100+ in other intro classes. The setting was more intimate, and I do feel like there was more ability to ask questions and talk to the prof individually, both during lectures and after class. Also, I had the impression that Chem 10, while definitely challenging, is in some ways less work than Chem 5/6, as we only had homework assignments (5 problems, worth 1 point each) every 2 weeks or so rather than problem sets due more frequently. There were no online assignments (webwork, etc). In that way, the class was more geared towards independent learning (i.e., if you wanted to keep up you'd have to do readings on your own, even if they weren't assigned or quizzed on), which can be good or bad depending on how you work. Personally, I liked that I was able to turn away from chem sometimes in order to focus on other schoolwork and be able to catch up later, but regardless it was a very fast paced course, so the time frame for catching up was small. The tests were very challenging and sometimes drew from topics we had encountered in lab but hadn't really studied in depth in class, which was frustrating. Prof. Wilcox was very gracious in assigning partial credit, though. He also gave us a LOT of time for the tests (though to be fair the tests definitely required every extra minute to be completed in). Wilcox put a lot of effort into preparing us for the exams, though. He provided a lot of review material (practice problems) in addition to holding review sessions the night before the exam. The material itself is pretty challenging, too. It helps to have a background in chem (AP or IB), but even so the course goes into MUCH more detail than most classes in high school do. Basically, you're learning the why's and how's and the details of various formulas/phenomena that high school teachers just told you to accept at face value and assume to be true. And even so, there's a lot of very complex chem that Prof. Wilcox told us to just take his word on because it was too complex to explain at the intro gen chem level. Wilcox is an interesting lecturer. Sometimes it's hard to follow the flow of his talks when he goes into lengthy proofs to demonstrate various topics (which you don't really have to know for the exams/hw), but it's interesting on a conceptual level and helps you get a better idea of the mechanics of the math involved in chemistry, for example. He is definitely passionate about what he does, and it reflects in his teaching. He supplements a lot of his lectures by talking about real-life applications or performing demonstrations or talking about related research in the chem department. Oh and he also has ridiculously cool stories about famous chemists/scientists he's either worked with, studied under, or met through his profs. Huge names in chemistry. It's awesome. Wilcox is really accessible by blitz and during office hours, and he's great at explaining things one-on-one. I'm glad I took this course 1) because I got my gen chem requirement out of the way early on and 2) I learned a lot and have a pretty solid foundation in basic topics.\"",

I spent way more time and effort on this class than any other, because it was paced so quickly! We probably covered all of thermodynamics over the course of two days. Welcome to Dartmouth! Professor Wilcox is both a crutch and an adversary. On one hand, he apparently finds the subject matter to be way easier than anyone in the class. Now whenever I hear someone say \"straightforward\", I cringe a little bit. He had tendency to give a flood of problems to do all at once after a week of no assignments at all. The graded homework assignments were a little too sparse and too hard, and on midterms we were caught off guard by material that had only appeared in labs. Also, just a pet peeve, his numbering of bullet points in lecture was far from consistent and sometimes hard to follow. Wilcox is incredibly accessible outside of class, however, especially when he held review sessions before midterms and the final that lasted until every question was answered. He also is very clearly passionate about the subject, often mentioning on historical side notes that were applicable to the topics at hand. For midterms, Wilcox gave the class up to an hour of extra time. The bad news, the time was usually necessary. Probably more significant than the academic aspect of this class is how freakin' dangerous it is. Wilcox is a chemistry maniac, once pricking his finger for blood and using it as an example enzyme in a lecture on kinetics. In another demonstration, a stopper was fired into the audience after Wilcox essentially aimed it at his students. Maybe the class of 2012 was just very unlucky in their hazardous activities, but the class of 2013 is next! Overall, this was a hard and stressful class that takes less time to complete than Chem 5 and 6, mostly because it's compressed so much.

It was extremely difficult to keep up. Though all the problems the profs assign are entirely optional (aka not graded), if you don't do every problem and try your hardest to understand them, you're out of luck, because just reading the text book and taking good notes won't cut it for this class. I found that I worked at a pace of about three problems and hour, and it was frustrating. This class ate up my afternoons and weekends, but in the end I did well. It did make me miss out on more fun things than I care to admit, but it's over now and I got two chem courses out of the way in one term. However, if you're not planning on being a chem or biochem major, you might want to pick the more liesurely 5-6 sequence. Though enrollment in chem 10 is under 40 students which made for great camaraderie, which is really really nice, and Lipson and Wilcox are really enthusiastic profs. To sum it all up, if you take this class: GO TO OFFICE HOURS, DO ALL THE PROBLEMS, GO TO ALL THE CLASSES, READ THE CHAPTERS, AND STUDY LIKE HELL.\"",

Even if you do all the book problems, the stuff on the test sometimes seems like it's from another class. On top of all that, everyone else in the class is very, very good at chemistry, so it's not as easy as you might think to beat the class average. On the plus side, after taking Chem 10, everything, including the legendarily difficult Organic Chemistry, seems okay. Also, Chem 10 counts as credit for Chem 5 and 6 (I hear the non-honors general chem isn't much fun, either). Science classes at Dartmouth are hard.

Most stem majors require chem 5 and chem 6 OR the pair's equivalent (chem 10). If you are in a position to take chem 10, term spacing does not matter (chem 6 and chem 10 take up only one term each). One of your considerations should be class size. Chem 10 only has about 30 people while chem 6 can get to be much larger. Chem 10 also moves at a very fast pace, but I've heard that chem 6 is arguably harder because the professor who teaches it (at least in 17F) incorporates calculus into the content.

With regards to labs, I found them a little irksome.

You're not held accountable for the homework, so it's up to you as to how much effort you want to put into this class. BelBruno's lectures could get a bit dry, but were usually pretty good. Sometimes he'd even bring in demonstrations to explain concepts we were learning.

I had a choice between this and chem 6, and I chose this because I felt I could get more individual attention and that there would be a bit of review-so much for that, out the window! Also, his tests are devilishly hard, if not because the questions are impossible, but because ther's not enough time in the course to explain the concepts in the detail they are presented in the tests.

He really picks out and focuses on the topics of chemistry that you only superficially cover in high school, and I definitely learned a lot in class. It is an accelerated class (chem 5+6 in one). So how this class works is that the prof. assumes that you already know much of the material in chem 5. The class is really chem 6 + some of chem 5 that you cover on your own. At times, you do feel as if the class is moving by really quickly, but as long as you catch up on the weekends, you should be fine.

If you placed out of Chem 5, I feel like Chem 10 really isn't that much of a stretch, especially since the grading seems to be a lot more lenient for Chem 10 compared to Chem 6. Professor Robustelli is a pretty fair grader and keeps things on the higher side average-wise. He's not good at explaining concepts as he isn't a super concise person so the line between what you need to know and his own fun facts and tangents is very blurred, often leaving me very confused. I was not a fan of our textbook, I would skim it but rely on other online resources instead, they help a lot and are definitely worth spending extra time on. I felt really anxious when taking the midterms because there really isn't much to reference before taking them in terms of what to expect wording or difficulty-wise. The only other assignments - the graded problem sets - do not test the challenging concepts that would inevitably show up on the midterms so they're really just grade inflators, which could be nice, but I found them to just take up extra time. Labs took like 2 hours a week for me, but it really wasn't that bad, especially since the pandemic hindered us from actually having to conduct the labs in person (we were given all the data).

            "review 4: \"09F with Joseph BelBruno: Belbruno's a nice enough guy. He can be pretty awkward, and his lectures get fairly dull sometimes. A lot of the time, for this class, he would get so bogged down in deriving formulas that he wouldn't actually explain key concepts to us very well, or we wouldn't be able to tell what was important in the ocean of chalk he had just painted in front of us. I had a choice between this and chem 6, and I chose this because I felt I could get more individual attention and that there would be a bit of review-so much for that, out the window! Also, his tests are devilishly hard, if not because the questions are impossible, but because ther's not enough time in the course to explain the concepts in the detail they are presented in the tests. Overall, I'd say this was my least favorite course freshman fall, and I'd take Chem 6 if I did it again.\"",

            "review 6: \"09F with Joseph BelBruno: This was an invaluable class to be this fall term, because of the content that prof. BelBruno decided to include in the course. He's very reasonable about what he thinks the students can/cannot handle, and I liked how he began with quantum mechanics right off the bat, almost like a good equalizer, because most of the people hadn't been exposed to that in depth. He really picks out and focuses on the topics of chemistry that you only superficially cover in high school, and I definitely learned a lot in class. It is an accelerated class (chem 5+6 in one). So how this class works is that the prof. assumes that you already know much of the material in chem 5. The class is really chem 6 + some of chem 5 that you cover on your own. At times, you do feel as if the class is moving by really quickly, but as long as you catch up on the weekends, you should be fine. What you get out of the class (the experience, content, and grade) all depend on how much time you put into it. The class caused me to consider taking more courses in the chemistry department.\"",

(The only material that I can say was almost wholly new was the wave function stuff.) So it was pretty much a snorefest. Onto the logistical difficulties: -Tests: WAY TOO LONG, IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IN THE TIME ALLOTTED. The prof had to give us an extra HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES to do a supposedly 2-hour-long 2nd midterm, and 97%+ of the class was still there scribbling madly at the end. And guess what, the final was something like 50% LONGER. For only three and a half hours. For me, this does not compute. It almost seemed to be testing our strategizing skills more than our command of the material. I don't care if we get a curve on crack; I'd rather be able to finish the tests. -Textbook: Indistinguishable from my AP Chem text. It might even have been a later edition of the same book, my sense of deja vu was THAT strong. Beg, borrow, or steal this thing from somebody, but do not--I repeat, DO NOT--waste your money. Neither the readings nor the problems went into as much depth as the material we were learning in lecture (for us, anyway, I think it was different for the other section *hinthint*), and did not help at all with preparing us for the tests, except maybe on a making-sure-we-knew-the-basic-concepts level. -Problem sets: Most problems were from the textbook (waste of time), a few were written by the prof (not enough of these). He also refused to give us practice tests for the 2nd midterm and the final, saying that the lecture problems (the ones written by the prof) were largely taken from previous tests. Like I said, not enough practice at the level of mastery the tests expected us to display. -Lectures: Write fast, because the prof has this unfortunate habit of finishing writing something on a board, then erasing that same board (without regard for what he just finished writing) and writing more stuff on it. Also, you can pretty much ignore the top half or two-thirds of most slides because it's cut-and-pasted from the previous slide. I have no idea why the prof feels the need to repeat stuff so much...and then crams so much text/so many diagrams onto a single slide. It can be a pain to wade through.\"",

The professor is adamant about setting the median and made the final extra difficult because we had done well on the midterms, which is frustrating. However, he is a good professor and slides humor into his otherwise-monotone lectures. I would not have wanted to take this class with a different professor, and I highly recommend taking this class with Glueck. As for lab, it was not really relevant to the course content beyond the first few weeks. However, it did teach a lot of laboratory skills that could not be taught over Zoom, which I appreciated. The lab write-ups were just analysis and usually pretty short, and then a scientific communication which was longer but not graded harshly. Even though lab was supposed to be 4 hours, we usually got out within 2-3.\"",

A lot of it is review from AP Chem. The tests are hard, but fair. Glueck expects you to understand the material well enough to apply it to a problem. Be aware that the exam problems are much harder than the homework problems since they require an extra level of understanding. That being said, they give tons of partial credit, so if you only know how to do part of the problem, write that part down and you'll get lots of points for it. Glueck, however, made the class amazing. He's an excellent lecturer--very clear, writes enough on the board so that it's easy to follow, and also gives you a printout of all of the powerpoint slides that he uses. He cracks subtle but hilarious jokes and does enough demos to keep your attention. I rarely found myself not paying attention in his class, which is way more than I can say for all of my other intro math/science classes so far. Go to office hours! I only went once before every exam, but he's very helpful--if you're stuck, he'll explain something in a new way and he gives you hints about what to focus on when you study. Also, he's even funnier during office hours. And if that isn't enough, go to see his furby carved out of wood or his periodic table of fruits/vegetables in his office.\"",
            "review 9: \"09S with David Glueck: First to preface this review, I would like to say that for my first 3 terms I have been PINING for a slow clap for a prof on the last day of class. I just about gave up on ever seeing that, when something absolutely glorious happened: David S. Glueck gets the slow clap on the last lecture on crystal fields that ends 15 minutes early. He is the only prof I know of who has gotten the slow clap from his students. That in itself should be a testament to how great the guy is. The class is difficult largely because his tests are extremely tricky and challenging. But then again, there were people killing the tests. People who had AP Chem or a solid chem. background will have an easier time (as with any Dartmouth science class). Nevertheless, medians hovered around 70% so there was a lot of room for error on these tests. Often, the difference between being above or below the median was 1 tricky question. A word of warning: while his practice tests are good for being sure you understand the foundations of the chemistry, DO NOT depend on them as accurate representations of his exams. His tests are much trickier (with a few gimmie questions) and often require some sort of trick or manipulation of the equation that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really involve so much chemistry as an ability to solve tricky puzzles. The final, for many people (and me), was the kind of test you flip through and realize that you have reached the end of the exam without knowing straight off the bat how to answer any of the questions. Just be prepared to think outside the box for his tests no matter how much you study. The tests are nevertheless fair because he tests on concepts covered in class, with some added twist. If you can get 50% of the test and nail a hard question and get partial credit on everything else, you are golden (the worst thing you can do is freak out and leave things blank on the test b/c he is a generous grader). DO ALL THE HOMEWORK ALSO. Glueck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teaching and personality makes up for the painful tests. His lectures are really helpful and he definitely knows his stuff (no interruptions, seamless lectures, solid flow). He lets it rage. I felt that I learned from the lectures, especially when I took the time to overview the material before class. He keeps it basic so you get the foundations, but you will need to work from there. He is also a funny dude to listen to, and he cracks some solid respectable jokes (awareness of our love for keystone?, social commentary on how students no longer go to farms when describing resonance? ) His standup may rival Prof. Milde. He is a nice guy who cares about his students, is understanding and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always available for office hours (he sets up several before exams). Most importantly, how could you NOT like a prof who wears the following to lecture: sweet Nike air kicks (YES), shorts and baller shirts sometimes with intricate Indian designs (look out for the one with the fish!) on them. In all seriousness, I was worried before going into chem 6 after a less then great experience in Chem 5. It is tough, so you have to work hard and be on top of your stuff, but his test gives a lot of room for mistakes with the curve. The material is also easier then chem. 5. It will push your knowledge and make you think. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that solid A++++++++, but what I LEARNED in class makes up for it and I am still very satisfied with the course and what I ended up getting. Challenging class but Glueck makes it worth it. As rap sensation Lil Wayne stated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the best [chemistry] rapper alive\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

Labs were a giant waste of time: exactly like Chem 5 except at least in Chem 5 you did experiments that *could* be considered useful, whereas in this class there seemed to be zero connection between the lecture content and what we were doing in lab. Additionally, the lab manual is impossible to understand and the TAs make it very clear during lab that they do not want to be there either. Overall, everyone (including the TAs and Cantor) hates this class. Take it if you have to, I guess.\"",

We had 4 problem sets over the term, which were actually much appreciated because they forced me to do practice problems which I probably wouldn't have done otherwise.

He teaches certain concepts ONLY during office hours when students ask deeper questions to him personally and creates exam questions that DOESN'T properly reflect his practice exams.

I started off not liking Zhang very much, but my opinion of him improved significantly throughout the term. This was his first time teaching an undergrad class, so I respect him tackling it head on. I felt like he got better at explaining as the term progressed. Unfortunately, right when I was getting used to his teaching style and right as he was becoming a better teacher, Wilcox took over, and Zhang didn't lecture again until the very end. I expect that he's on an upward trajectory, and he'll be an even better teacher the next time around. Zhang was really kind, his practice exams were really faithful to the real exams, he always welcomed raising a zoom hand and asking for clarifications, and he had lots of concept checks in his lectures. Onto Wilcox, I think he's a much better teacher than Zhang, which is pretty obvious because he's an old dude and really experienced. I also found Wilcox to be very kind. His lectures were sneaky though, he presented the topics very simply, kinda teaching us the basics, and then threw really difficult questions at us for the exams. Wilcox and Zhang were kind of opposites in that respect: Zhang would teach us at the level at which we would be evaluated, but also tended to speed through the basics. Wilcox spent loads of time on the basics and then took off our training wheels only during the actual exams. That part was frustrating. I guess I prefer being taught the kinds of things that show up on the exams, even if it's hard. I had Epps for Chem 5, who is a phenomenal teacher in every respect, so every chem prof is gonna be under her shadow. Ultimately I think I was disappointed in these profs just because I kept comparing them to Epps. But this class is doable, just take some layups alongside of it. The lab was tedious but on the easier side (except the presentation and paper we had to write at the very end, that was a pain in the ass).

Not only did they send out a very generic canvas announcement, but they did not postpone or make the final or the last quiz optional. Which many STEM profs did this term, so doing so would not be out of the ordinary. On the note of mental health, they also regularly told me and my friends that they would pose quizzes with sights of low medians (60s to be exact). This is horrible to say the least seeing that Dartmouth is not reputable for being a pre med school (rather it is known for govt & econ). I did fine, but that does not mean that I will sugar coat the experience. Find friends who know the material, look for resources online like youtube and what not, do not be afraid of study groups with friends -- just be sure to stay on task lol. I used the clearing house, friends, and the TSF, office hours were basically a waste of time. Wilcox will dodge questions like nobody's business, Zhang will tell you good intel but still talks very fast which is harder to track since you can't pause the lecture vid. Zhang is nice, and can be annoying at times but I liked him. Wilcox can screw off, such a jerk. He also taught a concept entirely wrong about the Born Harber cycle where he told us to take \u00bd of the BDE, the TSF\u2019s session also said to take \u00bd of the BDE in his review session, so we all pretty much did on the quiz. Not only were we docked points for taking \u00bd, but we were also docked for our final answer due to the obvious domino effect. Additionally, my friend pointed out that we were lumped in with people who got this question wrong because they did not understand how the cycle worked. The review about him not giving points is so valid. He should have given me about 10 points back but he claimed it was more than 1-2 points (which he made seem like he wouldn't regrade for more than 1-2 points on the entire assessment but nooo he means per question). Good rule of thumb, pass your TA grading doubts through Zhang, he will almost always give you points back. The TSF was nice but not the most hopeful (to be fair he had no part in the unfair grading and did make review material that reinforced content just did not mirror the quizzes as you\u2019d expect). The homework is nothing compared to the difficulty of the quizzes, it is way too easy. If anything, take this class at another institution if these professors teach it again because it will make you doubt your intelligence or just lower your self-esteem. Overall just DO NOT take a class that you'll be the guinea pig and has no medians with that prof -- I\u2019d say this is an amazing rule of thumb for all STEM classes if you can.\"",

I felt like her concepts were basically just her restating word-for-word the EXACT same explanation from the textbook which is not helpful when you're learning something for the first time. As a result, I had ZERO interaction with her because I decided that it was better to learn about concepts from Chemistry LibreTexts and watching videos from The Organic Chemistry Tutor on Youtube. The good thing about this class were that the exams were pretty similar to previous years and they were open book, meaning that you could use your notes, her slides, the textbook, and other CHEM 6 resources. Furthermore, you had 24 hours to do them which was more than enough time to complete them. Obviously this class may be different in the future even if it's still online so just be aware of that. So overall, Mirica is an eh prof - it's clear that she cares about her students and is very organized but she needs to get better at explaining concepts. I think I would've struggled a lot more if I didn't have an AP chem background coming in.\"",
            "review 6: \"19S with Katherine Mirica: okay, listen. in 18S, Mirica's medians were like a little too high for the department's liking so we got DESTROYED. She gave us the test from 18S and a practice test for the first exam and said our exam was going to be ~very similar~ INCORRECT. This class was not too hard for a Dartmouth chem course, but it was just sooooooooo frustrating (I've never seen a chem class more prepared than ours was for our second exam and the median was still low 70s). Like she was testing stuff on things we just did not know and were not given the \"tools\" to answer. Most classes and tests at Dartmouth are like \"you will see things you've never seen before on the test\" THIS IS TRUE, but usually the professors give the students the tools they need to approach and get these questions correct. Also, Mirica does not do a good job at explaining the concepts covered in chem 6--she teaches straight out of the textbook (which was written by a psychist) and over-complicates things. However, with this all said, the class is still curved so a median grade of like 76 would be a \"B.\" And hopefully, the Teaching Science Fellow will be amazing like ours was. tips for succeeding in this class: DO COLLABORATIVE LEARNINGS (she will take like one question from all of them, modify it, and put it on the exam) DO CUMMULATIVE/ADDITIONAL TEXTBOOK PROBLEMS (for our second midterm, she took one of the harder textbook questions and put it in the test) LOOK AT OBJECTIVES (this won't be THAT helpful but it gives you a good idea of what will be tested on) GO TO OFFICE HOURS NEAR THE EXAM (she will give you hints at how she will test a concept and you can clarify if you need to know something for a test and she will most likely tell you)\"",
            "review 7: \"19S with Katherine Mirica: Mirica is terrible at explaining things. The tests were also pretty hard although not impossible. If you don't find some sort of outside help to understand the material, you won't be able to get it based just on what she says.\"",
            "review 8: \"19S with Katherine Mirica: Mirica is fine prof for all the content up until the first midterm. However, GOD HELP YOU when you start quantum mechanics. She\u2019s literally unintelligible. I\u2019m not sure how someone could so poorly explain electrons but she finds a way. She refuses to clearly anything and starts giving examples without ever defining a concept or explaining what she\u2019s doing. The exams are tough, but are made way harder by an unpredictable grading system. There were severals times on the second midterm where students would answer the question correctly, but lose ALL credit because they did not use the same wording as she did. She releases the practice exams to you, so on the second midterm read very carefully what words she\u2019s using for the justification section and make sure those EXACT words appear in your answer. They don\u2019t even have to be right-just use them. Her office hours are sort of helpful if you go in with a very specific question and multiple ways to ask it (otherwise she gives vague answers that do not make sense). She\u2019s a firm believer in \u2018leading you to the answer\u2019 to the point she won\u2019t answer anything at all. The Chemistry department was angry her medians were so high in 2018 so she just decided to make the tests 10x harder and not teach us the material. Our medians were 76%, 73% on midterms. You can do well in this class, you just have to be willing to put in a lot of extra effort to understand the material since she is not going to explain it to you. The textbook is OK, but will require a second read to fully understand. Cling to your teaching science fellow with every fiber of your being and seek out every chemistry resource even if you are great at chemistry. I highly recommend MIT\u2019s opensource classes-they have very clear lectures that will help you understand whatever Mirica\u2019s trying to say. Success in this course is not based on how smart you are, it\u2019s whether or not you can outsmart Mirica. Stay ahead in the reading, do the practice problems, see the teaching science fellow, stay calm and focused on an exam, and do not be afraid to ask for a regrade.\"",
            "review 9: \"19S with Katherine Mirica: I just read two of the reviews from 19S with Mirica and they were, to be honest, very different from my experience in the class. Granted, I did take IB HL Chemistry in high school which definitely helped me, and I don't really like Mirica, but I think the reviews were accurate in terms of Mirica but not in terms of the material. Yes, Mirica does have problems explaining and introducing things clearly - when we started atomic and molecular orbitals, she threw around s, p, d, and f like everyone knew exactly what she was saying. And yes, she's not super helpful in terms of seeking help - my personal grudge is from the second midterm, where she disappeared for 90% of the tests so I couldn't find her to ask questions, reappeared 10 minutes before the end, told me she wasn't taking any more questions, left and came back a minute before the end, and then answered approximately six people's questions. Just not mine, apparently. And also yes, the format and grading of the exams are kind of wack - especially for the first two midterms, the questions on our actual exams were stuff we had literally never seen before and the practice exams didn't help at all. Also, they take off random points for no reason at all (I could go on for way longer about another grudge I hold) and Mirica only accepts regrade requests for losses of 3 points or more. But in terms of the material, I found it manageable. There are a TON of resources outside of Mirica herself - the TSF, the review problems she makes (2 sets a week), the lecture summaries she posts, the collaborative learning problems you do in groups in class, etc. With all of this, I did fine in the class (but please take this with a grain of salt, I know that some people don't come in with the chem background that I did). I think that as long as you reach out to the right resources (and also your fellow classmates), and gives this class the attention it needs (I think I spent 10 hours a week at minimum just reviewing notes/reading the textbook/doing problems), you'll be okay. It's not a layup by any means, but it is possible!!\"",

Midterms were very fair, except she expects really deep conceptual answers to some periodic trend questions, and you never go into creating an explanation like that in class.

That's a terrible contradiction right there! He tells us that he will not follow the other Chemistry professor's exam and will make his own but then a few days before exams, he admits that he used a few (A FEW? more like practically EVERYTHING!) examples from the other professor's exams.

Lab isn't bad: the prof and TAs will help you out so that should boost your grade. You need to write a paper at the end about one of the experiments, which is a time suck, but is not difficult. In terms of lecture, Robustelli gives lots of entertainment in class with some pretty bad jokes, rock references, and weird vendetta against premeds (he just thinks it's weird that people put so much on wanting to be doctors). His lectures are at times difficult to follow but the class is recorded which makes things easier. There are lots of office hours throughout the week, but the prof often gets bogged down in looking for interesting details instead of just answering your question. So, USE THE TSF! Chris Huang was a literal lifesaver in office hours and meetings so PLEASE, if you have a TSF, lean on them! In terms of exams, the first midterm and final were fine, second midterm was a crazy curveball with lots of stuff we had not seen before. According to Robustelli, no one should be able to answer all the questions on an exam and he delivered on that idea on midterm #2! Class has a B+ median, though, so it is certainly possible to do well. Generally, if you want to do well in this class, work VERY hand, meet with the prof and TSF, do ALL the practice problems, and be actively engaged in lecture (Robustelli does these live polls with multiple choice questions in lecture which is a good way to say focused; he also counts your participation in those for an attendance grade). I wouldn't say to actively seek out taking this class with Robustelli (unless you really like chatting about classic rock and quantum mechanics), but I definitely would't say to actively avoid him either. He's pretty good relative to the chem department, and pretty accommodating within reason.\"",

He often spends time writing down the derivations that explain the relationships between equations, which is perhaps conceptually cool information (and of course there's some value in understanding the relationships don't come from nowhere) but it is of no relevance to the assessments and, for me, often obscured what was actually important. He also makes enough mistakes on the board with +/- signs and writing the wrong numbers/terms down that it's worth mentioning as a consistent problem.

Wilcox is a fast writer and will prove that to you when he runs through problems on the board skipping about 4 or 5 steps per problem, leaving you with the attitude of \"Wait, hang on, i just need like 20 seconds to realize how you got to that... he's doing another problem... he... wait... I... what did he just say? ACK!\" And then your head explodes. The other odd thing was the fact that none of the homeworks were required or graded. The only grades in the course were labs (a very small portion) and 2 midterms and a final (a very large portion). You had to force yourself to do the practice problem sets, because you had no other reason to do them. As with the typical freshman intro course, the first test grades were fairly low and gave me, personally, hope. Unfortunately, the freshmen, never having gotten such low grades in their lives before, ramped it up for the next two tests, and basically put me in my place. Dean Wilcox (Not really a dean, mind you) has this nasty habit on tests, however. The problem sets and practice tests he gives out are doable with practice, so you go into tests confident. Then he throws curves, knuckles, sinkers, and eventually, beanballs at you by seemingly leaving out random information you previously had and testing on concepts never even alluded to in any practice problem. On one test, the entire class lost 25-50% of the points on a problem for not knowing that 1 atm remains in a gas tank when empty.

In lecture, she has to move extremely quickly, but the course is very well organised and explained - Epps makes sure you should always understand what's going on. I have two major pieces of advice for aspiring chemists: firstly, as everyone says: DO ALL THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. Though there are literally hundreds, doing them will give you a great insight into how the exams will function, and the questions are very formulaic. Secondly, I would recommend rewatching all the lecture recordings - this was the biggest help for me, as you can slow them down to better understand the material which she has a tendency to zip through during class time. The course is very tough, no question, but Epps knows what she's doing, and with enough work, Chem 5 is solvable.\"",
            "review 9: \"22W with Wendy Epps: Lots of mixed thoughts. This class challenged me a lot, and as someone who does not find chemistry particularly interesting, it made for an uphill battle. Epps is a wonderful person, but I didn't love her as a teacher. In order to get through so much content in 10 weeks, she had to move through everything super quickly, but I felt like I never understood anything she explained. My understanding came almost entirely through doing practice problems. Ultimately, she does care about us and that is evidently clear, but I wish she taught in a way that gave us more time to process materiel. Felt like a lot was bulldozed through. If you put in a lot of time, go to office hours, and try and ask questions when you can, odds are you will be fine.\"",
            "review 10: \"22W with Wendy Epps: As the other reviews have mentioned, previous chem 5 reviews were definitely overdramatic. This class will not test your will to live. Yes, it is difficult but not impossible to succeed in. Epps and Maryam provide everything you need to pass this class. We had 3 exams and 2 problem sets. For the problem sets, we were allowed to work with other people and ask Epps and Maryam for help. My advice for approaching the exams is do as many additional problems and Maryam's problems as you can. Obviously do the practice exams too. For exam 1 the practice exam mirrored it greatly. The additional problems exposes you to the type of problems you'll see on the test. One thing I wished I realized earlier is that this class is a thinking class. You can't only know how to do the problems, you have to also have to understand the chemistry thats taking place. Don't let this scare you, I'm talking about a basic understanding of what's happening. This why I think Epps's setup is really helpful. In lecture she explains the chemistry really thoroughly and if you want clarification Epps and Maryam are available (and so helpful) during office hours. The additional problems gives you the needed practice with the math and Chemistry. Another part of chem 5 is the lab component. Yes its annoying but again just something you have to deal with it.\"",

Yes, its a lot of material, and the lectures are pretty fast-paced, but Epps is an amazing lecturer - she is super organized and lays out every unit before we start, makes sure to answer every question even in a big lecture-based class, and provides a TON of additional practice problems. The biggest thing I would say to do is do every single problem that Epps and the teaching fellow give out because if you do them all you will basically know what you're going to see on the test and will probably understand the material pretty well. If you don't understand the material, Epps is super available and really good at explaining problems. The tests were also curved pretty generously and the test problems were all based on the practice questions without giving many big twists, so as long as you knew the problems you'd be ready for the content on the exams. Just make sure you pay attention in class, take good notes, and do all of the practice problems. If you get behind, it'll be hard to catch up but if you stay on top of your work it's pretty manageable!\"",

She has ample office hours, and if you email her, she is relatively prompt to respond to your question. Additionally, I thought the amount of course assigned was very manageable, and the exams were a reasonable level of difficulty. Before every exam I stressed about whether or not I had studied enough (I studied significantly less than all my friends), but as long as you understand the content and why you solve a problem the way you do, it was honestly not bad at all.

I'll let other people attack that part of the class. How to get an A: do every single practice problem you're given. The prof uploads some, then she uploads additional ones, then the TSF will upload a ton. Do them all. Do them all again. Do them all until you can remember the steps. The exams are definitely tough, as others have said, but she will reuse problems from the 'additional upload' ones (but changes numbers around). So, if you've done all the additional problems, you'll already know like 30% of the exam -- which is super great considering that these exams are a grind to complete in 3.5 hours. Prof. Epps is a wonderful person, she just has the impossible task of teaching so much material is 10 weeks. I applaud her for being such a great professor.

Our TSF Nick was the greatest human ever and seriously changed this class for me, he had problem solving sessions twice a week and was available for one on one meetings which was incredible. The content is super math heavy so be prepared for the fact that you don't really learn any facts just calculations. There were two 3.5 hour midterms and a 4.5 hour final which were all mentally and physically draining but if you do ALL of the practice problems from Epps and the TSF you'll be fine. The lab is worth 17% of your grade.

The material is easy to work through and understand as long as you invest the time and effort, but it's just something about the exams that tripped me up (not to say they weren't fair; they definitely were). A word of advice: If you are someone who considers yourself to have an already solid background in chemistry and think this course will be relatively simple, I suggest you proceed with caution (especially when it comes to the second half of the course).

            "review 35: \"20F with Wendy Epps: The Class: This class was entirely virtual this term, and personally I thought the format of the class was still very conducive for learning. We only met twice a week, once in a scheduled period and another time during our X-hour, and between each synchronous session, we would watch anywhere from 2-5 lecture videos which ranged from 15-60 minutes each. In class, we worked on problems from the lecture concepts. The class problems were similar to the level of difficulty on the tests so I found it helpful to have a really solid understanding of how to solve the class problems. The Work: This class is doable, but it is a lot of work if you want to do well. Every 3 days, we were introduced to a new concept, type of problem, or set of equations that we had to have down by the next class session. In class, we never reviewed old material but I found the TSF review and problem solving sessions to be super helpful. It is imperative to do EVERY problem given. Epps doesn't assign pointless problems. I thought that it was most important to understand additional practice problems though, so when I was short on time, I would prioritize those. I didn't take AP Chem before this class, so I had a lot of material to cover, and I took as many opportunities as I could (office hours, review sessions, study groups, etc) and I was able to get an A, so don't let a weak background in chemistry scare you away from this course. The Tests: Grades for this class were predominantly from 2 midterms and one final. Tests were hard, but if you understand WHY things work and can think critically, all of the problems are certainly doable. Medians were typically in the low to mid 70s. The class is curved to a B- or B average though. The Prof: Prof Epps is AMAZING. She explains concepts clearly, efficiently, and prioritizes critical thinking to apply concepts and problem solving techniques to a wide range of material. If you don't understand something, she can always explain it in another way that makes sense, and makes herself available for office hours to answer any question, no matter how dumb it may seem. The TSF, Nick, was also super helpful in this course. Attending review sessions would be my number one tip for success, it's the only chance to see what you know in a way that isn't graded.

The mean scores were 70, 50 and 60, but that is good! That means you don't have to do everything perfectly to do well. In fact, if there is a whole problem or two that you can't do, you are still fine. In the other chem class the medians were as high as 84, which meant that you had to know everything perfectly and stick the landing. I had friends in the other class who made copy errors that may end up making the difference in their grades, and that is not right. Another note on tests, they are all about problem solving, you wont see any definition problems or anything like that, so come to them focused.

He will then ask the class what we think, but we have no idea because he has taught nothing. Then, he will make a terrible joke to cover up his lack of teaching ability and move on.

The lack of experience showed in his teaching style. He rushed through a great deal of material; his lectures were often disorganized; and he switched back and forth between using Powerpoint and writing notes on the blackboard because he was uncertain about which was more effective (he needed instruction about how to use both).

Without that, I would have withdrawn the course, feeling hopeless. If you have taken AP Chem and understand basic chemistry, it is fairly easy, but with little chemistry background (besides basic sophomore h.s. chem), I felt completely lost in the class. Not to say Anderson is a difficult teacher--that's giving her too much credit. She's just plain incompetent. Students continually interrupted her in class to correct her mistakes, so I never really knew if my notes were actually correct until I checked later in the textbook. Here is the basic layout of Anderson's class: she uses example after example, straight out of the book, to 'illustrate' a concept she's trying to teach. Then, assuming she doesn't mess up in deriving some formula or with changing signs, she moves on to the next concept, again taking examples straight out of the book. She also starts out immediately with dimensional analysis, which she didn't explain and which I always hated using to figure out units. It's not that hard just to multiply it out. But, if you're stuck in the class with no way out, and you don't want to drop the class (because really, it isn't fun dropping a prereq for a major), I would definitely recommend 1) study groups with friends, 2)using the study guide, textbook, and cd for practice, and 3) going to another chem section instead of her lectures.

As soon as it came to stuff I didn't know, I didn't really like his approach to the subject. I was always decently good at chem throughout high school and liked to understand the chemistry in a way that i could solve problems, rather than Stolzberg's formulaic approach to solving acid-base chem and entropy. Instead of understanding the subject, I felt like he would have rather us just understand his \"algorithm\" for solving a problem and then tweak it a bit to use in exam questions. I lost all my interest in this course after a few weeks (when I managed to skip a class or two) and soon found I was lost and never able to catch up. This course moves really fast, and I recommend you attend every class if you want to keep up. It's also not curved so do as well as you can in exams, it doesn't matter if other people drop out (which they will, 30% of the other section did) as the curve won't shift. OWL questions (online questions) are mandatory, and I felt they were a good way to learn the material even if you did just look at the answers and work backwards. Make sure to plan out the work though, as some OWL homeworks can be much longer than others and I sometimes found myself scrambling to finish as much as I could before the 11:59pm deadline. I would say his exams are fair, almost every question is answerable though there might be one curveball that might throw people off out of the 9-10 questions he has on each exam. If you want to do well in this class, keep up with reading ( i found the textbook really useful) and do OWL. There are three midterms and an exam, which I found to be quite a handful especially toward the end of term.

Very knowledgeable guy who genuinely cares about teaching, I've heard this is one of his favorite classes to teach and it shows. Basically no homework - some pre-class lectures that I sometimes watched, but to be honest, this class is pretty easy if you paid attention in high school chemistry (I didn't take AP). Textbook is kind of useless, probably don't need to buy it (if you need access to practice problems, torrent the textbook). Overall, wonderful class, would recommend. However: lab is TERRIBLE. Anita Prasad is a bumbling fool who thinks you're a ninety-year-old blindfolded monkey about to fool around with hydrochloric acid. We had just finished learning about diprotic weak acids in lecture, and in pre-lab lecture she spent half an hour explaining what an acid is. She can and will waste your time. Also the lab manual is atrocious don't even try reading the \"general info\" stuff. Tried to get my friend in honors orgo to explain it to me and he didn't even understand the manual. It took everything in my power not to break this little woman, if she can be called that. I am filled with rage.\"",
            "review 9: \"19W with Michael Ragusa: This class was challenging for me. I had a weak background in chemistry (just regular chemistry early on in high school) and I did not find the flipped classroom setting to be very helpful. For me, just practicing questions in class made the material hard to apply to the test and to retain for long durations of time. I did all the textbook questions and the practice questions/tests; even with all this work, there was still a conceptual rift between me and the content. The labs were tedious but they usually helped me understand things more because you could see all of the steps involved. Ragusa is a nice man who is clearly passionate about the material, but his lectures were overall on the boring side. Tests were hard and the medians were ~very~ low for the second one.\"",
            "review 10: \"16F with Michael Ragusa: This class takes a lot of flack, but it's honestly high school chem 2.0. That doesn't mean it's easy, but a lot of the material you've likely learned already, and if you were fine then you'll be fine now. Ragusa's lectures followed the book pretty exactly which made review/prep pretty straight-forward. Workload is 2 midterms and 3 problem sets assigned on random weeks.\""

            "review 1: \"20W with Ekaterina Pletneva: This class was taught by both Professor Lipson (first five weeks of the term) and Professor Pletneva (latter 5 weeks) and jointly graded. To be brief, the class was exactly what you may expect out of a premed prerequisite. Pretty bullshitty, not that rewarding, but you have to take it once, and you'll never think about it after. With that said, I would say this experience was more true under Lipson, than under Pletneva. Pletneva's lectures genuinely made me want to learn, and investigate chemistry, whereas Lipson's lectures made me not want to come to class. I think Pletneva is a superior teacher, but it could also just be that the material in the first 5 weeks of class were not as interesting as the material in the latter 5 weeks. I really enjoyed the class under Pletneva.\"",
            "review 2: \"09F with Ekaterina Pletneva: The teacher is very nice, and will help you at office hours, but did not give good lectures. She made me more confused half the time when she gave lectures, because she would leave out stuff, and do problems in strange ways. She also really likes to derive equations during lectures which taught me nothing and just made me more confused. Really a self-taught course. Do not take unless you have to. It was a lot of work, and not fun at all.\"",

She is extremely well-organized and responsive to students' needs, so if you put in some effort and meet her halfway, you'll do fine--and maybe even realize that you enjoyed it. The web-work (OWL) could be quite tedious at times, but it helped cement concepts as well as provided (basically) free points to boost your grade.\"",
            "review 6: \"09F with Ekaterina Pletneva: Although I had not taken any chemistry prior to Chem 5, I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Professor Pletneva is excellent. She was extremely clear during class, in which she derived everything and explained the ideas and formulae extremely well. It went so well that I wasn't aware that Chem 5 was supposed to be all that bad until I was well into the term. You should definitely do all the written homework, and more if possible. A lot of your success in depends on your practice and the time you put into this class. The only bad part about this class was the O.W.L. web assignments. They were most tedious and for what they were worth, I would much rather have had written homework. All the same, I really enjoyed the class and give Professor Pletneva my highest recommendation. As for Chem 5, I can see how a bad prof might make this a bad experience. However, the material is not that bad, especially if you can devote a decent amount of time to practice problems so you can really wrap your mind around concepts (a couple of hours a week should do the trick, maybe less if you do the problems as you go along in class.)\"",

The class was fast-paced and every exam was a slap in the face. However, since most topics were new, I learned a lot and never felt as though I was wasting time by going to lecture. Please, please keep up with the hw problems -- at about 10-20 min each (towards the end), it sucks to do 80 of them the night before the exam (they did provide good prep, though). Prof. Pletneva is VERY willing to help and will pretty much meet with you one-on-one anytime. I wish I'd gone to her with my questions earlier. She's great in office hours, very efficient and to-the-point in answering questions. Also, if you're really struggling with a concept, she'll try to present it in different ways until it clicks.\""

(why use the x hours if you don't use the full hour of any of the classes? only FAP could answer that one for you). and then there were the tests... has anyone ever written four worse tests consecutively? figuring out what he was asking was MORE than half the battle. on the whole, way too many people had to drop this class because of failing. (even more than is typical for chem 5). professor palocsay was a nice man, but a bad teacher and certianly not one i or anyone would expect or be pleased with at Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 2: \"03W with Frank A.: Possibly the worst Professor I've ever had or could imagine. Terrible lecturer. Worked few to no problems in class. Complained about the weather and George Bush instead of actually teaching chemistry. I'm probably dumber for having taken the class. Big Frank's exams were totally B.S. Don't get me wrong--I got an A in the course without having taken AP Chem, but I felt like this guy was an idiot, and that his tests had nothing to do with anything. The Chemistry Department was just stupid for hiring a visiting professor from JMU to teach the course. Get Professor Milde, Anderson, or Lipson. Hopefully this guy will never make it back to Hanover.\"",

I learned nothing from him, and quit going to class halfway through was on of my better decisions freshman year. His tests were tricky in stupid, irrelevant matters and had no relation to what was taught in lectures (thus the reason I stopped going).\"",
            "review 4: \"03W with Frank A.: Frank was not a wonderful prof...but he wasn't as bad as people make out. You had to read the book in this course, because there was some stuff that he did not bother to teach because he thought it would be a waste of time. The guy's exams weren't too much fun, mostly because he thought of very obtuse and concept-driven problems. In other words, if you are someone who just memorizes the formula and doesn't understand why it works, never take a class with this guy. Of course, considering Frank was a visiting prof, you don't have to worry about that.\""

If you took a solid chemistry class in high school than you probably don't need to take this course. But I am really glad I did. If you've never taken Chemistry before Milde goes over the basics and will MAKE you learn it. She really wanted every single person to succeed in the class and she'll take the time to talk to you in or out of class. The tests are incredibly fair and if you understand the problems she does in class you'll be fine. The tests are no harder than homework problems. Overall I'd definitely take this class again.\""
