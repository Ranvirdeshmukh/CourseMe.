The median this term was a B+ and that grade was pulled from a total of 5 assignments and participation. Prof Reinhart is an extremely unforgiving prof and will glare at you and stop class if you're literally 10 seconds late to class. He takes attendance 5 minutes or more before class starts. In terms of the workload its very reasonable- daily readings, 3 responses picked from 6 prompts, a midterm and a final (written). The first 7 weeks of the class are pretty dull. His powerpoints are abysmal for taking notes so you have to be tuned in at all times. He's a harsh grader, and will return assignments to you if they dont have the correct formatting. I was not very invested in this class and didn't do very well because of it. only take this class if you want to put a lot of time into the midterm and final, like the content, and if you can suck up to a prof.\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with A. Kevin Reinhart: Copied from the posting on REL 16.04 The other two reviewers talked about the personality of AKR, and I would agree. He knows the subject and can relay information quite well. There were points where he aired frustration because the class was not engaging in conversation, and he did call out BS answers. What bothered me was requiring students to arrive early, yet class regularly ran over time, showing that he values his time more than the students' time. AKR is a strict grader, and you will learn to write better. BUT, due to his inability to stay organized, the first feedback we received on a graded assignment was in week 7ish. This was after we submitted all three short papers, meaning the only thing we could apply feedback to was the final paper. If a professor wants strict writing standards, that is OK, but only if the students get feedback early so they can apply it. The material is good, and the classes were engaging. The course will give you a better understanding of Islam and the War on Terror and improve your writing abilities. I enjoyed the class, but some peculiarities of the prof would make it hard for me to recommend it.\""

I seriously cant put into words how much I loved this class. The material is incredibly interesting and the professors are so, so qualified to teach it - both of them are leaders in their fields and do incredibly important work. Make no mistake, this isn't really a political/partisan class - the Israel/Palestine conflict, while mentioned, is not the focus. Its more so about identity, and how the idea of \"modernness\" gets looped into how people view themselves and the world (the idea of \"the Arab\" and \"the Jew\"). Think literature, film, short stories, social life, etc. It was absolutely fascinating for me. In terms of difficulty, the class really isn't hard, even though the class manages to teach you SO MUCH and challenge how you view the world. Its one of those rare classes which is a layup and yet teaches you and leaves an impact (I think this class is going to stick with me for a very, very long time). There's weekly discussion posts (150-250 words, mostly just assessed for completion), a short midterm (2 short answer questions about the readings, take-home. Total 1000 words), and a final paper (2000 words on anything loosely related to the topics of the class). None of these are graded super stringently, yet I found them very helpful in improving my understanding of the course material. Oh, not to mention that the professors are friends and joke around with each other in class! I cannot recommend this class enough - a MUST TAKE, even if you're not super into MES/JWST\""

He literally was in Cairo for Arab Spring -- the man is brilliant and funny and captivating to listen to. This is without a doubt the most I have learned in a Dartmouth class. The structure goes like this: two movies assigned per week plus some readings (and a discussion post). A couple students lead a discussion based on those materials and the whole class engages. Sounds simple yet it's quite effective. Beyond that, it's just a final! Not too shabby at all! You can write a 18 page paper, make a podcast + a 4 page paper, or do an art piece with an 8 page paper for that final. The last day of class, he brought us pizza and gave a little speech about how important this class was to him. I legitimately teared up. He is one of those professors that is intimidating, not because he is scary or intense, simply because you crave his approval. He is so eloquent and kind and just exactly what a professor should be.

I took this course simply out of interest. There was a decent amount of reading (sometimes over 100 pages) that was normally front loaded and due on Monday or Wednesday (with oftentimes nothing due on Fridays). So, if you space out the reading it isn't too bad. We had two major assignments - a 2500ish word midterm paper and a 1500ish word final paper. If you gather together enough quotes and assemble a coherent argument you should do fine. Professor Nikpour also devotes a LOT of her time to helping students in 1 on 1 meetings before the due date, so if you have any questions definitely take advantage of that. Classes are mostly lectures, but there are lots of opportunities to ask questions if you have any. The class was not a layup per se (especially for me, a STEM person), but it was a pretty consistent workload of mostly reading (and a few occasional discussion posts). If you prepare/outline the two papers ahead of time, and meet with the professor you will do fine.

It is a little hard on grading since your entire grade is dependent on 3 papers and you don't get to revise or anything (I've heard that it is different for other writing courses), but that also means that you have less overall work since you only turn in things three times the entire term. The course is heavily Jewish-focused since Glinert is Jewish and studies Hebrew/Judaism studies, but there is still an adequate amount of Christian and Islamic thought thrown in. All readings (there are a lot!!) are put online, which is also nice. I loved this class but also think that one would fare better if you already had a strong interest/it was your first choice.

I don't mean to be so mean since this class was her first time teaching and she was in a new city while still being a PhD student, but I think half the people in the class could have taught it infinitely better than her. For a TMV, this class does not inspire any of the curiosity or interest that it should unless you really reach for it. It's much more of a history class than a religion class, and the dullest parts of Islamic history at that. Prof Silkaitis repeatedly used the excuse that it was the standard syllabus that she was given by the MES department, but I know for a fact this isn't true; friends who have taken the course with other professors say that they integrate more interesting, relevant, and student-driven information to the class than whatever was used for this one. There's a lot of class discussion (which accounts for 20% of your grade), but they're all really dull, so it's hard to participate (coming from someone who participated a decent amount). The midterm was easy enough \u2013 pick 10 terms out of 20 and define them in 2-3 sentences. However, the terms she selected are reflective of the fact that this class is useless to an understanding of modern-day Islam. There are weekly response papers that are supposed to be 1.5 pages but by the end of the term needed to be 2 for an A lol. They were also graded really arbitrarily \u2013 you could write something great and concise and get a B or write something longer that's incoherent, incorrect bullshit and get an A. The final exam was picking 2 out of 3 essay prompts to respond to. The essays were promised to be a little longer than a response paper \u2013 in actuality, they had to be around 5 pages. TLDR \u2013 unstable, weird, dull prof; bad content (for the most part); weird assignments; too much work to juggle all of this.\"",

I needed a TMV requirement, so I hopped in this class hoping it wouldn't be too bad. It turned out to be easily the worst class I've ever taken at Dartmouth. I worked really hard in this class. I basically had to learn Islam from the ground level (I have no religious background), I participated in 90% of class days, and I went to office hours on multiple occasions. For an intro course like this, just showing that kind of engagement for a subject you know nothing about should get you an A, but the grades seem subjective and nobody really has a clue. It really starts with Prof Silkaitis. It was her first time ever teaching a class. She is a Princeton PhD student and was WAY over her skis. Sometimes, I was worried about her overall sanity because she didn't seem all that stable mentally. I feel for her and hope she gets help she needs because it was clear that things were not always alright. It was clear as soon as you entered the room what kind of mood she was in. If she was having a bad day, it was going to be a brutal 65 minutes of class. Beyond the teacher's mental health, the class was simply unpredictable. I remember the first day we had a pop quiz on the readings that were assigned the night before and people were freaking out because that wasn't written on the syllabus. The majority of the class is participation based, and it accounts for about 25% of your grade. This makes it extremely awkward since Prof Silkaitis isn't a good conductor to steer the class to a successful discussion. This makes it extremely difficult if you don't have a background in Islam. If you don't have a background in Islam, it's hard to do the readings because you don't know any of the characters, and you won't learn the characters until you go to lecture the next day. The class is completely backwards: lectures should tell you who the people are, then you should read, then you should be quizzed. But this class is too unorganized for that to make any sense. The midterm was 20 free response questions but only answer 10 of them (yes, weird format). It ended up being an insanely difficult midterm, and Prof Silkaitis had to grade it super easily so everyone didn't fail. Every week you have a reading response paper that's about 1.5 pages. Throughout the term, she pretty much changed that to 2+ pages if you want an A. Another fun curveball nobody saw coming. The final was pick 2 out of the 3 questions to answer and write a total of 10 pages on those two prompts.\"",

The professor doesn't spend enough time discussing the basics (which would be really important to people with no background and even in general tbh) and also uses some stereotypes that aren't great at all. She is a nice woman for sure, but this is her first time teaching so be wary!!! Her grading scheme is purely on vibes (she takes off points for incorrect italics and tiny things like that). She also expects full-on analytical essays EVERY SINGLE WEEK. I only stayed in the class because I needed an MES major/minor distrib. Otherwise, would've probably dropped. Getting an A- is achievable but with a TON of work and effort.\""

In fact, neither teacher lists office hours on their syllabi! Didn't know they were allowed to do that. Chad Elias, on the other hand, should not be employed by Dartmouth College. He has been inappropriate towards several students, both academically and personally. I went to him before the final with several paper ideas (after weeks of trying to track him down for office hours), and he tore each topic apart because of very minute problems. Since we had to get our topics approved by one teacher and Vandewalle was absent, he refused to approve my topic unless it was something he suggested (all of which were boring topics). This week on for about four days up until the final was due, in which I gave up trying to appease him. Towards the end of the term when I reached out with questions he just stopped replying or did not reply in a timely manner when it was time sensitive. He ultimately said he was incredibly disappointed that I had hobbled together a topic, and that I should be ashamed of my work. After getting the high on the midterm (which was an actual timed test), I was given the low on the final. What's worse is that this was all going on at a time when someone close to me had been in an accident and nearly died, to which Elias did not seem to care. He never once referred me to the dean (which I did not know handled those matters), until final grades were in and he emailed me saying that would have been a much better way to handle it.

To be fair, this class apparently was easy in prior terms, but it seems that the college has cracked down. There are two things that make this class a nightmare. First, there are now four 3-4 page response papers (10% each) that you have to do, which weren't present in prior terms of this course. The mere presence of that work is annoying, but what really makes it shit is the second problem: Kadhim no longer grades any of the work himself. He has outsourced the work to bitchy grad school TAs (yeah go fuck yourself AC '21) who love nothing more but to arbitrarily take off points whenever they can. As such, you essentially have to write full-fledged literary analyses of the books, which in turn, requires you to actually read the books in critical detail. Kadhim himself is also the most boring lecturer I've ever had---his slow, slurred speech makes you want to fall asleep. His lectures are essentially just plot summary of the books, which doesn't give you deep enough details to write the literary analyses the TAs want. And, if you try to contribute to the class, he will often make fun of you for not \"speaking loud enough\" (I think Kadhim has hearing problems? Well, that should be his problem, not the students'.) Oh, and attendance is mandatory and 20% of your grade, so you have to come to class. The final 15 page paper (40%) is the most excruciating paper I've ever written. The only positive things I'll say about this course is that there are no exams (which, to be fair, certainly matters to some people) and that you can 'skip' one of the books (there are 5 books---Kanafani's Men in the Sun, Khedairi's A Sky So Close, Mahfouz's Midaq Alley, Mahfouz's The Thief and the Dogs, Salih's Season of Migration to the North---but only 4 required response papers.)

Our midterm was pretty straightforward, identifying 2 major people/topics we had discussed and then answering 3 short answer questions.

Reading was occasionally worth reading and optional if you could avoid the voracious cold-calling and interrogation tactics of Reinhart (kinda scary). Simon was much more chill. Had uber easy map quiz on the second class, and a short-answer+essay midterm (approx 2400words total) mainly on reading/lecture content, and a film review (12-1500words), and a final project(3-3600words). Profs did not know how to use canvas, and Reinhart graded super harshly whereas Simon graded super easy for the midterm...kinda unfair -- still have no idea how overall grades are gonna turn out.

SMH\"",
            "review 5: \"23W with Kevin Reinhart And Andrew Simon: The content of the class if definitely interesting. I truly feel like I learned a lot and understood the Middle East more. The workload is not bad at all. There is a map quiz on the second day of class (5% of our grade), a midterm that consists of 1 essay and some short answer questions (25%), a 4-5 page film review (20%), and a 3000-3600 word final paper (35%). The downside of the final paper was the fact that it was so long and we weren\u2019t given a prompt. The other 15% is for participation. The professors weren\u2019t horrible, they just aren\u2019t very engaging. They seemed to take themselves way too seriously. They also never provided rubrics which made it hard to decipher what they were looking for in the assignments. Professor Simon is a very easy grader which helped with the midterm, film review, and final paper grades. There are around 3-5 readings to do before each class that helped with discussion during class. I would say that you don\u2019t really have to do them. There was occasional cold calling so it would help to skim. While I wouldn\u2019t call it a complete layup, It\u2019s pretty easy to get an A in this class.

Even when I did the readings I still couldn't answer his questions because they were extremely vague. He would also get mad if you did not say exactly what he was thinking. When people don't raise their hands he cold calls. I was genuinely scared to go to class every day. Simon was better and the class was not a lot of work overall, but I still would never recommend it to anyone, at least not while Reinhart is teaching it.\"",

            "review 8: \"23W with Kevin Reinhart And Andrew Simon: Do not take this class with Reinhart. He was simply unprofessional, and downright using intimidation tactics in class. There were several classes where not only did he cold-call everyone to answer his silly questions about the readings, but he would walk right up to a student, stand directly above them in their chair, faces literally 2 feet apart, and be interrogating them about the reading; or worse, whether they even did the reading. The majority of the class clearly did not do the readings, but the way to address that is not by beating a dead horse with scare tactics and intimidation. That's just cruelty and harassment. This was simply not okay and I am not proud to have been a part of this classroom environment. I surely hope I never have a repeat of this experience at Dartmouth.\"",

The class is a lot of reading that you have to do to be able to participate in class discussions (20% of the final grade is participation) but you learn so much.

His class consists of weekly canvas discussions, an essay midterm, essay final, and LOTS of reading so it's not that bad. He doesn't grade too harshly but I would say that it's not easy because it's hard to be engaged in the discussion which promotes intense critical thinking and in-depth knowledge of the readings (so if you can't cram 80 pages you're screwed). It's stress-inducing for a lot of students but he's a really knowledgeable professor who really, REALLY knows his stuff and can pull facts out of thin air. He's amazing and I definitely recommend taking at least ONE class with him. It's intimidating and hard but so worth it because he's a really great professor and intellectual. He's a genius!\"",

Professor Fishere is extremely knowledgeable and pushes students to defend their positions during discussions. He draws a lot from personal experience, especially when discussing the Arab Spring, which makes the class so much more interesting. The midterm and final are short essays that you complete at home. Because Prof Fishere is a novelist, he can be a bit strict on the grading for these assignments. However, I felt that this made me a better writer overall.\""

Also, there's a fair amount of analyzing humor in the class, which is the death of all humor. No, seriously, there's some quote in the class about how the study of humor leads to the absence of humor and at times I thought the class was perpetuating that paradox.
