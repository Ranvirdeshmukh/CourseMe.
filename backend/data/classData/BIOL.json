            "review 1: \"22F with Robert Hill: This culminating course was one of the best classes I have taken at Dartmouth and certainly the best biology course I have taken. Professor Hill is incredibly knowledgeable about the field and provides a very laid-back discussion environment. As a 10A seminar, the small class met twice a week to discuss a recent paper in the field. While the papers are long, dense and require strong knowledge of biochemical and behavioral laboratory procedures, Professor Hill is super understanding, and many topics are clarified during the class discussion. Your grade is determined by summaries of each paper to ensure you actually do the reading (these are completion grades), a final 1500 word research proposal that explores a topic related to the material that interests you and a large presentation. Each person is assigned one of the papers to present by leading the class discussion for one day. A 1-2hr presentation seems daunting, especially regarding a dense bio paper, but between the chill environment and other people participating, it wasn't too bad. Hill doesn't except you to know everything about your paper and office hours can be used to clear anything up. The papers were all super interesting and explored different aspects of neurobiology, cell types and disease pathology.\""

The material taught is very interesting and I felt like I learned a lot through Bezanilla's teaching. She connects individually with each student in the class and makes sure that everyone feels supported. Our TSF, Frankie, was EXTREMELY helpful and offered many resources for students to really grasp the concepts explained during the lectures and then apply the material with practice problems. Definitely take advantage of the numerous review sessions and office hours offered for the course. You'll meet some amazing people in this class as well - I met some of my best friends and they are one of the many reasons why I loved this class so much. However, the workload is very heavy. There are pre-lecture videos that you will need to watch prior to class and there is a lot of lab work that can contribute to many hours per week dedicated to this course. The exams are very difficult.

Coming in freshman fall, the adjustment to college life is enough for anyone to handle. Couple this with a few moderate classes and this is a difficult term. The labs are tedious and come to be a lot of work, and there is an immense amount of out-of-class work that is vital for your success in this class. The midterms are hard. That being said, Bezanilla is awesome, and genuinely cares about each of her students. In addition, the people that took this class were awesome, and came to be some of my closest friends at the end of the term. Totally worth it if you're genuinely interested in biology, and you'll learn a lot. Also, make sure you have a TSF, as Frankie (our TSF) was THE MAN and literally is the only reason why I passed the class.\"",

This was my first biology I've taken here and it was also my first term at Dartmouth, and I thought this was a great but also challenging introduction to the Biology department. The class is definitely fast paced but also manageable because of all the resources offered - prof is amazing, TA's Casey and Sarah were awesome, and the TSF Frankie was phenomenal. Would not have been able to pass this class without Frankie - twice a week review sessions with many practice problems and the availability for 1-on-1 sessions and always just a quick clarification was essential. There were also frequent pre-lecture recordings once or twice a week that had to be watched and then a quick quiz would be taken after before the next lecture started. The class is labeled honors because it goes into rigorous detail about many topics - BIOL 12 is essentially the same class with respect to material. Around 60% of the grades are divided into 3 midterms, and the rest is mainly lab assignments with minor weight give to participation and quizzes. This class is definitely hard, but very much pays off.\"",
            "review 4: \"22F with Magdalena Bezanilla: I loved this class! If you have a genuine interest in molecular biology and are willing to put in the hours, BIOL19 is definitely worth it. Especially for freshmen entering in the fall, the smaller class size is a lot more conducive to learning than the large section format of BIOL12. Take advantage of your amazing peers, space out the pre-lecture and lab preparation, and make use of both the TA's and TSF (Frankie was amazing! changes every year though) Especially for potential pre-meds, classes like this will help cement if you're up for the rigor of a medical education, and it genuinely will help you see how supportive and cool Dartmouth sciences can be right off the bat. Definitely take if you're on the fence!\"",

This is a great way to start Dartmouth STEM courses i.e. a smaller class size with a great professor, dedicated TA/TSFs, and tons of resources. This class did have a good amount of course work, but nothing feels boring or unnecessary. If you plan out your time well, it is totally manageable. I highly recommend this class and encourage those who take it to take full advantage of the office hours and TSF sessions offered.\"",
            "review 6: \"21F with Magdalena Bezanilla: I am a biology major and also pre med, and while I liked some aspects of the course, I also think that you should know what you're getting yourself into for your first term at Dartmouth. This course teaches you a huge amount of material in only 10 weeks, meaning that every day is an hour of lecturing and there are usually videos to watch before class. The material was interesting to me, as I like biology, but it was still a lot of material to review when exams came (which is, admittedly, true of most Dartmouth STEM classes). If you are considering this course just because it's labelled \"Honors,\" or because you were accepted after the placement exam, don't take it -- you need to truly want to learn about cell and molecular biology, and a good background in the topic helps. I had only my high school's \"honors\" biology, and most of the material was new for me. Prof. Bezanilla is super nice and understanding, but her grading style was a bit nerve wracking: she grades \"holistically\" at the end of the term, meaning that even though I knew I got A's on all the lab work and on or above median on the exams (medians were around a 70), I didn't know what grade I'd end with (a B+) until grades were released in December. A few of my friends in the class were really stressed out because of this class and the grading, since they didn't do well on the midterms and weren't sure if they would pass given the unknown curve. You do meet some amazing students in this class with similar interests, and the TA's are really nice (the TSF is a great resource). For a lot of students, this was a great class and the highlight of their term; just be sure that you think about what type of freshman fall you're looking for, and how prepared you are for Dartmouth biology.\"",
            "review 7: \"21F with Magdalena Bezanilla: I absolutely loved this class. I do not have a higher review of professor Bezanilla. She is kind, compassionate, incredibly intelligent and an amazing teacher. Additionally, the teaching fellow Miranda is a god send! This class is hard as fuck so i don't recommend taking it unless you are absolutely sure of your biology abilities because the work can be daunting. I came into the class feeling very confident in my biology abilities and let me tell you this class demanded that I step up and become a true biology student. if you love biology TAKE THIS CLASS. To all my premeds out there: don't take this class bc/ it's harder than bio12 and you don't get any benefit from taking a harder class. I am a bio major and not premed so this class was PERFECT for me but Ik some of my premed friends in this class were disappointed with how hard it was and the their final grades.\"",
            "review 8: \"21F with Magdalena Bezanilla: This class gave me sooo many mixed emotions. It was my favorite class of the term and the material was super interesting, and Bezanilla is an amazing lecturer. You can tell she's so knowledgeable about whatever she's talking about and she's good at describing things. However, the exams were awful and made me so close to dropping the class. The exams were all on how to solve hypothetical scenarios rather than relying on memorization. She even lets you use a study sheet to help you review and show that the exam is not about memorization. This means that you REALLY have to know the material throughly, not just understand it. It took me a while to realize this and how much work the class really required from you. The teaching fellow Miranda was amazing and so helpful, and had great practice problems too. My recommendation is to go to all the review sessions, including the x-hour which is used as office hours, and do all the practice problems. Overall, it was an amazing class that now makes me want to major in cell bio but it was also awful because I felt stupid the whole term because of my exam grades lol. It's also important to note the unique experience of BIOL 19 as opposed to 12. 12 is a super large class whereas 19 has about 20 people. Everyone knows each other, there's one lab section, and Bezanilla tries hard to learn everyone's names as soon as possible. This class definitely creates an easy way to actually get to know the prof, and if it's Bezanilla teaching, she's definitely a prof worth getting to know, especially if you want to do anything in bio. Basically, DO NOT TAKE if the \"honors\" distinction seems fancy to you or you think it will give you a leg up in any sort of way (looking at you premeds). There is genuinely no advantage of taking a class labeled as \"honors\". The plus side is a small class with a great prof. The minus side is that is class is TOUGH and the people you're competing against with the median are the brightest bio students that applied for the class. Think this through if this is actually want you want to do.\"",
            "review 9: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: I really loved this class and it\u2019s inspired me to continue taking biology classes. That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t difficult and a lot of students, including myself, had trouble throughout the term. Professor Benzanilla was super accessible and passionate, which made the content really interesting. In terms of workload, I never felt overwhelmed by this class but biology classes often require you to study consistently instead of in one final push, so I would recommend taking \u201clighter\u201d classes with it. We almost never had homework. Exams were unavoidably difficult and I found myself studying for almost a full week before each one of them. The labs were fine, but the papers seemed like a way to drag down your lab grade, so if you take the class make sure to get started on them early. Definitely take this class if you\u2019re interested in medicine or molecular/cellular biology, but just don\u2019t take it because you \u201cwant to learn more about biology\u201d. I went in with AP Bio and AP Chem and, while neither of them are super important for the course content, it\u2019s definitely helpful to have a background in chemistry and basic biology. Chemistry is definitely the more important of the two: the basic biology is taught well, but the chemistry is hard, especially if you have no background.\"",
            "review 10: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: An amazing class. Professor Bezanilla is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the course material and takes the time after every class to answer any questions. AP biology does not prepare you very well for this course, but I found it manageable nevertheless. There is quite a lot of material but every friday is reserved for practice problems and the graduate students are extremely helpful in creating review sessions weekly. It was remote this term, so labs were weird but the lab reports lacked specific instructions and were not graded leniently. Midterms are every two weeks on the material from the last two weeks, but are all very application of technology based so knowledge of the material is crucial. I personally recommend this for anyone who finds biology interesting, regardless of how much you've done in the past studying it.\"",
            "review 11: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: Only apply for/take this course if you know you have an interest in cellular/molecular biology and you're willing to spend LOTS of time outside of class preparing for lectures and studying for the test. Prof. Bezanilla is incredibly nice, passionate about the subject, and an amazing lecturer and made materials for the course very accessible for the Zoom environment. I highly recommend taking this class with two easier/layup non-STEM courses so you don't get too bogged down with work. The lab is interesting enough, but I've heard it's much better in person. I'd also say to only take this class if you have some background in chemistry- it gets confusing really fast if you don't. AP Biology in high school is not ample preparation for this course. There are two written assignments in lab (a lab report and a research proposal), and those along with the midterms are graded harshly. Don't expect an A out of this course, but it is still very interesting and I'd say take it if you have a very strong interest in bio.\"",
            "review 12: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: This class is incredibly challenging, but definitely manageable. As a Bio major, I took this class because I was genuinely interested. It was a ton of work, lots of hours of independent studying, practice sessions, office hours, labs, etc... VERY time consuming do not take it if you truly don't care about the material, you'd be better off taking an easier biology class. Still, Professor Bezanilla is amazing. She is the perfect balance of humble. She is brilliant but won't come off as arrogant nor pretentious. Rather, she has no need to show off her intelligence, since it will speak for itself as she lectures. Clearly she is passionate about these topics, and is always willing to answer any and every question. She holds office hours twice a week, which are extremely helpful if you want to bombard her with questions, or just go and chat about life. Labs are once a week. These were horrific. I assume they're better in person, but virtually they were incredibly boring. The good thing was that they were quite easy *IN THE BEGINNING* and then around week 6 they got so hard for no reason. The TAs and the lab director were not too helpful nor directive. The two BIG lab assignments (a lab report and a research proposal experiment) were graded too harshly, and as freshmen who don't have much background knowledge in a lab setting, we were left in the dark about what the expectations were. While one of the TAs (Thao) was a gem, the other one (Brennan) is the most passive aggressive person ever (NOT NICE NOR HELPFUL). Definitely take this class if you want a GOOD FOUNDATION in biology. You will learn a lot!! The challenge is then RETENTION! Also, I forgot to mention it above, but there are weekly review sessions with the Teaching Science Fellow (Miranda) who is an ABSOLUTE GODDESS. She is INCREDIBLY HELPFUL, SO GOOD AT EXPLAINING, and also just super chill and nice. BY ALL MEANS, DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS AND GO TO THESE REVIEW SESSIONS!!! These problems are basically the same type of questions that will arise in an exam, so take advantage of Miranda!! She will save your grade.\"",
            "review 13: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: The content of this class is really fun to learn about if you have an interest in cell/molecular biology. I took AP Bio/Chem in high school and it was mostly enough preparation. There are some concepts that the course assumes you're familiar with that aren't covered in AP Bio, but you can learn about those from the textbook (a bootleg copy is available) or office hours. This term (since it was virtual) the tests were open note and open book, so it's much more important to understand the concepts than memorize names of proteins - still, the tests can be brutal. To succeed, you will need to set aside a lot of time for studying, go to review sessions, follow Prof. Bezanilla's and Miranda's advice for studying, and ideally form a study group. Prof. Bezanilla is great - her lectures and course materials are clear and accessible, she's very responsive and helpful answering questions, and she's done a lot of research in the fields that the course covers. She's also really personable and friendly. The Teaching Science Fellow, Miranda, was incredibly helpful during review sessions and office hours. Also just a great person. The lab was a chore. I don't think there's anything to be done about that as long as it's virtual. You have three hours for a ten-question assignment though, so you can make it fun if you have lab partners you can dick around with. The questions are mostly easy, and for the ones that aren't, the TAs will walk you through them. Both of them (Thao and Brennan) were very approachable and helpful. I have no idea how Brennan came across to someone as passive aggressive and unhelpful. Dr. Warren seemed fine but honestly I don't know what she did. There are two papers for the lab. They are not very clear with their expectations for these, nor do they teach you the skills to write them. They are not forgiving when grading them either. Do most of it before the office hours for the assignment, so you can ask questions on the things they don't tell you.\"",
            "review 14: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I thought I liked biology, but I was WRONG. I came in as a biology major and now I'm majoring in English. The tests/midterms are every two weeks, so there is little to no time to breathe or take a break. Thankfully, I was taking two other much easier/lighter courses, so I was able to keep up, but I often felt like I was drowning in all the work. I had to rewatch every lecture before the midterm, meaning I was often spending eight or more hours just rewatching lectures in preparation for the test. I will say that Professor Bezanilla was very accessible and the Teaching Science Fellow was INCREDIBLE (thank god for the TSF, she was the ONLY reason I did as well as I did in that class, other reviews were absolutely correct, she is a GODDESS). The labs were incredibly boring and often were graded harshly, especially later in the term. The lab director was not useful at all and I'm not actually sure what she did the entire term, because the TAs did everything. The two written lab assignments (a lab report and an experimental design) were absolutely terrible and graded so harshly; they were definitely there to take your lab grade down. Literally, I never rested in this class. Also, be warned, the people this class attracts are not very welcoming or friendly, to put it simply. Most were very overeager and just trying to cinch a rec letter from the professor. If you have the stomach to deal with the perpetual ass-kissing, go for it, but I regret taking this class. Good luck.\"",
            "review 15: \"20F with Magdalena Bezanilla: This class is incredibly draining and taxing, both with time and mental health. The professor is incredibly nice, very good at teaching, and generous with her time. That\u2019s where the fun ends. If you think this class will be easy because you were good at AP Biology or scored well on the SAT Subject Test Biology, you are SORELY mistaken. If you think research experience will help you, it will (slightly), but almost everyone in this class has previous research experience and after the first two weeks, you\u2019ll succumb to the difficulty of the material. High school was child\u2019s play. If you want to tread water in this class, GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND REVIEW SESSIONS. You cannot succeed without the Teaching Science Fellow\u2019s review sessions. Miranda is literally a goddess. She is so smart, so kind, so helpful. She literally deserves a professor\u2019s salary. Rewatch the lectures before every test!! It\u2019s a pain in the behind, and it will give you moderate to severe depression, but it will allow you to barely succeed. This class moves so fast and the material is incredibly dense. By the time you finish a test and think you can relax, boom your next test is coming up and so is your next mental breakdown. For the first few weeks, you\u2019ll think to yourself \u201cwell it\u2019s only really hard now because I just started college and this unit is just particularly hard, I never learned about this in high school so of course it\u2019s difficult.\u201d Let me stop you right there before you laugh yourself to Dick\u2019s House Mental Health Counseling. It does not get easier in this class. The pace picks up to paces I didn\u2019t even know were possible. This class is somewhat collaborative, but in all honesty, half of them are ultra try hard premeds trying to gain a letter of recommendation from the professor. They really need Xanax, pet therapy, and an in-depth psychological evaluation about their ambition for their career choices. If given the chance to go through 20F course selection again, I would NOT take this class and just take bio 12. If you\u2019re premed and think this will give you a one-up in med school admissions, trust me that it won\u2019t. They don\u2019t care if one of your classes has the word honors in front of it. Only take this class if you are taking other easy classes. The tests are really hard, but she drops the lowest one which is nice. The professor\u2019s super nice, very knowledgeable, very down-to-earth. Labs were okay, didn\u2019t really learn much, TAs were present to say the least, the two out-of-class lab assignments were so much work and time. Now, addressing the lies of the other BIOL19 reviews on here. Someone said that on Fridays, you do review problems. This is a complete and utter lie. I don\u2019t know where that came from, but this is not true. Also, the TAs do not make review sessions. It is only the TSF Miranda, praise be her name, and let\u2019s put credit where it\u2019s due. Again, this is so important, if you don\u2019t do and practice Miranda\u2019s review problems, YOU WILL FAIL. This class took up most of my mental energy and all of my will to live and just thank god that we\u2019re on the quarter system and don\u2019t have to suffer for 16 weeks. Good luck freshmen. P.S. Miranda, if you\u2019re reading this, you deserve the world. You were so helpful in this class and I probably wouldn\u2019t have passed without you. I feel bad for future classes that don\u2019t have you as a TSF.\"",

I have learned a lot from this class.

This course requires a lot of time if you want to do well from attending weekly review sessions (which I really recommend), self-studying, meeting with the teaching fellow, lab, lab TA hours etc. However, this course has a decent curve and even though I failed two of the three midterms I still ended up with a B in the course. The material is interesting and having taken other foundations courses and had them be much easier to manage I have to say that this course prepares you well for being a bio major at Dartmouth.

Miranda, our TA, is also incredibly helpful as she hosts two review sessions each week with questions that reflect class content. If you are a freshman considering biology and are able to place into this class, I would highly recommend taking it.\"",
            "review 21: \"18F with Magdalena Bezanilla: A new offering 18F, BIOL 19 is akin to PHYS 15 or CHEM 10\u2014an honors STEM course just for freshmen that takes the place of a foundational intro. course. From what I understood, we mostly paralleled BIOL 12 in terms of content, but having a class capped at 20 first-year students with 2 TAs and a personable, passionate professor was a great addition to my freshman fall. If you can get in, are interested in memorizing the nitty gritty of cell biology, and willing to put in time to rewatching lectures outside of class, you will do fine. That being said, because slots in the class are allotted by application, the median reflects 20 super-qualified students (the vast majority of whom have done lab research in high school and/or are pre-med), and sometimes it did feel like arbitrarily small point differences on exams would lead to large grade swings because the class's grade spread was narrow and some median was being targeted. Still, the atmosphere was friendly, and exams were fair. Prof. Bezanilla is very accessible and dedicated to teaching, and fostered a warm albeit focused vibe.If you're trying to make your transcript look good with the word \"honors\" or if you're looking for a class with more discussion, conceptual thinking, readings, etc... you might be disappointed by the focus on memorization and lecture in this course. But if you want to explore or pursue biology at Dartmouth, I think this is a great class for your freshman fall.\""

The material is dense and can be tricky to understand, but there aren't really many assignments outside of lectures and the paper discussions. The papers were very hard to read at first, but it definitely got easier through out the term. You should be fine even if you have no previous experience reading scientific papers. Overall a very good class. Probably medium difficultly.\"",
            "review 2: \"23F with Bing He: This was a great class! Super interesting and professor He is so awesome. he's super caring and very sweet and good at explaining stuff. Content was really interesting and i liked the structure of the class a lot, felt like i came out of it with a much better grasp of reading scientific literature and applying it in class. would recommend for bio majors\"",
            "review 3: \"23F with Bing He: Prof He is great. He really cares about his students and wants them to get the most out of his class. The structure is 3 exams, not cumulative, which make up in total around 50-60% of your grade, and the rest is participation and paper discussions (each assignment worth about 5%). There are pre-lecture videos but I think the longest one was around 13 minutes. Compared to other STEM courses, this one is really front-loaded in that the lectures are harder to understand in the first unit because you don't have as much base information yet and they get easier as the term goes along. The same goes for the research papers (you read around one a week and have a paper discussion response for them). In my opinion the topics got more interesting as the term went on especially since prof He teaches a lot from primary literature so we understand the research techniques that lead to the discovery of all of the things we learned. Definitely not a layup, but again a class that becomes less stressful and time-consuming as the term goes on which is really nice when your other classes ramp up. We didn't meet for X hours except once at the end of the term. Also, exams are completely open note which reduces the stress of memorization so studying just means going through and making sure you understand the lecture material and research papers, and professor He is very willing to answer questions both during class and office hours. I would definitely recommend this course.\"",
            "review 4: \"22F with Bing He: I absolutely loved this class. Epithelial tissues are not at all what I thought i would be learning about in my biology major, but he's such a wonderful and engaging professor. He tells jokes (most of which don't land, but you have to appreciate the effort) and is just the sweetest person to talk to--it feels like he genuinely wants to know about you. Class-wise, there aren't that many lectures (I think there were 16 in total, and the class meets 3x a week, or 30 times over the term) but there are some pre-lecture recordings. These were only 10-15 minutes at most, and weren't that dense, so you could get them done in about 20 minutes. The remaining class periods were paper discussions (you read and present on 6) and in-class activities. Overall, I think the variation made sure that the class never got boring and I learned a lot! The midterms and final were difficult for sure but the questions were entirely fair (just required a lot of application of knowledge). That being said, participation is a huge part of your grade so even if the midterms don't go that well. you can get many points elsewhere and still end up fine.\"",
            "review 5: \"22F with Bing He: Agree with everything the previous reviewer said. Definitely not a lay-up but an interesting class where you learn a lot at a pretty reasonable pace. Felt faster near the start and then settled into a more manageable rhythm at the end. Exams require thought rather than regurgitation but they are open note. Just do the practice exams and come to review sessions with questions. Prof He is a great guy and a joy to take a class with.\"",
            "review 6: \"21F with Bing He: I loved this class. Prof He is very chill and cares a ton about his students and his subject. He was great with disability accommodations. There were 30-45 mins of prerecorded lecture before each class, and we would come to class asking questions and digging deeper. Then we worked through practice problems in groups. The subject matter is SUPER interesting (I'm a huge bio nerd, so learning about how epithelial cells signal each other and interact via feedback loops and molecular interactions is really cool to me). Every other week, we read a relevant paper and present in groups on one of the figures in the paper. There were three exams, open notes, but you only have 65 minutes to finish. The exams were well made. Hard but fair.\"",
            "review 7: \"21F with Bing He: Biol41 with Prof He is a phenomenal class. It feels like a sequel to Biol12, if that gives context, but it's narrower in scope and deeper in details. First of all, Prof He is a joy. He's enthusiastic about answering student questions and helping students understand the intuition and logic behind biological discovery and methods. The lecture structure is broken up most weeks by having students read scientific papers and present on figures, methods, and findings within the various sections. This was my favorite part of the class. The papers that were selected were highly relevant to the lecture material, and the lectures did a great job of giving students background in order to begin to understand the papers. Having students dive deeply into the literature and elucidate what figures mean, why researchers chose the methods they chose, and understand how things were learned as opposed to just teaching us the researchers' findings, gave depth into what otherwise would simply be a class about multicellular organization. I feel much more comfortable reading biology papers after this class, which is a huge asset. For assessment, there are the weekly paper presentations, two midterms, and a non-cumulative final (although the various methods we study are cumulative, and students are expected to remember how research techniques work). I also need to emphasize how great Prof He is once again. He's truly a gem of a professor who cares a lot about students and teaching. I should also note that being rusty on Biol12 material isn't a huge issue. I took Biol12 during the Covid-19 20S pass/fail term, so I really didn't remember too much from then. When Biol12 material is particularly relevant in what we're learning, he's sure to review it and make sure we're all on the same page before proceeding. This is a great mid-level biology course, and I recommend it to anybody who took Biol12 and is interested in extending that knowledge to more integrated organ and tissue processes.\"",
            "review 8: \"20F with Bing He: Professor He is one of the best professors at Dartmouth! This class is super interesting; however, it\u2019s a LOT of work! The exams are incredibly hard, but not unfair. It\u2019s way more detailed than bio 12, but definitely more interesting. If you\u2019re taking this class, make sure to take it with a layup because the pre-lectures are dense and the articles are very complex. Professor He is my favorite Bio professor and he did not disappoint.\"",
            "review 9: \"20F with Bing He: Professor He is amazing! The lectures were interesting and the in-class activities were very helpful. Prof. He gave us a lot of his time to make sure we fully understood the material. He really wants everyone to succeed in the class. There are weekly paper readings and a presentation with a group on part of the paper. There are three exams that are not cumulative. I would definitely recommend this class if you are at all interested in multi-cellular organization.\""

The work load was very manageable - with 4 500 word essays and a final 1500 word essay. She was very receptive to what we wanted to learn about as a class and tailored her teaching to us. She also taught us to write in a very concise scientific style, which was very different from anything I had done and very beneficial.\"",
            "review 2: \"22S with Brittny Calsbeek: Very interesting and relevant topics are covered, manageable workload, but moves quite fast. Class structure: Topic introduction in class, readings out of class, discussion in class, outline out of class, peer review in class, rough draft out of class, peer review in class, final paper out of class, and repeat. 4 smaller papers (500 words), 1 final research paper (1000-1500 words). Calsbeek is nice and understanding but quite picky about the writing. The scientific writing style is kinda cool, but it's made difficult to learn bc of Calsbeek's standards. She wants us to be extremely specific in these papers about an extremely complex scientific concept, with only 500 words. Additionally, she wants us to cite nearly everything we say (somewhat reasonable for a scientific paper, but also unnatural in writing) but we are also expected to come up with our own argument/stance on a topic that the vast majority of scientists agree on a particular argument. Good class, I grew as a writer, but a bit frustrating.\"",
            "review 3: \"21S with Brittny Calsbeek: This class was fine. The topics werent super interesting but the papers were like 500 words and there were only 4 of them so it wasnt that much work. We also didnt meet most days so its nice to have the extra time off. Prof Calsbeek is so nice and so fun to talk to. I wouldnt say shes a super easy grader but I also wouldn't call her harsh. Pretty fair in my opinion.\"",
            "review 4: \"18S with Brittny Calsbeek: This seminar was okay (and I probably would have liked it more than I did if it hadn't been offered during the 9L block in the LSC). It wasn't an overwhelming amount of work, but Prof. Calsbeek was a pretty tough grader on essays, which were only about 500 words (with the exception of a 1500 - 2000 word final paper) but have to be intensely grounded in research. The sentences also have to be extremely concise, almost excessively so. Never in my life have I written a 500 word essay so meticulously (it was also hard to keep them even close to 500 words) - and we had to do five of them. Many students were also surprised by the lack of emphasis on morality, ethics, and politics in this course - it focused almost exclusively on scientific concepts, which we had to incorporate heavily into our writing. I don't know how it got an A median in 17S with the same prof that I had - I barely scraped by with an A- and I worked really hard. I've heard that the professor during 18W wasn't as challenging. That being said, if you're not comfortable with taking a college-level, rigorous science course with exams, it's probably a worthwhile way to get a science distrib. Bio 007.02 is undoubtedly much less painful than Bio 2, Chem 5, Bio 11, Physics 13, or the like. However, if you are a science person / major and don't need the distrib, I'd recommend using your first-year seminar to get a LIT, SOC, or TMV distrib.\"",
            "review 5: \"18S with Brittny Calsbeek: I took this class thinking that it would be a layup because of the 17S class; however, it was definitely not as easy as I expected it to be. This seminar was interesting, you got to look at scientific controversies that remain relevant in today's society as well as our future. Calsbeek was an okay prof...but she was a slightly harsh grader. Once you got the grade on your first essay (which were graded out of 20), it felt like no matter how scientific or concise you made your paper, you would end up within a plus/minus .25 of your first grade. As far as work goes, it wasn't that bad. You had 5 500 word essays and a 1500 word final that were based on a controversial scientific topic. The papers had to be well researched and your sources had to come from scientific papers. Your sentences NEEDED to be incredibly short and concise. Transition words like However and Therefore were sometimes frowned upon. Get to know Calsbeek well and consult her frequently for feedback, this way you can find out exactly what she looks for in the essay...which is something that students in my class found helpful. Overall, cool class but definitely need to work to get an A.\"",
            "review 6: \"18S with Brittny Calsbeek: Definitely not a bad class, especially if you're looking to knock out a SCI distrib. Calsbeek is a very nice, very understanding prof who I ended up liking quite a bit. For the most part, I found the course material to be interesting but easy (but, to be fair, I took AP bio in high school and a bio course at Dartmouth that counts towards the major). The workload for the class is extremely manageable: in-class discussions, presentations, and short essays on each topic you cover. The most frustrating part of this class is the essay grading. I was left with the impression that the grading was a little unnecessarily nitpicky/confusing so as to maintain an A- median. That being said, once you figure out what Prof Calsbeek is looking for in the essays (especially in terms of structure), you can get consistently good essay grades. There is a definite learning curve to writing the essays, but if you can figure out the formula for writing them you'll do well. I had a couple of bad essay grades, went to office hours a few times to ask for constructive feedback, and managed to pull off an A for the term. Prof Calsbeek is looking for you to get into a scientific explanation of the issue in your essays in which you demonstrate you have a reasonable understanding of whatever topic you're writing about. Don't write your first essay on why climate change is bad unless you also are writing a section on the causes of climate change (even if it seems obvious to you). My biggest piece of advice for this class (and any class, really) is to go to office hours. If you need a SCI distrib and want a manageable workload, definitely take the class. If you're expecting to receive an A no matter what, take something else-- you'll just get frustrated by the essay-grading.\""

He would give some sentences of feedback with a grade after each essay but it was hard to implement into the next essay directly to show improvement.

Problem sets are actually horrific like they're not even problem sets they're these very unclear case studies with very little context. You are presented with one or two fictional patients that have some set of symptoms related to that week's topic and you have to come up with a hypothesis of why that patient has those symptoms and come up with experiments to test that hypothesis. Sounds easy enough, but Witters will offer absolutely NO HELP WHATSOEVER in office hours regarding the problem set. Even questions about how to format the margins. Grading is basically how well can you read the professor's mind because there are no \"right\" answers but there are certainly many MANY wrong answers. I managed to hit on most of the wrong answers and almost none of the right ones, myself, personally. Grading ends up fine tho. Expecting an A or an A-. The whole thing was very mid in my opinion. Def not a favorite but also didn't make me hate my life for 10 weeks like other classes in our lovely bio department at Dartmouth College <3.\"",

Every Friday, Dr. Witters gives a lecture on a topic in biochemistry, ranging from cancer to diabetes to aging and more. Every Monday and Wednesday, a pair or trio of students will give a paper presentation, and then on the weekends, you will have a complex problem set to complete on topics related to Dr. Witters' lecture and the paper presentations. These problem sets were extremely complicated; they would pose some kind of question about a disease or mutation, and you would have to propose a hypothesis and then come up with an in-depth and comprehensive experimental technique. They usually took up one entire day of the weekend, but we were allowed to collaborate with other students, which really helped enhance understanding, especially because Dr. Witters won't really answer questions once the problem set is released. He does grade somewhat arbitrarily (no one really got 10/10), but as long as you're putting in work you will get a good grade. There were 7 problem sets throughout the term (Dr. Witters dropped one this term due to some external circumstances - it's usually 8), but you only have to complete 5. You also will have to do one paper presentation, which for the most part is fine - Dr. Witters helps you prepare for it, so make sure you come to him prepared with questions. The last part of your grade is participation, which is really easy to get, just try to talk once in a while when presenters are asking questions (it doesn't matter if you're wrong!). Overall, this course helped me deepen my understanding of biochemistry, but definitely don't be fooled by the median and be prepared to put in a good amount of work.\"",

Each week there are also two research papers presented by students on whatever disease is the topic of that week. Despite how difficult the psets were and how long it took to pull together the presentation, each disease we discussed had a biochemical lens and was super interesting, and the class is really engaging. Also, Witters is awesome. He makes himself really available for help, holding office hours every weekday and setting up private meetings whenever people wanted, whether it's getting help with the class or even getting advice with medical school applications. TLDR: this is a great class if you have the time and energy to put into the psets. You'll get out of the class what you put into it, and Witters rewards hard work.\"",

Though the class/lectures were great, the actual work in the class was a bit rough. This is not to say the workload was unreasonable or exceedingly tough, but it just got a bit tedious. If you are up to date with biology research and common methods, you'll be fine. But the weekly papers we wrote basically required you to know lab procedures. So it heavily favored majors, especially those with lab experience. Most of the work on the hw was researching lab techniques. But the only work was these weekly papers (and one presentation) which made it much more reasonable than other premed/bio classes. Overall the course was well taught and Witters is a good lecturer, but the HW got to be a little too one sided.

I cannot help but admire his willingness and desire to help, and I suppose that in the end, most people like him. His dedication to his students really is unquestionable. So why the bad review? I am the type of student who needs to know that the grade I am getting is the result of my abilities and my work and not the result of groveling and sucking up. The grading in class and the professor's interpersonal friendships should always remain separate; yes, it is nice to have a cooperative atmosphere where everyone knows each other and where the students get along with the professors, but that is where it should end. Friendship with the professor should not be forced onto the students, and I feel that is almost what Professor (yes, professor, not Lee) Witters tried to do. Lemme give you a newsflash: I don't want to be your friend. He also almost expects students to go to his office hours. I don't feel as though office hours should be mandatory as a prereq for getting a good grade. So, his class is not just class on ability, it is class on ability along with how much he likes you (if he likes you a lot, he probably subconsciously tacks on 1 point out of 10 to each of your assignments). In all honesty, he grades pretty fairly and if you're a superstar in biology, you'll get the grade you deserve. The problem is that the best grades go to the superstars, the next best grades go to those who go to his office hours to \"learn.\" And don't tell us that the office hours before the presentations are for us and that they are optional. They are clearly mandatory and if we didn't go to them, you would have been very offended. Just tell it how it is. I don't want to play your game Witters. I really wanted this review to be fair. I know I am going against the norm. Witters, after all, is the God of all premeds. Some of you will disagree adamantly with this review, but look at yourself closely. You are probably one of the sycophants. Oh, and finally, I have some problem with the \"problem sets.\" The primary method of evaluation in the course was 6 or 7 problems in which the class could work with other members of the class for \"helpful discussions.\" The problems were experimentally based and required some research. What happened with these problem sets is as follows: The superstars would work by themselves because they wouldn't need anyone's help to get a good grade, so they figure, well, why should we discuss with others if it will only slow me down and raise the overall median of the class? Then the rest of the class would break up into around 3 groups that would end up being basically the same people each time. Within these groups, there would be 1 or 2 people who would do 80% of the work for the \"helpful discussions.\" Then there are the wanderers who go to as many \"helpful discussions\" as possible so that they can pick and choose whatever they like best - being part of the 20% of each group - and get a good grade without ever understanding any pathways or ever inciting one brain cell to think biology. The groups eventually became inclusive as the 80% workers became tired of doing work for all the rest of the group. Clap clap clap for \"helpful discussions.\"\""

Whereas, Professor Dolph just dishes out the material straight, like medicine. Some of the concepts were interesting and certainly important, but on the whole, I simply didn't enjoy the course. Professor Dolph organized coherent lectures, but did not make effective use of visuals. There was hardly ever a slide or graph or picture. For instance, after Prof. Dolph took the time to explain a mechanism for a system and the regulation of such a mechanism, he would move on to the next topic. However, this initial description was very lacking without a visual cue to cohesively tie the concepts together. Thus I found it very difficult to absorb the material in 78, whereas 77 was a challenging breeze. Prof. Dolph is generally a nice guy, but, to me, he didn't seem to be the most approachable professor here on campus... by a long shot.

Each class period (it was a 10A), three different students gave presentations on the same drug, and each had a slightly different focus: the molecular/neurological aspects, the physiological effects on the body, and the societal impact/stigma of the drugs. Velez did not teach one single bit. The entire class was student presentations, and they were each 30% of your final grade. Since attendance was mandatory (it made up the remaining 10% of your grade), you basically had to show up every Tu/Thu and listen to your classmates present. There was absolutely no incentive to pay attention whatsoever (unless the student happened to be an especially gifted or engaging lecturer), so most people ended up bringing their computers, spacing out, doing other HW, etc. The presentations were graded rubric-style, but you never knew exactly what he was looking for (so you'd get random points of for random things), and the emphasis was a lot more on style (and if you made it really close to the 35-limit without going over) rather than content. The only things I took away from this course were things that will probably help me in the future, anyway.

The biggest advice about this class is just know what you're getting into. Yes it's completely lecture based but I promise you, as a senior biology major, any undergraduate student will LEARN more from a class where the prof does their job and lectures. If you want a lit based class, go to grad school or join a journal club. No undergrad actually knows enough biology to get a lot out of this class other than knowing the 25 latest minute molecules that have been implicated in cancer. You will NOT learn the basics of cancer biology in this class. Also, the assignments and discussions are HIGHLY based on lab techniques.

The final problem set was due on the last day of class, meaning no finals period was used for this class. Regardless, the course is not too bad at all. To be honest, you don't even need to really read the papers besides the ones associated with your projects-- but it's still good to skim them since we sometimes do class-wide paper discussions. However, you do have to be careful about the grading of these assignments. Professor Grotz wants everything to be worded a certain way but she doesn't tell you her standard until it's too late. This was most evident when we got our first grade from week 2's problem set back at the end of week 8, which at that point we already finished most of the course. There was nothing we could realistically modify except our final assignment. Additionally, on this note, it's a really odd feeling only knowing 10% of your grade by the time the course ends.

Essentially, professor McClung aims to cover a wide variety of topics dealing with 1) the regulation of gene expression at many levels; 2) the newest and most interesting tools a geneticist has at his/her disposal. The workload for the class was very manageable. For each lecture there was a paper or set of papers assigned from the literature. Many in the class read these papers. However, I did not. It was possible to follow lecture without having read the papers assigned for each day. I can imagine that the class would have taken me many more hours had I read each of the lecture papers. That said, I am also sure that I would have benefited more from this class had I read literature papers on a more regular basis. The grading for this class appears reasonable. It is a very nice thing not to have exams in BIO 65. Instead, you have a weekly assignment due. You have to read a paper or two and then answer a single question in detail. You are allowed (in fact, encouraged) to discuss in groups -- and this is most beneficial to all. However, throughout the term, there are two BIG assignments. You have to read papers in the literature and then answer 10 questions or more! NOT EASY! Especially given the incisive questions McClung asks . . . like: \"Design an experiment to identify all the fly genes directly activated by TCF. How would you determine if TCF also negatively regulates genes? And how would you identify the set of genes negatively regulated by TCF?\" Note that each question usually has multiple components and questions embedded within it. This is one of McClung's quirks. He can never ask you a SINGLE question. Anyways, I digress. This course was a great experience, a nice foray into the biological literature (both classic and recent), and made for interesting discussions and cool material. The course differed from week to week, depending upon the topic. Some topics were pretty boring. Others were mildly interesting but belabored. Still, others were fascinating.

He knows that STORY is the key to any communication, and he conveys that both in how he lectures and in how he writes papers. This class, more than being about RNA, is about HOW TO COMMUNICATE as a biologist. Don't get me wrong, you learn TONS of crazy stuff about RNA that goes beyond anything you've ever learned, but the class is fundamentally about communication, and it ROCKS. Kev's personality is abrasive to some people--there's a lot of class interaction during his lectures, and he is not afraid of poking fun or lightly roasting students. He's a jokester and a bit of a troll, but he really has a heart of gold. For a few weeks I thought he hated me, but turns out he really liked me. At the end of the term, he plans a party for the class and brings beer. What you're graded on: you and two other students are working together to write a professional-style literature review on some RNA topic that could hypothetically be published in a journal. Each group presents their paper to the class on a different week. Each week, the entire class \"roasts\" that week's group's paper, taking it through two rounds of peer reviewing and critique. (So the assignments each week are to read the group's paper, and submit a few critiques.) He also has the class read a published paper each week and discuss it.

In fact, the prof says that undergrads always do better. It just requires that you put in a lot of effort to make sure that you understand what's going on. The whole class was basically building mathematical models, starting from Lotka-Volterra predation with only two species and gradually adding on more complexities and variations, and then analyzing what happens and how to get multiple species coexisting. It's really helpful to actually construct and work with these models on your own time so that you become familiar with how they work; that's also what the homework problems (which are the sole basis for your grade) make you do. There was a \"lab\" part where we'd meet during the x-hour to work with computer models, but that involved computer programming and I was just as glad that it just kind of faded out.

I can\u2019t really explain it, but the powerpoints are laid out in a not always logical fashion. You adjust after a while, but it was kind of jarring at first. Since we took it online, the testing experience was very different. All our exams were open note open lecture, but he told us that our exams were pretty familiar to the in class ones-which, if that's true, the amount of material insane. Our medians on an open note exam were somewhere around 78-83ish for all exams. I know from Echo recordings the median on the 2nd exam is typically a 76-78, This class is Bio14 on steroids. Most questions are super super detailed memorization, but there are a few that actually require in depth thinking and your memorization knowledge. I feel that on every exam there\u2019s usually 2-5 points that I thought were totally meant to tank you and we did not have the knowledge to to comprehend. Otherwise, pretty fair, but if Bio14 levels of memorization were a struggle for you, run from this class. It\u2019s a huge amount of (very interesting) material. On the whole, I think Prof Hoppa is really great, but Prof Maue (who we listened to from old echo lectures) is a better lecturer. Hoppa has a tendency to get almost overexcited but the material and forget to just give a clear statement of what\u2019s happening while Maue just goes through things like a nice outline. Often I had to stop the lecture and just copy what was on the slide to even begin to see what Hoppa was getting at. Which, again, you just adjust after a while and go clarify in office hours-which are pretty fun cause he\u2019s so excited. Overall, this class has some really interesting material, and I don't want to dissuade you from taking it because it is honestly a really interesting and worthwhile class. I really disliked the first couple lectures because they were more macro and that isn\u2019t my favorite. But then it gets really really focused on micro and you end by learning about diseases. If this class makes you super excited and you just love neuroscience stuff, go ahead and take it. Profs are great, fair but challenging exams, and once you adjust to the lectures, it\u2019s pretty fun. It was a really good experience despite me not always liking lectures, and it was totally worth it. I\u2019m not a neuro major-but the brain is still pretty cool.\"",
            "review 3: \"20S with Michael Hoppa: This class was really great. Don't be scared to take this class with little bio background. Prof Hoppa does a really thorough job of teaching everything you need to know for the exams. There was nothing on the exams that wasn't in the lecture or the slides. There is recommended reading to go with every lecture but it is optional and is not covered in the tests. The tests are time consuming but not all that hard. It is a lot of content for sure but it is incredibly interesting. Not a layup but it won't break your GPA either and Prof Hoppa makes himself available for weekly class review sessions as well as office hours for more specific questions.\""

Genomics is simply a fascinating subfield.

Very cool class, but gets technical pretty fast. Grading is based on two midterm exams (very fair - not insanely difficult, but certainly not easy) and a final project/research paper. The final project is time consuming, but rewarding - in 20F, using the available DNA/amino acid sequences for a given SARS-CoV-2 protein, we had to analyze the protein's phylogenetic relationships with other coronaviruses using almost every tool we had learned throughout the course of the class.

Would definitely recommend it for any BIO major. Also not just regurgitation and asks that you think thoughtfully to design experiments. Not the easiest and tests more looked at if you could apply concepts.\"",
            "review 2: \"21S with Erik Griffin: This class was great. Prof Griffin is the ideal professor and also it's hard to do (too) bad in the class; 40% of the grade basically just consists of going to class, answering a few short Canvas prompts throughout the term, and doing the final project (which was super interesting too). The other 60% is equally split between 3 exams (they aren't miserable by any means, but they aren't a piece of cake either--they completely depend on thoughtful problem solving ability so how familiar you are with the material doesn't really help (or at least it didn't in my case). In hindsight the tests are probably a great evaluative method because they're geared to make you think like a researcher rather than regurgitate content, but at the end of the day I don't think universally that your effort/understanding will correlate with your grade (e.g. I felt that I understood the material of the course to the extent of courses I've gotten A's in but will likely end out with less than a B+ because of misinterpreting questions that could have been more clear or not figuring out a genetic experiment strategy within the time constraint of the test). I think it may be also worth noting that, on one of the exams, nearly half of my points were lost in spots that I fully understood but misinterpreted the questions because they weren't as clear as they could have been. I'm not sure if this was a problem only I had, or if Prof Griffin was making them a little trickier than need be to make sure we didn't do TOO well (which I wouldn't expect to be the case because he's very kind so maybe it's just me). The layout of the course isn't stressful or rushed. The material you do go over is very very interesting, but if I had one down side of the class it would be that I didn't come out feeling like I learned a great amount of stuff. For instance, this term I took BIOL 35 (AWESOME class--250% recommend) which has some overlapping material. At one point we spent about two weeks in BIOL 43 on processes that were covered within like 30 minutes of one lecture in BIOL 35 and if anything in more detail. At the end of the day, you're paying thousands of dollars to learn so for me that's a big factor. Honestly, the class is interesting with an awesome layout and great prof. But most importantly for me, and I'm not sure if this is too specific to be relatable: it really isn't a course where a better understanding of what you learn will get you anywhere. On Exam 1 I hardly studied because I already felt confident. On Exam 2 I did 10-15 hours of intensive studying because I wanted to perform better and ended up doing 1% worse. TLDR: Truly really good class (I just think it's more worth talking about the negatives), but proceed with caution if a) you like to walk away from classes feeling you've learned a lot or b) it's important that you have close control of your grade via the effort you put in.\"",

            "review 4: \"21S with Erik Griffin: Overall, the workload was pretty chill, but the 3 exams (two midterms and a final, each worth 20%) were tricky. Be ready for questions that are bio13 level tricky. The good thing was that class participation was worth 25% of your total grade, so just make sure to speak up once per class and/or go to office hours. I liked how we got to read some empirical papers in this class, and there is a group presentation on a paper of your choice at the end of the term that I think helped boost grades a little. I feel like the topics were a little disjointed, but Griffin is a great prof and genuinely cares about his students. He even gave us more time on the final exam (while keeping the length the same) because he got feedback that students felt crunched for time. The only downside to this class is that the exams are short (only 4 questions), which sucks if one of the questions tests a topic you're not as strong on. So, definitely make sure you have a good understanding of everything covered in-class. Similar to 13, we had to watch ~20-30 minutes of videos before every class, but the exams were more skewed towards things covered synchronously over zoom.\"",

I'm not sure if it was that or me being brand new to the subject or a combination of both but I feared that I had no grasp of what was going on. But then I read the textbook. READ THE TEXTBOOK! It's wonderful to clarify the material! Unit 2 was taught by Professor Turk, who was extremely organized, kind, and helpful. The same goes for Professor Pioli, who taught Unit 3. At this point the lectures were sufficient for me to understand the material and the textbook just acted as a supplement/ study tool. Content wise, the material is fascinating and is prevalent in a lot of the recent scientific literature, so it has helped me in that respect. Difficulty wise, I'd say getting an A is very manageable but not so easy that it wouldn't feel well-deserved.

I didn't think the first unit, which was taught by Dr. Obar, was organized very well and as a result, I didn't have a good understanding of the basics. To be fair, I think it was his first time teaching, so his unit will probably be structured better next year. The material covered was very detailed and included the topics of innate and adaptive immunity, B cells, T cells, types 1-4 hypersensitivity, vaccines, COVID-19 immunology, tumor immunology, and immunotherapies.

Dr. Pioli is a really great lecturer, but her section is so much big topic stuff that sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re supposed to know -but she\u2019s great in office hours so don\u2019t worry.

It would have been nice if Schaller could have tied the material into the bigger picture (organ/organism level) throughout the term instead of only at the end, so we got some sense of relevance.

He is genuinely one of the best professors I have ever had at Dartmouth. He's funny, an amazing lecturer, and is extremely open to answering questions and giving students help both during class and in office hours. And, if you go to office hours, he'll provide questions about the material; often, one or two of these questions will be very similar (or even identical) to a question that he asks on the exams, so he definitely rewards students trying. Overall, this course is really tough. There's 3 midterms and 1 semi-cumulative final (70% new material, 30% old material). There are weekly problem sets that are graded for completion and also 11 pre-lecture videos/quizzes (these quizzes are super super easy - if you watch the pre-lecture video, you'll definitely do well on these). The difficulty with this course is definitely in the pace - at the beginning of the term, it's pretty similar to orgo, but when you get to metabolism (around week 6) it gets EXTREMELY fast paced. This course took up most of my time by the end of this term. Prof Lee's exams are really tough but fair - I disagree with the other reviews that say it's all about memorization because his exams were very application based. You really needed to know the material to be able to answer them. Overall, I found this course very rewarding and I definitely learned a lot, but it was a staggering amount of work.\"",

I would definitely recommend taking the class with him. He has office hours and is responsive to emails; he's also very passionate about Biochem and tells jokes in class.

Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a layup by any means, but the content is comparable in amount to orgo with the notable difference that the professor is not a monster. Professor Lee was perfect; an engaging lecturer, reasonable with expectations and policy, and an incredibly sweet and kind person. He has the most fair and transparent grading policy that i've encountered so far in my stem curriculum (as a bio major premed junior) and i thought how i did in this class was directly proportional to how hard i worked. def recommend taking it with prof lee and in the bio department\"",

The biggest challenge is just how much information there is to learn, but professor Lee does a really good job of explaining all of the concepts you need to understand to do well in the course. I honestly really liked the lectures, prof Lee makes a ton of jokes in class and tries to have fun with the material and he really cares about the students. My only frustration with this class was that the exams were consistently much harder than the practice exams. That being said, he really wants you to succeed and he rewards you for showing that you know something even if its not completely right and gives a TON of partial credit, so even if you don't feel great about an exam you'll be fine. There are three exams and a final, which is a LOT, but professor Lee drops your lowest midterm grade so that there was a bit less stress over each individual exam. We also got a cheat sheet for the third exam and two for the final which was super helpful. Overall this was probably one of my favorite classes I've taken in the bio department because the lectures were entertaining and connected a lot of my other bio and pre-med courses. If you're interested in this class, you should definitely take it with professor Lee.\"",

It is a ton of material packed into a normal Dartmouth term and it's in the Bio department so the exams will be really challenging. With that being said, there is a ton of silver lining to this course and taking it with Dr. Lee. Biochem is interesting because if you're pre-med it finally feels like you are learning things relevant to medicine and all the basic science you have been learning will really come together in this course which was more interesting in my opinion than a class like CHEM05. Also if you're pre-med and you've made it to this point, you've likely made it through the wringer and most of the kids in this class are other pre-meds who are more chill at this point because they have been through it already. Dr. Lee is by far the most genuine and sweet STEM professor I have had at this school. He really cares for his students, he constantly cracks jokes during lectures, and he makes a bunch of resources available to help. This class isn't easy, but Dr. Lee does everything to help students succeed. He is one of the most positive-natured professors I have had at Dartmouth, so if you need to take it in the Bio department or you just want to knock the class out without needing to take the lab like me, you will be in good hands. Truly cannot say enough good things about Dr. Lee. He is so genuine and he grades the exams very carefully and gives a ton of partial credit/allowed re-takes on the last two exams.

I\u2019m kind of shocked to learn he has a bad rap because he\u2019s super nice and this class was very enjoyable and interesting. He is so happy to see you every day, and he tries to make jokes and engage people. He\u2019s a bit awkward, but he\u2019s so so nice. Honestly, in the whole virtual learning mess, it made me happy to see him because he was so happy to teach. Lee can sometimes give a confusing explanation, but like the other review said, just stop and tell him you\u2019re confused. He was available after class and held two office hours per week. He also is good about responding to emails, so you are never left totally confused. You can tell how passionate he is about the subject matter and the students, so you always feel supported. I think that the first two=three lectures might feel weird/confusing, but you just adjust after that and then it\u2019s every fine. His lecture style is just a little more freestyle than usual, so he can accidently confuse you. But overall, I really never struggled to understand what he was saying, and I thought it was all pretty clear. Exams I felt were very fair. Every once in a while, he\u2019ll throw in a question that requires more thought, but with maybe one or two exceptions, I felt they were all very solvable. The only issue with Lee\u2019s exams is time; he told us he was giving us 2 hour exams with a 3 hour block. However, these were hands down 3 hour exams and the final was realistically 4. However, this was a virtual learning issue that won\u2019t carry over to in person classes. I will say that there is probably 3x more material to memorize in biochem than all of orgo. If you were struggling to memorize all the chem 52 reactions, you will deeply struggle in this class. It\u2019s so interesting and you learn so much, but I cannot emphasize how much material you have to know.

Some of his explanations were a little confusing, but he made himself super available outside of class if there was any confusion. He also is so clearly invested in this class and really loves the material, and he tries to throw clicker questions and jokes into the lectures to make them more engaging. The tests were not terrible - some questions were pretty random, but I felt that for the most part, they were fair. One nice thing is that he will drop your lowest midterm score.

Your grade is based off of 6 quizzes (open note, take them on your own time during the weekend), a midterm, and a final. Each quiz consists of 10 questions, which can either be multiple choice or check all that apply. Thus, for the latter type of question it is better to be on the more cautious side because one incorrect option cancels out one correct option. He also doesn't give much practice materials for each exam (only a few problems, maybe like half an exam), so the onus is on you to know both the content and the experimental techniques very well. Witters is very available (he has office hours almost every day), but I found that he can be arrogant/unhelpful outside the lectures. The good thing is that you can demonstrate \"active engagement\" in other ways, like posting questions or answering other people's questions on Slack and talking once or twice per class (I would recommend skimming/reading the papers so you can answer basic questions in-class about what a particular graph or PCR result indicates). Also agree with what the other review said about Witters not answering the question you asked and answering a different question; this was a consistent issue throughout the class. This class was structured such that the second half of a class would be interesting new material and then the first class of the next class would be going over papers related to the content covered in the previous class. He also had x-hours that were dedicated to either problem-solving/case study type questions or guest speakers from doctors (who were alums of the class!). Overall, this was a hard but rewarding class and I recommend it to anyone with even a little interest in endocrinology and/or thinking like a doctor.\"",

Witters makes himself extremely available - he has individual office hours EVERY day of the week and a 1 hour group office hour right before the weekly quizzes are opened in Canvas. The material is quite organized, though he has a habit of not answering the question that is asked of him (i.e. if you ask him a question, he'll answer something else and then get annoyed if you push him - thankfully, if he isn't saying something in class, it's not going to be tested on the exams). The key to success in this class is stay on top of the material and go to office hours once or twice a week. Witters rewards hard work, and his exam/quiz style is really straight forward. You'll learn a lot and the more you put into the class the more you'll get out of it. Highly recommend!\"",

Having run the course many times before, he organizes it very well without seeming bored of teaching the material. He truly cares about each student\u2019s success. He runs a tight ship and most people who take this class are bio majors and pre-meds. But even as a non-major, non-premed, I found things pretty manageable. The quizzes are typical bio exam stuff\u2014really complicated applications of information mentioned once in lecture. But we had two tries per quiz so it wasn\u2019t hard to get almost all of them right as long as you dedicated time to reviewing lectures. The problem sets were very engaging, though a bit tricky. But after the first you get lots of feedback and a detailed answer key, so you get a good sense of how you\u2019re supposed to do them and they get easier over time. Overall, it was a hard but rewarding course, and I feel I learned a lot. If you think you'd be interested in taking a deep dive on endocrinology, I think Witters does very well at that, and anyone can be successful if they put in the work.

Professor Witters is a really dedicated and well-versed instructor, however, I feel the focus of the course was more on the papers than on the lectures. This is perfectly fine, because the papers are of real world applications of the material we learn, but the cost is that the lectures are rushed through extremely fast. He podcasts all his lectures. Thus, towards the latter parts of the course, it becomes virtually impossible to take notes and keep up with the lectures component of a class meeting, so I ended up spending 2 to 3 hours after each class relistening, rewinding, pausing, and jotting notes while listening to the podcasts. Another aspect of the course I found a little disconcerting was the structure of the tests. The bulk of the questions were posed in a clinical/research context in order to test the problem solving abilities of the students. While this is a legitimate teaching technique, the course itself did not explicitly instruct students in-depth about the ramifications of different clinical or research methodologies in the field contexts. The consequence of this is that those students with a research background (having performed these techniques in real life for laboratories) have an unfair advantage because they have a much firmer grasp of the overarching rationales for the techniques. The fact that Bio 23 (Molecular Bio) was not a pre-requisite somewhat entrenches this divide even more.\"",

This is a ton of information, and it would be helpful to take Bio 23 (Molecular Biology), Bio 35 (Animal Physiology), or some other upper level bio course before tackling this course.

We also completed two problem sets (2 pages, single-spaced), one large paper (a review of an endocrine article with outside research - 5-7 pages, double-spaced), and two exams.

We learned some really interesting material on Endocrine diseases. The 'book' is actually a reader of medical research papers written on each disease. Although this makes them more challenging at first, it's also really interesting to learn biology based on mutations that actually affect patients. This class is awesome for anyone planning on going to med school. The class is a 10A and it's fast paced so be prepared but Witters posts his slides so you can take notes directly on the slides. He is always available outside of class and the writing assignment: making a study guide for a medical paper on the topic of your choice was really interesting.

They require rote memorization of a lot of facts, like in the intro courses, versus a real understanding of the systems and the signifigance. If you've taken an intensive bio paper-writing course you may actually be at a disadvantage, as Witter does not want that much information.

At that, the reading isn't too long, but it is important to keep on top of it as it is critical to be able to analyze data and think in the way a medical scientist would during the exams.

I imagine the reverse would be helpful as well (maybe taking 35 before 12 will make it slightly less miserable). Anyway aside from its similarity with 12, the class is just great. You learn very very cool stuff about how the brain is wired, neurons themselves, synaptic transmission, the relevant biology of neurological disorders, and more. Prof Hoppa throws tons of information at you but does so in an organized and completely manageable way.

There were also about 90 minutes of videos to watch each week that were honestly pretty useless and mostly her talking through math you will never need to actually use since the software does it for you and giving long-winded and confusing explanations of simple tests. Toward the end of the term I stopped watching the videos altogether and just read through the filled-in notes she posts with the videos and googled how to use the tests, which was a much more efficient use of time. The software exercises that were due on Monday nights were pretty time-consuming if you actually did the whole thing and not just the part you have to turn in, but they were way more useful than the videos and actually explained how to use the software so I would recommend doing them.

You will learn A TON about how to handle real data and check to make sure assumptions are met before conducting statistical analyses. The quizzes can be tricky in that they often feature edge cases in terms of checking whether data meets the assumptions for a given analysis, and the prof sometimes acknowledged that questions were designed to be tricky/tricks. A lot of prep work goes into each class, but classes themselves are pretty laid back and feature mostly group work that you can do pretty well on if you incorporate feedback into future assignments.

This course is probably optimal for biology majors, as the research project at the end is more rewarding for them, but for individuals interested in the subject material, it's still a good class. Peterson also teaches Bio 6, Dinosaurs, but I have the feeling he's more passionate about this class.\"",

I admit that some pieces of some lectures were fascinating. But on the whole, the material was very dry and detailed, simply for detail's sake. Second, Lambie is hardly the most organized lecturer you'll find around. Indeed, sometimes he starts talking about stuff, and you ask yourself why he's saying what he's saying.

The lectures also did not contain a lot of text and could've used more organization so that one could actually study from them.

The ORC says it's supposed to be interdisciplinary and all that, but the prof, because of his background, teaches mostly from an ecology standpoint (when he ventured into the neurology aspect, I'm not even sure HE knew what he was talking about), and it felt like the neuroscience majors in the class really struggled. Actually, a lot of people in the class seemed to be struggling; I found the explanations of things in lecture to be pretty comprehensible for the most part, but I'm sure others would disagree. It didn't really help that some of the diagrams used in examples of particular concepts were extremely confusing without their captions, and that the prof mostly posted incomplete powerpoints (with blanks still in them) and never updated them (I have no idea if this was on purpose or not). I think the one lecture that was taught by a postdoc in Prof. Calsbeek's lab was probably the clearest lecture in the term for most people. The optional readings felt like they had very little to do with class, the study questions also tended to bring up things I'm pretty sure we barely mentioned (if at all) in class and were rather scary, the \"homework\" were a few random assignments that I'm not sure actually had anything to do with our grades (one of them included writing a haiku, unbelievably enough), etc. The prof is a likable guy who always gave us breaks at the halfway point of lecture, but that doesn't really excuse him being incredibly disorganized. He scheduled the review session for our midterm at a time (right before the x-hour) when a significant proportion of the class had a conflict with other classes, with a lecture during the x-hour ... and then got confused and switched the times for the lecture and the review session around. It was a highly unpleasant surprise walking into x-hour to discover that. He made up for it by turning the last lecture into a review lecture specifically going over this material that quite a few of us had missed, but still. On the other hand, the exams were easier than the vague study questions (one of which did appear) had led us to expect, more concept-based (with examples) instead of heavy on the details. ...Admittedly, a lot of people would probably disagree about the difficulty as well, but I think this had more to do with the material not being taught clearly enough. When the syllabus is just a schedule, you should probably start worrying. (Prof. Calsbeek said that he thought he broke the final grade into 30% lab, 30% the single midterm, and 40% the cumulative final, but this was just off the top of his head.) Oh, and don't expect a curve; the prof is very wary of grade inflation. (One last thing: the prof kind of required us to attend at least one Kramer seminar out of 6 relevant ones during the term, by including a question on the final. I didn't really mind, but some people found it hard to make it to the lectures because of conflicts. The prof was accommodating about this, though.)\"",

He didn't give very many assignments and those that he did, he didn't count because so many people were confused by the questions. The format of his tests is a series of essay type questions which are often unclearly worded and include many parts so it is difficult to get full credit on any question even if you understand the main ideas. I felt that most of the material we were taught I had already learned in vertebrate zoology which I took with him the previous term so that may be a component of my negativity.

If you're a hardcore cell bio person, you might not (in fact, you probably will not) enjoy this class, but I recommend it to anyone and everyone else, *ESPECIALLY* people who love animals. The focus of the course is anatomy and the evolutionary background of vertebrate bodies, and Ryan takes a cladistic approach to it (which makes a lot more sense than the usual sort of organismal or systemic approach used by some). The class itself wasn't particularly hard for me, but I believe that's at least partly because I enjoyed it so much. There weren't any assigned readings, per se, but all of the relevant material could be found in the lectures and slides, which certainly made things easier; the textbook was there if you wanted to use it for supplementary reading, but it was good to know that we didn't *have* to wade through it if we didn't want to. If you aren't passionate about the subject, however, I wouldn't buy it. Exams are a bit tough, but very fair. He can be a hard grader strictly in terms of points, but Ryan really loves seeing his students do well. Ryan brought his dog, a yellow lab named Gus, to class almost every day (such a sweetie!), and it's obvious he truly enjoys the material on which he's lecturing. He has a propensity to go a little fast through the PowerPoint slides, but they're all available off Blackboard, so it's not a big deal. He's definitely the greatest professor all-round that I've ever had at Dartmouth. He's always extremely approachable, and has the most down-to-earth attitude of anyone I've known in this department. His unique brand of humor and zaniness really made the class that much more awesome for me. I lost count of how many YouTube movies we watched (though I remember that only 2 or 3 even related to the material at hand). I probably shouldn't be saying this in case he gets in trouble for it, but at one point, in the heat of demonstrating some physical concept associated with vertebrate locomotion, he chucked an egg full-force at the blackboard. After we got through laughing, there was egg on it for the rest of the term (there may actually still be). As I'm starting to ramble, I'll come to a close. Ryan is the greatest guy ever. If you have a chance to take a class with him, don't pass it up. You won't be disappointed. If you have the chance to take this class, and you don't fall under the contraindicated groups, I strongly urge you not to miss out on the awesomeness that is vert. zoo.\""

It is a lot of work and your grades don't always reflect the amount of time that you put into it. The median for the course is set at about a B. The grading for the course is based on three exams (non-cumulative) and two big lab reports. The lab reports are VERY time consuming but not difficult. The exams are like other biology exams in that you need to memorize a LOT of material and be able to apply it. Professor Bickel gave very organized lectures and was very willing to talk to students. She has an obvious passion for the subject. Overall, I would definitely take this course if you are a biology major or a pre-med student and you know what you are getting yourself into.

The book for this class is basically not necessary.

Grotz is a new professor and has some work to do on her lectures - they weren't very well organized at all but she made huge improvements throughout the term, and one can only expect them to continue getting better with each lecture she teaches... so she'll probably be considerably better by winter 05. The exams were quite tedious to study for considering the huge amount of material and detail this class goes into... but with a bit of effort, all should be fine. The labs were really fun and had a whole lot to do with the course material... though it doesn't really come together until writing the final report. Speaking of which, though very satisfying and informative, the lab report ended up being 35 pages for me, although I know some were able to do it in about 20. In anycase lab is almost the entire four hours every week for 8 weeks and the two reports take a lot of time... but there are only two. I would recommend the course to anyone who has a genuine interest in learning and in learning biology especially... if you're taking it just for fun... I'd say no.\""

It's not that the material is all that tough or that the lectures are all that ineffective. The tests are hard, but they aren't absolute killers.

It could easily have been the previous Thursday or Friday minus one lecture's worth of material or plus one lecture the next Wednesday. But no, the midterm was the Monday directly following Winter Carnival. As such, people had an incredibly difficult time studying and ruined their weekend or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t study at all and bombed the midterm (which was also the hardest one we were given). Remember, that was around 20% of the grade. Further, the timing of the course each day is killer. Why make it at the earliest possible time and call all the X-Hours? It's a popular course - I'm sure another course could be pushed down to this time, and this class could be moved to later in the day. Not only did everybody look absolutely dead every morning (especially Thursdays), but the few people who could make it to class fell asleep regularly.

What you'll need to know for the tests are: processes; chemicals/proteins, etc. and what they do, what will happen if they are present, absent, too much of it, etc.; main points of the sidebars; how to draw chemical structures; keywords (there are fill-in the blank questions, so know them well and in their context); people and what they did, how, etc.; experiments and the details, how it was done, what it proved, names of the people who did it, etc.; how to solve problems like statistics, equations, etc. I didn't do all of these, but everyone realized you have to do all of them to get anywhere in there. And I mean that. EVERY ONE OF THEM. If you're pre-med and fail, take it again. You'll do better the second time and the rest of the pre-meds aren't as hard from what I hear.\"",

            "review 35: \"05W with Edward Berger: ...about this course. But I think that's really just because they haven't had a lot of experience with science classes at Dartmouth yet. As a senior who has taken orgo, biochem, and a couple of other bio courses, I found this course to be pretty simplistic. Most of the information that was covered was on a pretty basic level as one would expect from an intro course, and I actually found myself mentally adding in the details that the professors left out in lectures. I took bio 15 my freshman winter and decided to hold off on bio 16 as long as possible - I think that was a wise decision. If you're premed but not planning on the bio major, wait until after you've had more science courses before tackling this one. The majority of people in the course are always freshmen, and it was funny to study with them and see them panicking about all of the material - most of which I'd already seen in other courses. I took this course both because my major required it as a prereq and also because I thought it would be helpful for the MCATs; i'm studying for them right now, however, and there's barely any genetics so, at least as this course was taught, you really wouldn't need it prior to taking the MCATs. A lot of the other reviews are pretty critical of Lambie; I think it's mostly just bitterness over some of his exam questions. While the exams he wrote were pretty tricky, they really weren't as bad as a lot of people are making them out to be - unless you've never seen any of the material before, which is why I recommend waiting to take this course. Lambie's lectures were paced incredibly slowly - and it seemed he went over everything in such detail that it was easy to pull out what was important and what would be on the exam. HOWEVER, if you didn't make it to one of his lectures, it was tough to study because he didn't post lecture notes on Blackboard nor make them available in any other way; further some of his material wasn't in the book, so lecture attendance really is a must. Berger's lectures were kind of fragmented and he seemed to get confused about little things and mumble. He also had a tendency to say \"oh it's this way, not this way, oh no, I was right the first time\" so I found parts of his lectures to be difficult to understand. However, he provided excellent lecture notes on Blackboard, which made it really easy to study for his exams. Both professors had some really inane questions on the exams - fill in the blank types which pretty much required rote memorization. Since I didn't really study for this course, I think I'd generally get about 2 out of 10 on those, so if you want to ace the exams, you've actually got to know this little things, like what type of bacteria a certain experiment used. Otherwise, exams weren't bad. I averaged about 4 hours of studying before each of them, so I didn't do as well as I would have liked, but if you devote more time than I did to the course (or buy a copy of the textbook, for example) you should be just fine. If you're not a freshman.\"",

Professors tell you that this class isn't designed to weed students out of the major, but it obviously is.

It's also discouraging to study for hours and hours and feel like you're starting to gain understanding, and still do much worse than expected on the test (although this was usually ok, since the medians were so low). Professor Jack's lectures were comprehensible and he was very good at explaining the material. Dolph's lectures were all over the place and very hard to follow.

Prof Pries is really passionate about the content, is willing to help you during office hours, and is overall a good lecturer. She is a tough but fair grader--she luckily does entertain grade-disputes, which was very necessary as the TA's often mess stuff up on grading exams. Lab makes the class a lot of fun, as the content of ecology was really entertaining. All though, lab grading was often very picky--I recommend going to Craig the lab director if you need something fixed. Craig made and prepared all of the labs while the TA's teach them, but Craig really is one of the best parts of the class. Exams are hard and a time crunch but as mentioned Pries allows you to argue the grading on a lot of stuff. Grading came out to be 70% dependent on class stuff: 15% participation, 45% midterm exams, 35% for the final, and 5% on an ecology meme, combined with a 30% dependent on lab grades.

Go to office hours or Pine w/ her if you can. Exam grading was kinda funky, but we switched over to gradescope mid-term which helped standardize things. Still, there were a few questions that I had to defend in office hours because the TA's graded them weird. Labs were time-consuming - 4 hrs a week - but generally fun, and Craig is just super entertaining to be around. Try not to get him on a tangent though or you'll be in lab for an extra 30 minutes. Workload: Readings - 30 min/class. Not always necessary but helpful for cementing understanding. Honestly I found it more useful to do them after the relevant class rather than before Ecosystem notebooks - 2-4 hours / every other week. short ish blog-style post about concepts discussed in class applied to an ecosystem of choice (choose an easy one with a lot of studies done - I did the Tundra and there was a lot of busywork just finding articles). primary lit worksheet - .5-1hr/wk. read an article, summarize the findings, identify confusing terms etc. pretty simple and quick Lab reports - one four page paper, two short graph summaries, and a presentation made and given during the 4 hour time slot. grading for these is typically pretty soft. Exams - 2 x 1hr midterms, 1x 2hr final. Tough, all short answer. know the main graphical models and big concepts, but also pay attention to examples given in class- they can show up and trip you up.

Lectures were often broken up with group activities to help us work through the material, although we never had to formally turn in group work. You can tell Caitlin is extremely passionate about what she does and is a relatively engaging lecturer who's always willing to answer questions. On top of readings, we also had four ecosystem notebook entries throughout the term, each of which was more work than the last. There were two non-cumulative midterms and a cumulative final, which I found surprisingly difficult (I think the median on our first midterm was in the mid-70s). The lab is a big time commitment (four hours a week) but is generally pretty interesting and Craig, the lab instructor, keeps things entertaining--he even brought us homemade apple cider one day.

Professor Pries is very obviously passionate about the material which, of course, makes the class more interesting. I disliked the lab portion but that was really just because of zoom. We mostly just copied data collected by previous students into JMP and excel, which wasn't all too exciting. I'm sure that in regular times it's much more fulfilling. I recommend that students who are drawn to this class because of the lab aspect (being in the field to collect data and such) wait to take this course until corona has settled a bit and in-person classes resume.

You get to go outside to the O-Farm and other forested areas for labs, and my lab group bonded and had a lot of fun. The lecture is softened with group activities on white boards and with Prof. Pries' fun and genuine personality and love for ecology. The midterms and final are kind of hard, but I found most of the material very interesting and it really got me thinking like a scientist and an ecologist. This class is really worth your time.\""

            "review 6: \"02S with Patrick Dolph: Dolph and McClung both taught this class. Dolph, although monotone, was at least fairly easy to follow along. I wish I could say the same thing for McClung. But I can't. McClung, although a very approachable prof, failed to explain concepts well. Furthermore, his style of lecture might as well be given to students taking the course for the second time; he assumes that the students are already somewhat of genetic experts and therefore treats the class as a Cliff Notes review. Neither professor was particularly interesting or boring. The material itself had the potential to be really fun and interesting. I really wish it had been taught better. I kept on having the feeling (and I was not the only one) that the course was poorly organized/constructed. I did learn, but it was namely from my own studying (along with severe panicking for the exams). If you think you understood the concept, the tests proved you wrong. Some questions forced you to recall absurdly specific details which had little relevance to the rest of the material as a whole. These were the questions you actually looked forward to. Other questions had built-in curve balls that seemed impossible for first-time genetics students to even approach. The problem sets are extremely useful; unfortunately, they're scarce. Exam problems are NOT reflective of book problems, so you're forced to wait for the profs to send out a practice problem set and a sample exam. There is only so much you can do with so little, and since the class is bell-curved, this basically makes for an interesting distribution of grades. In my opinion, it was unfair to be given so few problems for practice and then be expected to master problem types (and their deviants) given only one or two examples. The textbook was god-awful. There was too much information that wasn't relevant to exam material, and the book itself failed to explain anything well. I constantly found myself asking other students for explanations, and at one point was in hysterics because my hours of effort were failing to yield dividends. The median is set at a B-, like many other pre-req science courses, which does little to alleviate the pressure and frustration. The only redeeming factor for this class is that it's over. Unfortunately, the grade stands. So frustrating was this class that for study breaks, I studied chemistry.\"",

This class definitely has a math element, but the difficulty stems from \"which of these 30 similar formulas should I use for this question?\". My biggest recommendation for being successful in this class is that for every time a new formula comes up, write it down, and write down the situation in which that formula is useful. Also ask lots of questions to Prof Z about when to use each formula, because sometimes it's very confusing.

He always tried to tie in his research into the lectures, and was no help at all in office hours. I went into his office several times with lists of questions and he would answer them with as few words as possible and look at me like I was wasting this time.

Professor: Velez is very funny and an engaging lecturer, but he has difficulty explaining the material to the class. Several times, he taught us the wrong thing one day, and the next day, had to go back and apologize and try to explain it again. His examples are very specific and not out of the textbook, and you will be expected to know them. Workload: Make sure you read the text and go to class. You won't understand one without the other, and questions from both will be on the exams. Speaking of exams, all three (yes, three) midterms and the final are doozies.

He has a pretty heavy Spanish accent but, unless you have a really hard time with accents, it should pose no problem. The class itself is extremely interesting. Velez uses plenty of interesting and unusual animal examples in order to survey each organ system before he goes through it, which keeps you engaged. He really knows his stuff and has a knack for explaining things that you had learned in previous bio classes but never truly understood All of this being said, the exams were not easy. This class should not be treated like any other class. The readings should be done ahead of time and the material should be studied thoroughly. There are three midterms and one gets dropped and your worst sections on the test also get dropped, which helps, but to compensate, there is no curve. An A requires a 93 or higher and so on. The exams require a very comprehensive knowledge of the material but if you pay attention and do the reading you should be fine In sum, an excellent class, and excellent professor, and exams that can be quite fun if you study well....or absolute hell if you dont\"",

He was always eager to answer questions in class, but the thing is, he went so quickly through the material that at times it was physically impossible to take notes fast enough to keep up... unless you can write at eye-blurring speed. The podcats are available afterwards, though. I learnt a lot in this course, but I think I would have got a much better grade if I hadn't taken it during freshman year. If, like me, you are a Bio major who has to take three of the 12-16 courses, then I would strongly suggest NOT taking this as your frist Bio class at Dartmouth apart from Bio 11! That's what I did, and I regret it. The material is hard and there's a lot to learn. A lot of the time the prof and the TAs assumed we had background in the subject... if you are learning all this for the first time, then you will feel lost. Plus the premeds are really annoying if you happen to be a Bio major like me and are genuinely interested in biology for its own sake. Most of the students are upperclassmen and women, and not much of the material seems new to them, so I guess that's why Prof Velez moved through it so quickly. Trust me, get some other classes done before taking this one, or you'll suddenly find yourself expected to memorize a complex diagram on every single slide and to write two research papers without any feedback even if you have never written one before.\"",

The professor is completely clueless; the \"class,\" if you can call it that, is not graded on a curve, yet the average grades for the exams were around a C. Also, his lectures are a joke, and while his accent is somewhat entertaining at first, it gets to be extremely annoying after the first 5 minutes. The class itself was all about memorizing a ridiculous amount of stupid, useless facts that weren't really even organized into a coherent lesson plan. Let me make it clear that you don't actually learn anything in this class, nor are you intellectually stimulated in any way, shape, or form. The test format was possibly the stupidest thing I have ever seen. The multiple-choice questions could have anywhere from 0-4 correct answers, and you actually lost points for each wrong answer selected, as well as each correct answer not selected. Basically, the tests were just designed to trick you as much as possible. Even if you know all the material, most of the questions are worded in a way that makes them wide open to interpretation, and he's not there during exams to answer any questions. In the end, it becomes a mind game to try and guess what Velez wants you to put, and then put the opposite of that. So instead of actually being tested on the material, we were tested on how well we could read Velez's mind. I think Velez even admits as much, with his smug, unsympathetic attitude, which is just disgusting. It's classes like these that make me question the point of college. I've had classes before that I didn't get much out of, but at least the teacher actually made an attempt to inspire some interest in the subject or to make it seem like we weren't wasting a good 1/240 of our lives.

The way 2 hours feels like 5 is just pain-staking. This class is so mind-numbing, and truly, the unnecessary focus on the most minute, insignificant details for the tests is astounding. The tests are based purely on memorization and regurgitation of information. The rubrics for grading on the tests are absolutely ridiculous. For the short answer questions, they expect you to literally say every single thing you possibly can. Don\u2019t believe them when it says to briefly describe something. Just say EVERYTHING you know. Memorize EVERYTHING. For multiple choice questions, they will sometimes ask you about things that you did not even learn in class, which is the definition of unfair and frankly, is the embodiment of academic misconduct. How can we be expected to answer something that we didn\u2019t even learn about in class? Some of them are not closely related to the material we learned in class. You would only be able to correctly answer the question by guessing or from taking previous bio classes here from which you\u2019d learn that information.

Calsbeek is a funny lecturer and I genuinely enjoyed going to class and hearing his anectdotes about lizards, frogs, and seals (SO MANY SEALS). The lab section was 6 labs spread over the term and they were (for the most part) very fun and cool. We got to dissect lots of things like cow eyes, pig hearts, sheep lungs, and more which was really fun. The lab reports were less fun, primarily because it seemed like the TAs expected you to know exactly how to write one without really teaching us at all (maybe this experience was unique to me, I just have never had to write a lab report before in high school). There were three tests and they were honestly brutal. I studied soooooo hard for these tests and they all came back as 80s. Tests would place stupidly high weight on what was said in like the bottom corner of a slide in tiny text that Calsbeek glossed over. It feels like there is no way to get an A on the tests, but again, it is my first term.

Especially compared to BIOL 12, BIOL 13 is much more focused on critical thinking and problem-solving versus memorization. The class is challenging, but office hours with Dolph are extremely helpful and the in-class problems indicate the type of problem on the test. It is in a flipped format with at most 40 minutes of lecture per class, and in-class work is just group problem solving. Lab is worth 10% and there are 4 exams. It's a hard but very good class.\"",

Professor Dolph is honestly one of the best professors I've had at explaining concepts in college. The course is in a flipped format, with take home lectures and extra problems, and then a short lecture and group-based practice problems in class, which was very fitting for this sort of a course, where it is really just a lot of problem solving in a genetics framework (not math heavy if you're worried about that, but it feels like if a math word problem had no numbers.) I can imagine that that would be difficult if you had a lackluster TA or group, but I personally got very lucky in both departments and learned a lot in class. There were 3 midterms, one of which was week 9, and a final, all of which were challenging but very fair, and were similar enough to the practice exams he would post the week before. Grades were almost always back within a week, or just a bit more. There is a lab, and it is worth 10% of the grade. Overall, very good experience as my first bio course.\"",

Miranda (I think now Tanner is the TA) is a GOD in this class and you absolutely have to go to those review sessions and learn those problems inside and out. This is one of my favorite courses I've taken here, unexpectedly so because I expected it to just be another pre-med requirement. Amodeo sometimes got turned around and contradicted herself and Dolph had to correct her which was sometimes awkward. The 3 (!) midterms and final allowed us to bring a double-sided (could be typed!) cheat sheet which was nice, so there was no memorization involved, just problem solving. Highly recommend Dolph, and Amodeo might get better at it with time.\"",

It's a foundation course so expect to put in a fair amount of work and probably get a B but I thought it was way more enjoyable and manageable than 19 or 14. The videos are clear and not excessively long. You get to bring a cheat sheet to every exam so you don't need to memorize much, and the exams are more about problem solving than remembering every small detail mentioned once in lecture. Dolph gave the majority of the lectures and is a clear and entertaining lecturer, Amodeo is not bad either. Exams were challenging but fair and there are 4 of them so if you bomb one it's not the end of the world.

If you just think you're \"interested in genetics\"... maybe reconsider. This class is a huge time suck. We had 4 exams including the final. First exam was Monday of week 3 (!), then every exam after that was a 3-hour exam in the evening. The weekend before exams, I would spend both days doing practice problems until I felt comfortable with the problem-solving that would be asked of me, and even then, some of the test questions would be completely foreign to me. After the test, you're allowed to redo any problems you thought you got points off on, but you will get very little (if any) credit back, and this also takes a couple hours. Given, I did get a pretty good grade in this class, but I'm not sure the time commitment was worth it. (This is coming from someone who barely studied for Bio 12 exams and felt fine on them.) That being said, I did really enjoy this class. Dolph is a really good lecturer, although most of that happens outside of class (flipped classroom / video lectures), and in class you do group problems. The group problems were super helpful in reinforcing my understanding of the material, and even though my class was pretty large (70-ish people), it seemed like by the end, Dolph knew all of us. He made a point of interacting with individual groups during class, and each group had an assigned LF (John Rossi is a g). The content is super interesting, and Dolph does a great job of explaining it. His emails are strangely curt, but he's always available and very accommodating should you have questions or need an exam moved - and just a nice guy, really. So basically, well-taught, well-run class, but exam prep takes forever and is exhausting (if you want to get a B, expect to spend a solid day or so studying).\"",
            "review 6: \"20W with Patrick Dolph: This class was interesting to me and kind of fun because it involved a lot of logic and problem solving. That said, the tests were brutal. He had to give us extra time on the midterms (meaning that we were at the LSC for at least 3.5 hrs, until 10:30pm). He is a really nice guy but some of his problems were impossible. No matter how much you studied, you could've easily scored below median. Still, go to the review sessions and do as many problems as you can. One thing that was really nice was that lab usually took only 2 hrs, and post lab was done in lab. However, there were two \"lab summary assignments\" that took forever and were really annoying to do. Work with TAs on this!!\"",
            "review 7: \"20W with Patrick Dolph: Bio13 isn't the hardest class ever. If you make the cheat sheets earlier as you do the lessons, take really good notes on the lectures that you ACTIVELY review (flashcard style), and do all the practice problems from class, review sessions, and exam practice, you will KNOW the material super well. The problem is obviously the exams. My honest to God biggest advice for this class is 1) study early and 2) GET GOOD SLEEP. You need to THINK for those damn exams, like it is imperative that you don't get tired (even though the exams are at 7pm oof). Don't worry too much about the grading; the range for a B is humongous below the median line. Also, the 4 midterms are all really stressful, but you're allowed biff one of them and be fine (I did median for one and still got a good grade). The second and third tests were way harder than the first one and the final for our class, even though the medians were all relatively high (an 85 for the 2nd and I think around a 73 for the third). Also, heads up, Miranda is GOD in this course. Like, Dolph is super helpful and nice, but GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS and ASK QUESTIONS.\"",
            "review 8: \"20W with Patrick Dolph: As a bio major, I really enjoyed this class. Genetics is probably the most difficult foundation course I've taken, simply because it truly is a problem solving course, which I had never experienced before. I really liked Dolph as a prof; he's very approachable, nice, and really wants everyone to understand what's going on. Most of the lectures are done outside of class, which turned out to be pretty fun since in class time was spent on problems. That being said, videos and reading can take up about 1.5 hours for each class if you want good notes. The in class problems were easier than what you would find on the exam, but they really gave you an idea of how to think and what 'problem solving' really means in a biology course. I've seen a few reviews on here saying that the tests were unfair . I'm going to have to disagree (tbh, they are kind of brutal). With the exception of a few problems (yes, there were a few exam questions where I was like this is rude, particularly midterm 2), all of the exam problems were solvable and based on things we'd learned. By no means were these easy exams, but if you had a really good understanding of the concepts, you could work through every single one of them (except maybe like 3). They didn't purposely try to make you mess up or make such a far stretch that you didn't have the means to solve it. Yes, there was a huge step up between midterm 1 and 2 (and they overdid it a bit on #2), but the material got more complex during that time. During the exams, I sometimes felt like a problem was super confusing or totally unsolvable. After the exams, when I discovered I had missed a problem, I often felt like \"What was I thinking?\" Exams were given extra time, but I don't think that was because the problems were so awful (except for exam 2. There was one question on exam 2 that really did a number on everyone). Exams usually had 9 questions, and I just think that was too many for a three hour block. 8 problems easily fit into our 3 hour final block. 9 was just too many. In conclusion, these are hard exams. They will require all of your brain power, but they are not impossible. They will challenge you to really understand and apply what you've learned, and they will test your ability to think critically. This class is going to require time and dedication to doing as many problems as you can. Honestly, my biggest complaint about this class is lab. I've never hated a bio lab as much as I hate genetics lab. Grading was picky and the assignments were boring and completely useless. Also, the 'lab reports' (more like long worksheets) were so long and were actually impossible to do without the help of a TA.\"",

The class was really fast paced, with 3 midterms and a cumulative final (some of the midterms were 3.5 hours and left us scratching our heads in the LSC until 10:30 pm). Some of the midterms were pretty unfair - you can study the practice problems as much as you can but still be absolutely stumped on the exam with a question that doesn't seem to make any sense. They let you do retakes to get some points back, but this class is really about knowing the material well and thinking on your toes.\"",

This flipped-class structure was fine, but sometimes the in-class lectures would be a little redundant, and working on problems could be exhausting some days. During the first week, you are put into a group of 4-5 people that you sit with for the rest of the term. This is helpful for meeting new people and creating study groups. Exams are 3 midterms and 1 cumulative final: these were all pretty tricky but medians were high for all of them.

You either run the gauntlet or forego this course and study genetics on your own for the MCAT. We had two Lab Summary Assignments of about ~10pgs each due over a week, and the first one required us to do *substantial* reflection on Labs 1-5, while the second one was much easier and took us maybe 1/10 the time. Studied maybe 7-9hrs a day and it never felt like enough. Here's a tip if you have an iPad: have 1/4 of your screen with the answer sheets from the Canvas page, and the other with Miranda's practice problems imported into GoodNotes. Repeat Miranda's problems until you have them MEMORIZED. COLD. Also, attend all of Miranda's office hours\u2014she's a legend. I studied like mad hell and had a B all the way up to the final exam, which was strangely FAR easier and pulled it up to a B+. The median for 21W was officially a B. Looking back, though, I'm so glad I took it. I'm sure you will, too :)\"",

While it's hard, it's by no means impossible if you put in a ton (more than you'd expect) effort into the course. We had lecture videos before every class and they ranged between around 7 minutes to over an hour, so make sure you stay on top of those! I would highly recommend taking DETAILED notes on the lecture videos because they give you a deep explanation of the content. It's expected that you understand all the information from the lecture videos before going to class the next day. It's crucial that you know the content to make sure that you're getting the most out of the in-class problems. There were days when I was a little behind on the content and it was a pain in the ass since I always felt like I understood that content less until studying for the exam. Studying for exams was mildly painful; I would go through every problem they provided us (every practice problem, in class problems, TSF problems) until I got every one right. The exams were hard but there was never a problem (with the exception of one on the final) that I genuinely thought I couldn't solve. The class was co-taught by Professor Griffin and Professor Amodeo. I really liked both of them. Professor Griffin was very clear but tends to speak kind of slowly. Professor Amodeo is really fun and excited by the material. Both professors were obviously passionate about genetics, but Professor Amodeo seemed really accessible! The labs were kind of annoying and were really just checking to see how well you read the lab materials, but they may be better in-person. The lab summary assignments had picky grading and basically forced you to go to office hours. They took multiple days to complete and were probably one of the most stressful parts of the class. The TSF, Miranda, was amazing and so helpful! She had review sessions twice a week and she held her own office hours if students ever wanted to ask clarifying questions. The LFs were really great and the structure of the class kept me interested. I would recommend taking this class along with a complete layup and another moderately easy class since you have to study a lot to do well. If you do the work, you'll definitely do amazing!\"",

You just watch pre-lecture videos before every class and then work on problems with your group during class. The profs do almost nothing to help you understand how to figure out the problem sets. The LFs and TSF Miranda should be getting paid more than the profs. HONESTLY, I don't know how the College justifies paying these professors a salary. This class aims for a B median, so the tests are super hard and sometimes, really far away from what you learned in class. The grading on the tests is also really unfair. Sometimes, you can lose more points on a question than it\u2019s worth (how is that even possible???) if you put the incorrect answer. I also feel like I learned nothing in this class. You just learn how to solve problems and practice this technical crap so you can score decent on the exams, but you\u2019re so focused on staying above the median in this class that you don\u2019t end up actually learning anything. Also, because this class is curved to a B median, you constantly and actively hope your classmates do worse than you on the exam and that just isn\u2019t healthy and conducive to learning. Labs were easy online, but the Lab Summary Assignments were just a complete waste of time. If you take this class, go to Miranda\u2019s review sessions and schedule one-on-ones with her. She\u2019s an absolute goddess. Without her, I would\u2019ve done so bad on the tests. I felt like I learned more from Miranda than I did the actual professors cause she explains things so well.

Professor Griffin was a fine lecturer - he explained concepts very clearly and sometimes I found that he talked too slowly so I watched the videos at 1.5 speed. The class was flipped so you had to watch the videos before coming to class and the videos were not evenly distributed. Some days there was an hour of pre-class videos to watch while other days there were only 8 minute-long video. Also the labs were a waste of time, especially the 2 lab summaries that took 3-4 hours to do. Nothing you learn in lab gets tested on during the exam and the lab just eats up time you could spend doing other stuff. Another issue I had with the class were the exams. Since this class is supposed to have a B median, Dolph and Griffin did everything they could to make exam 2 and 3 harder after the class average on the first exam was too high for their liking. So during the course, it felt like no matter how much you knew, you would always fail on the exams. The one good thing about the exams was you were allowed to have a cheatsheet and put whatever you wanted on it although I found that the cheatsheet wasn't that helpful. I did not use my cheatsheet a lot during the exams, maybe for only 1 or 2 concepts. Also our teaching fellow, Miranda Grieg, was an absolute godsend. Her review sessions and weekly lecture summaries were really helpful. What was not helpful/a waste of your time was reading the textbook and doing the book problems. Don't do them. Redo the problems that you see in class and during review sessions instead. In conclusion, don't take this class unless you have to and if you have to, take it during the summer when it's way easier.\"",

The tests then have multi step problems which can result in huge point losses if you can not start the problem correctly. This is particularly annoying with inheritance problems which can really screw you over if you misread something or start with the wrong cross. The first test is worth 10%, the second is worth 15%, and the last two are worth 25% each. Lab is lab. You get to work with flies and find mutations. It's just a disproportionate amount of work that accounts for 10% of your overall grade. There is a group project where you design an inheritance problem. It's not hard and can be somewhat enjoyable if you have a fun group. Generally, it's just a waste of time in my opinion. It's worth 4% of your grade. There is also a literature project where you have to read a paper and present it to a few other classmates. It's worth 4%. This project was enjoyable but was poorly timed as it takes place at the end of the term right before the final. The rest of your grade comes down to participation which is determined by you doing the pre lecture material and submitting the \"quiz\" (you can take it multiple times and it has the answers at the bottom of the page). Your group (which you are assigned to at the beginning) also determines part of your participation grade by submitting a survey about how well you worked with them throughout the term.

I personally enjoyed the pre-recorded lectures that Jack gave us and didn't find them too dry (although I did speed them up sometimes). The flipped classroom gave me a lot of anxiety, but also kept me on top of my game and helped me improve my speaking skills and confidence. The exams were very reasonable; the only complaint I had was that I would have enjoyed more time on them, but giving more time often facilitates cheating so I understand making students a little pressed for time (3 hour and 15 min exams), curving the resulting grades up, and avoiding the increased chance of cheating. To prepare, I did every single question that was assigned, reviewed the material on the weekends, and did more practice problems up until the test, and I think that alone served me well. The tests aren't written in the most clear way, so I would suggest also being careful of how you read things so you don't miss stupid points that would make the difference between a -X and X grade. Basically, cover all your bases and you should be able to survive.

We've yet to get grades returned for the third midterm, which was overall a very fair test and also we had substantially more time to work on it. The virtual lab section for this course was easy. I'm not sure how to express my overall feelings about the class.

But from my experience, exams in this class are far and away the most difficult exams I've ever taken. There a T/F section at the beginning of the first two exams (not the third, which are all problems), and then a few multi-step questions that are worth a TON of points. The first exam was a reasonable median (although I scored under it because I lost all the points on one section because I misinterpreted a diagram), the second exam had a median of 58% (!!), and the third exam had a median in the 80s. That second exam was the most frustrating thing I've had to deal with at Dartmouth. Simply not enough time, MANY students couldn't finish the exam. I didn't completely finish a question, and rushed another one to submit it on time. Also, many classes (most math classes, BIOL 11) have a test grading policy where in multi-step questions, if you answer an early step wrong, but use that information correctly in further steps, you get full credit for the further steps. Not in this class. If you even get the first step slightly wrong, say goodbye to a MASSIVE number of points in that problem. Jack's video lectures are a little lackluster too. I actually liked Prof Jack a lot, but my god, his lecture videos sound like bad ASMR. Very dry, nothing particularly engaging, he's basically whispering into the mic, and watching them felt like a chore. OVERALL THOUGH, aside from my thoughts about the video lectures and the exams, I found a lot of the content to be fascinating. Most of the stuff we learned really gripped me as a learner, and that was great, but the soul-crushing exams admittedly took away some of the joy of learning. Oh well though, it's a BIOL foundation course, these are notorious for their difficulty. A lot of people hated the flipped classroom structure (usually video lectures outside of class, and then clarification/group problem solving in class), but I found the practice problems to be generally helpful, and my group had really good chemistry. The online lab was extremely easy, and the TAs I had were really helpful and nice. The research paper at the end, as well as the group project (where we wrote our own creative inheritance problem) were pretty straightforward and, dare I say it, fun. IN CONCLUSION: know what you're getting yourself into when you take this class. Take two layups alongside it if you can, or at the very least, one VERY EASY course in conjunction. I'm probably going to finish this class with a B+/A- after pouring an obscene number of hours into this class. Godspeed, fellow premeds/bio majors, I believe in you.\"",

In office hours, Professor Lambie is very responsive towards students and enjoys answering questions. While I am not a major or minor in Bio, some of the modern topics we covered were quite interesting and definitely inspired interest in the subject. The second midterm was where things really took a drastic turn. We are normally allotted three hours to take the exam on Monday evenings (from 7:00-10:00pm), but I was there until 11:20 pm, along with 3/4 of the class. The second exam was so difficult that the graduate TAs even said they had never seen a genetics test that difficult before. The final, while a lot easier than the second exam, proved to be quite challenging as well. If you have the flexibility in your D-plan to take Genetics another term, then I would suggest doing so. However, if you must take genetics in the winter then be prepared to put in a significant amount of time to learning genetics and trying your best to tackle Lambie's exams. Make no mistake, his second midterm was one of the most challenging tests I have taken at Dartmouth College and that is no exaggeration in the slightest. I had to use every ounce of ingenuity and knowledge that I had just to scrape a few points above the median. The median was quite low so the exam doesn't quite hurt as much as one might think. That being said, I'm not really sure if any amount of studying could've possibly improved my performance on that exam. The extensions that you had to make from the material learned in class were light years beyond what we were taught, even though I had worked through every problem set and a fair number of the book problems in order to prepare, and being fairly proficient in genetics already. In closing, I would once again suggest that if you can avoid taking this class you should definitely do so. Putting in time and hard work in this class won't necessarily pay dividends, which can be quite frustrating, but you can avoid this and take another term where the level of difficulty is more representative of the other intro bio courses. However, if you must take it it's not the end of the world.\"",
            "review 4: \"09W with Eric J.: The material itself was very interesting. Unfortunately, Lambie tends to design the tests to be interesting for him, meaning that he has to spend some time thinking about the problems before he can come up with an answer. This basically results in tests that are monstrously difficult. In particular, the second exam was terrible because it featured quantitative analysis, which we got almost no instructions on. Specifically, the book contained no problems at the difficulty level that he wanted, so we had to study from two problem sets that he gave us (he did not make them himself because he is too lazy to make any problem sets or practice exams; he just re-uses old ones.) These two problem sets were relatively unclear because they featured no general method of solving the problem. So most of the students were SOL when he handed out the second test, which was at a higher difficulty level than the problem sets. If you take this course with Lambie, be prepared to go to office hours very frequently, and really try to figure out the quantitative analysis section at a higher level than what he gives you. Also, although his lectures can be boring, you MUST STAY AWAKE because he will put up a ridiculous diagram on the board and then say \"I only want you to know such and such,\" which will show up on the exam.\"",

If I hadn't bombed the first test like an idiot, my grade would have been in the A range due to the sheer absurdity of the curve (and believe me I don't care about grades). If you know someone who took this class this term, you'll hear about these tests. He does the (what I feel is morally wrong) \"take material to the next level\" theory on exams, and basically forces you to bridge connections that you've never learned about/how to do on two or several concepts he covered in class. If I didn't read the textbook, I wouldn't have learned ANYTHING about genetics at all, not even the basic stuff. The class became centered on how to do well on the exam rather than how to learn genetics in an introductory class.\"",

The prof is really a nice guy if you meet outside of class, and is funny during lectures (he makes nerdy jokes) but he was very disorganized in his lecture notes and seemed to not be up to date with the class. He gave us problem sets and practice exams recycled from previous years that were unlike the actual tests he gave. Our 2nd exam was the worst because everyone went overtime until midnight--that was a 7-hour exam. Bio13 is a must if you're premed or biology major, but don't take it with this prof.\""

Prof. Gladfelter gives good lectures but you might not be able to keep up because of how fast she goes. She also has office hours that are generally crowded, so that it's hard to ask your questions.

The bad thing about this course is that the exams are ridiculously hard. They're very comprehensive, detailed, and experimental-scenario-based, so that you may run out of time to answer all the questions, and you spend a lot more time than you should reading the questions instead of answering the questions. Also she gives hardly any space for your answers, and then takes off points when your answer isn't thorough enough. This became really annoying after the second test.

His lectures can be boring if you're not interested in the content, but Sloboda has been teaching this class for a very long time, so he explains concepts very well. To succeed in this course, you just need to put the time in. Rewriting notes, typing them up, drawing diagrams, going to Q&As and review sessions, office hours, study groups.

            "review 13: \"07F with Roger Sloboda: Professor Sloboda, although enthusiastic about biology, is not the kind of professor you want to teach your intro biology course. He overemphasizes his favorite parts of biology and digresses during lectures. He was not particularly receptive to questions and in fact expressed disdain about people coming to ask him questions during office hours. I suspect this was partly due to the annoyance of nagging premeds, but nonetheless a professor teaching an intro course should be prepared to have to answer the same question over and over again for five different people. The lectures were decent but at times I felt that the class was going too fast and that the wrong things were being emphasized. This was especially true from lectures 20-30 when he raced through the material. When I went back and looked at the slides I had trouble figuring out which parts of which diagrams were important. In other words, the lectures did not clarify the degree of complexity to which we had to understand the biology for the exams. The exams were undoubtedly the worst part of the class. Although they did test knowledge of the class material, the exams were less about knowing the material and more about knowing what Professor Sloboda was thinking when he wrote his vague questions. The people who did well in the class were not necessarily those who knew the material best. My suggestion is, take this as a fourth class, and if you do poorly on the first exam, drop out and take it some other time with Professor Gladfelter because if you do poorly on the first exam, you won't be doing better on the later ones. Also, the textbook was completely worthless. I read the first chapter before classes started and since then have not touched the book once. I studied purely from the lecture slides and notes I jotted down.\"",

I think the wrong things were emphasized, and it was unclear what we should strive to understand in our studying for the exams. The exams themselves were an unfair assessment of the class material. The questions were ambiguous, unclear, poorly written and designed, and graded arbitrarily. The exams did NOT test one's knowledge of the course material. One's performance on the exam did not directly correlate to the amount of hours studied, or the effort put into the class. Also, the textbook chosen by the professor was irrelevant to the course, and was at much too high of a level for an intro course. The professor admitted to only selecting it because it had \"scale, pretty diagrams.\" Fancy computer diagrams are no reason to select a textbook. As a result, the book was a completely useless resource, and did not reinforce the course material at all. Professor Sloboda gives disorganized and slightly erratic lectures. He does not make it clear which parts of the lecture are the most important, and he often emphasizes the wrong details. He is also not very good at writing exams. I think he has all the right ideas, for example, wanting to make the class interesting, and not all about memorization, but he has all the wrong implementation, for example, the roommate jokes, and the ambiguous exam questions. I would recommend NOT taking this class, or any other for that matter, with Professor Sloboda. He is a nice guy, surely, and knows his biology, but he is NOT an effective teacher. Also, unless you happen to be especially gifted at understanding what he is thinking in his sick, twisted brain, you will probably do poorly on his exams. If you need to take this class, wait until it is taught by the regular prof again. This class was so bad that it made me decide to change my major from Biology to something else.\""

He was always engaging and cracking jokes throughout class, and he really made himself available for extra help (he held two office hours a week, one in person and one virtual, and he held review sessions before exams). We had two midterms and a non-cumulative final. The exams were definitely tricky, but if you studied the lecture material (A LOT), you could do well. Bio12 definitely requires A TON of time if you want to do well, so be prepared for that. Schaller never gave any homework though, so most of my time was just spent reviewing the material on my own or with friends. You only had to know what was discussed in lecture (you were never tested on anything extra from the textbook), so you don't have to read the textbook ever. He did test us on some scientific papers on every exam, which I didn't love. We went over the papers before the midterms, but for the final, he gave us a really difficult paper ahead of time that we were tested on and we weren't allowed to ask him any questions about it or go over it with Miranda (TSF) or TAs. Other than that, though, I recommend taking this class with Schaller! He has a strong biochem background so he is definitely very different from the other Bio12 profs, but I personally liked it that way.

Since there are no assignments outside of the 3 exams, it is very hard to keep up with the material throughout. I always just started studying (really memorizing) the 7-10 lectures four days ahead of the exam date. He made this very easy to do since he provided his own lecture notes and powerpoints. I never took notes in his class and still was getting above the median on his exams. All you have to do is memorize the lecture notes that he provides and you will be golden. Bio lab, compared to chem, is very neat, organized, and well managed. The only times the class felt stressful was when the midterm and final came around, when I was spending upwards to ten hours a day going through his provided lecture notes. However, when it wasn't exam season, I was chillin. He did make us read scientific papers, which were brutal to read. I never sat down to read the paper since he went over them leading up to the midterm. This strategy did screw me over in the final, but I did fine on the midterms.

However, he added a new section for our exams which entailed reading multiple research papers and completely memorizing all the details of each paper. For the final exam, he banned the teaching fellow, TA's, and other biology faculty from assisting students with the paper he assigned (nor did he).

Schaller also teaches the Biochem class in the biology department, so he might throw in a little extra info because he teaches it probably because he loves it and wants to talk about it, and I don't blame him. It didn't detract from the class in any way, and if people are planning on taking biochem anyways, why not learn a little bit now so they are more prepared for the future class? I didn't read the textbook ever, but it wasn't required and the exams are based on lectures, which are pretty thorough already. The exams may require a lot of memorization and using that information, but shouldn't every class ask you to remember what you learned and challenge you to use it?

Although these quizzes are absolutely terrible, they are still objectively fair and only worth 10% (even so they did do a bit of seemingly unnecessary damage to my grade- I don't find them as low stakes as you are told they are because constantly getting 60% on assignments that are overall worth 10% of your grade probably has a better chance than not of bumping your final grade down by one (from an A- to B+, a B+ to B, etc.) from what it would have been otherwise). Anyway, the class is extremely interesting and overall very very fair. I was discouraged to get a 67 on the first midterm, but after adapting/ adjusting to the course and the exam structure I was satisfied to see that I improved to a 78 on midterm 2 and an 85 on the final. Professor Grotz does an excellent job of explaining concepts, staying on topic, and taking time to address questions students would have during class as she was reviewing material. If it were not for those weekly vocab quizzes, this course probably would have shaped up to be my favorite so far at Dartmouth. It is challenging and requires abundant time and effort, but that's part of what makes it so awesome. The feeling you get when you finally understand everything about the secretory pathway or the regulation of the cell cycle is pretty cool, and rewarding--- I would get so happy each time (but that could just be my love for cell biology). Overall, the content is super super fascinating, the exams are very representative and Professor Grotz is an ideal instructor for the course-- I could just go without those terrible weekly quizzes. This course definitely made me more excited about my biology major than I was before it began.\"",
            "review 9: \"20F with Natasha Grotz: Co-taught with Sharon Bickel. This class is really god damn fucking hard. Profs lectures are straightforward, dry, and extremely boring. When taking notes make sure to basically copy everything they say verbatim in order to succeed on the weekly quizzes. Weekly vocab quizzes are not quizzes, and the averages are frequently below 15. They are extremely difficult and the only way to succeed is to go to Miranda (absolute angel/saint lovely TA) and talk about the content before classes. Utilizing her to the fullest is the key to success. Thank god that the 10 quizzes are only 10 percent of the grade, but they make you feel like shit after you fail every single one. Labs are meh, took them online and they weren't too bad. There are no extensive lab reports and there is no lab work outside of class besides prelab and Lab Assignment Summaries, which is 2-3 hours once every 3 weeks. Midterms honestly much easier than the quizzes, and they account for 60 percent (Midterm 1,2 and Final) of your grade. As long as you do well on those, you will be good. Medians INCREASE when more midterms are taken (71, 78). Overall, this is really difficult class and while its not impossible to succeed, it's really hard and you WILL feel stupid often after failing quizzes, but the content itself was sort of interesting. Only premeds and bio nuts take this class because its a shitty experience.\"",
            "review 10: \"20F with Natasha Grotz: This class was co-taught with Bickel (and there were a few guest lectures from Professor Smith). This class was incredibly hard and I have absolutely no idea how people in this class managed to score above the median. The lectures were incredibly long and dry and the class was set up such that we only met twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. While this might sound good, we had to do these easy but annoying reflection assignments on the lecture that were due the night before we met. And since the profs were making the videos as the course went, we usually only had 36 hours on the weekends to watch 2+ hours of lecture material. Also the videos were very dry and the weekly quizzes were SO nitpicky. There were so many \"check all that apply\" questions and if you checked a wrong box you could lose points. The exams were somewhat (only somewhat) better and like the other bio classes the TAs loved taking points off random things. Do NOT take this class unless you absolutely have to.\"",
            "review 11: \"19F with Natasha Grotz: Grotz told us on the first day that she didn't work as a researcher because her 'primary passion was teaching' -- despite this, I found her an unengaging and inefficient lecturer. We would speed through content and she made attendance at the lecture mandatory, which was probably the least helpful thing she could have done as I learned 90% of the material from rewatching the echo360 videos at my own pace / not at 9am half asleep. We had very little groupwork in class, but the ones we did have I thought was helpful to understand some of the concepts (i.e. protein folding in the membrane). Grotz was good at answering easy questions that people only asked for participation, but on multiple occasions didn't clarify concepts that we were confused on (even when asked repeatedly). Her exams were OK but I personally found the final really hard. In general, I was really excited before this class because I'm passionate about cell bio, but I really didn't enjoy the course. It felt like she chose arbitrary pathways to have us memorize and focused on us being able to spit them back at her without understanding really how they all fit together -- that might just be the structure of Bio 12 and has nothing to do with her, but certainly her teaching style didn't help.\""

            "review 1: \"23S with Bing He: This class was tough but really good. Be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. The midterms are tough but fair and require you to synthesize the info you\u2019ve learned and apply it. Prof He is incredibly nice. I didn\u2019t always love how his lectures were laid out, but do your best to pay attention in lecture and go back and rewatch if you zone out or something. I cannot stress this enough - GO TO TSF OFFICE HOURS. Hopefully you will have someone as good as Tanner. Use whiteboards, make concept maps, etc etc etc.\"",
            "review 2: \"23S with Bing He: Bing is one of the sweetest professors and genuinely wants all the students to do as well as possible. He explains concepts well, but everything is very fast paced, so I would definitely recommend rewatching all the lectures - or at least the ones covering important information. The two midterms were fair but difficult (both had 66 medians), and the final was quite easy. So many people dropped the class or withdrew, because it is a tough course that is very difficult to catch up on if you ever fall behind. My main pieces of advice would be to 1) show up to the lectures, even though they are recorded - trust, it is just better to be there in person 2) do every single practice question multiple times and redo in-class activities. Lab was pretty easy. They were time consuming and the individual assignments were a bit annoying, but we don't have lab during the week of midterms which is really nice. Overall, I thought that the course was okay, some of the content was boring, other parts were interesting. It was tough, but exams were fair. In general, if you're willing to put in the effort, you are likely to do reasonably well.\"",
            "review 3: \"22S with George Schaller: For the spring term, no cheat sheets were allowed, which made things marginally more difficult as you had to memorize everything. That being said, Prof. Schaller is a very personable person and made the structure of the course very well-organized. In addition, in comparison to Prof. Bing He, Prof. Schaller focuses on less details for each concept, making things a bit easier. However, he added a new section for our exams which entailed reading multiple research papers and completely memorizing all the details of each paper. For the final exam, he banned the teaching fellow, TA's, and other biology faculty from assisting students with the paper he assigned (nor did he). But, honestly, he did not instruct us on how to read scientific literature, so this exam portion felt very unfair. Overall, I'd say take the course during fall with Prof. Bickel.\"",
            "review 4: \"22S with Bing He: It's a good thing that Prof He only teaches in the Spring. If he taught in the Fall, some freshman students might still be under 18 and then this course would have been considered child abuse. His teaching style is not for everyone; personally, I found that going to class was not helpful at all and stopped going halfway through the term. His exams are brutal; his questions are designed to trick you and require more applying the material rather than memorization which I previously thought. However, if you meet him one-on-one for meetings, he's actually a really sweet man and a \"personal\" one as he says it. Overall, mixed feelings with Prof. He; he was a really interesting person outside of class and seemed really sweet but hard exams with a weird lecturing style. Some of the labs for BIOL 12 were actually interesting but others could be drop-dead boring. One thing I was really annoyed about was that the TAs took off points for the tiniest things -- this could be that you didn't mention a specifc word, didn't make a reference to a specfic table.... anyways it was just ridiculous as it went on. Honestly, towards the end, they should have just gone easier on us since it was a bit demoralizing to see half of lab drop out by the middle of the term.\"",
            "review 5: \"22S with Bing He: It's a good class but you should only take it if you need it (major/minor/premed). Half the class dropped the course if that tells you anything. Prof He is a good teacher, who explains things well in class and does everything to make exams easier to study for: clicker questions during lecture, in class group assignments (not graded, just practice), study strategies, and practice exams on canvas. There were two midterms and a final, each being 25% of your grade with your lab grade being the remaining 25%. Medians were as follows: midterm 1-77, midterm 2-70, final - 74.7. The lab grade median was not published at the time of writing this but my best guess would be somewhere between 90 and 93. The exams are based on applying memorized information regarding pathways/proteins to problems. You have to fully understand the ins and outs of a pathways to be able to answer the questions. For example, a question might be \"Describe what would happen if Rb was mutated such that G1 cyclin/CDK could not phosphorylate it\". I found myself sometimes crunched for time during exams but always managed to finish so just be wary that they may be long for you. The 2nd midterm is always the hardest so study hard for that one. I did better on it than the first midterm and I think that really helped my overall grade in the end. Lab is lab. 4 hours per week with 6 prelab quizzes, 4 in-lab team assignments, 2 larger and more formal summary assignments done alone, and an assignment for the 6th lab which is slightly shorter than the summary assignments but the same format. Take every pre lab quiz seriously so you don't lose stupid points. Pick a good lab partner. My lab partner was awesome and probably saved my ass from messing something up a couple of times. Grading in lab is dependent on your TA so just try to be as specific as possible and cover all your bases so you don't get screwed on a question. General suggestions to do well- Use lecture recordings efficiently; I found it useful to watch some of the recordings on 1.25-1.5x speed to help study for an exam as hearing his explanations again clarified a lot of the material. Take the in class activities seriously and do them again (he posts them on canvas) while studying for a test. Learn each pathway such that you can think through the steps in your head. Go to office hours if you are not getting the material. Go through your tests to see why you missed a what you did.\"",

The rest of the course grade is made up of participation/attendance/understanding checks. The flipped classroom sucks but I wouldn't know how this class would work without it. 2 hours of recorded lectures before our in-class problem-solving sessions was awful but that's the majority of the work for the class in my opinion. The problems in class and on the exam are not that difficult but rather require a lot of active recall. The understanding checks are kinda tough because they get really into the weeds with the details. I got lucky with my group--shoutout to my groupmates--for being so on top of everything which helped keep me motivated.

The tests did not feel like they were testing if you knew the content, but rather a game between the profs to see who could trick you the most. Yes, durning the fall we got \"cheat sheets\", but when I say (besides the final) those cheats sheets were useless, I mean I didn't look at it once because the exams were all application/extremely convoluted. Bickel even said the purpose of the cheat sheets was to have us review the material before the exam. Also we had weekly quizzes that were open from Friday at noon to Sunday at noon. This quizzes were really tricky so basically every weekend you were studying for a mini exam. However, this quizzes were good for the true/false on the exams because questions were typically recycled. The experiments we did in lab were cool but I didn't like how they were worth so little points because missing one point brings you to an 85.

The lab was drop dead boring but luckily could be completed pretty quickly. It obviously wasn't the same experience I would have had had I taken it in person, but I got everything I needed out of it (I'm pre-med, and not a bio major).\"",

We were only graded based on weekly quizzes and labs (the labs were SO boring and basically contentless but didn't require a lot of work or effort) but the lecture content was very dense. The quizzes were open note but still very tough. Professor Bezanilla was a WAY better lecturer in my opinion and explained the concepts way more clearly than Professor He. Prof Bezenilla's review sessions were very helpful but I would've failed this class without the teaching fellow Miranda. Her weekly review sessions SAVED me. She would write up full powerpoints with questions on the content for that week and would go through them in detail and would always answer any questions we had. Miranda ftw. Overall this class was tough but the content was definitely interesting.\""

All the lectures are recorded, the quizzes are take home, he hosts reliable and accessible office hours, and set up weekly peer tutoring groups. That being said I cried at least 6 times because of this class, and had a stress dream about one of the quizzes. Because of the way the grading system is set up, you don't really know how you are doing until you are done with that section - and the midterm and final are worth so much more than the quizzes. The class encourages you to think, connect and infer in a way I had never had before.

That being said, quizzes and exams are all open note and take home but NOT easy in any means. Prepare to book off quiz days and midterm/finals days for his tests, as it is a lot of critical thinking and requires you to sometimes sleep on it. He was very available and friendly for questions and put in a lot of effort for us to get help we needed. Study methods that worked included going to office hours frequently, asking anything that did not stick as soon as possible, going to the weekly Sunday study groups, and pretending to \"teach the material\" with a whiteboard when reviewing lecture slides, rewatching lectures, and doing all the homeworks and practice quizzes.\"",

He was also very available, and I often went to office hours to review questions I had, as well as mistakes I made on his tests, in an effort to better understand how he wanted us to solve the problems he set in the exams. Exams and quizzes were all open notes, but require a focus on detail as well as thoughtful analysis in order to get a correct answer.

This class is not a layup in any means. Professor Peterson approaches this course from a questioning and analyzing data perspective. Which, I'll admit, is really interesting and I learned a lot but this course wasn't worth the damage it did to my GPA. Professors love to say grades don't matter but they do if you're trying to go to graduate school. Professor Peterson himself is funny and always available if you have any questions but that only goes so far.

            "review 9: \"21F with Kevin Peterson: This is an amazing class, but it is definitely not a layup. Peterson will talk about topics in a way that will blow your mind. Some of the \"facts\" from high school biology will seem debatable after you start thinking about them critically. I would recommend this class to anyone fascinated by biology. However, this class is very challenging. There are 5 take-home assignments that contribute to your final grade: 3 quizzes, a midterm, and a final. I found them all to be about the same difficulty with the only difference being length. The questions are hard, and you need to spend a long time thinking about each one. Peterson occasionally throws in a definition based question as a freebie, but he wants you \"mulling over\" most of them. I have heard people say that this course is meant to weed out premeds and potential bio majors, and I would agree. One of my study group leaders for this course dropped biology and premed altogether after taking it. Here is how you can succeed in this class. Go to every lecture and meet with your study group to either ask questions or help other students. Your study group will be taught by former bio 11 students who did well in the class and they are an incredible resource. Everyone goes to the first study group meeting; very few showed up to the later ones. Be the person who shows up to all of them even if you are doing well. Do the optional homework that is assigned weekly. The homework will help you get used to the types of questions that Peterson will ask on tests and quizzes. Go to office hours when you are confused. Peterson is very helpful and patient with any questions you might have. Learn how to use your resources efficiently. You have access to Canvas while taking tests and quizzes, so make sure you have a general idea about where information is on certain topics. Here are my general recommendations for you. If you are just looking for an intro to biology course, take bio 2. If you are serious about a major or minor in bio, take this course.\"",

He is a great guy, and means really well, but his class is very difficult. A huge part of the class is teaching yourself, especially while you're completing assignments.

Not a layup, but if you pay attention and use office hours when needed you will do fine. Also he spotted all of us an extra point on the final even though the class is not formally curved. He teaches basic biology concepts using complex ideas and theories, which makes the content very interesting. He is a funny guy and I was engaged, even during the 9L spot. The entire term is like one long story, and on the last class it all came together and left us all in awe. Highly recommend if you have any interest in bio or medicine.\"",

I think he made a real effort to support his students and was extremely flexible when it came to office hours. Though the content of this class is pretty complex, it was super interesting. I think I would have used the NRO option for this class had I known about it at the time. Exams were open note, but that did not help much if you did not understand the concepts. Memorizing will not help you for this class, instead, you should understand the concepts and how they are to be applied in varying contexts. Anyway, Professor Peterson was an absolutely amazing professor, when I felt I was struggling he was very helpful in helping me to find resources to help. I would def take this course again and hope to take more classes by Prof P in the future!\"",

It's unbelievably inspiring-- I leave many classes with my mind blown, wanting to learn more and investigate the mysteries of modern bio. HOWEVER, this is not at all a layup. I came in considering whether to take this class or a foundations class, and while I wouldn't change my decision if I could, it definitely was not the easier of the two options like I had imagined. Foundations classes are super content based, which typically gets the rep as being harder, but I found this class to be much more challenging than other stem classes I've taken because it makes you think in such a different way. His tests aren't at all about basic content and memorization-- he wants you to be learning on every exam and thus his questions are very difficult and require a level of problem-solving that I didn't have before this class. It's the kind of stuff that makes you bang your head against a wall until you have your \"eureka!\" moment. Definitely have a love-hate relationship with this style. Overall, I would recommend it for the prof and the material, just know what you're getting yourself into.\"",

Even if you don't end up taking this class, make sure you take one of Professor Peterson's courses during your time here at Dartmouth; he's one of those guys who students say 'take the class for the teacher, not the content.' Currently in Bio 13 and even though the info is more up my alley I enjoyed 11 more solely because of Prof Peterson. Even met a cute girl from this class. Would recommend 10/10.\"",

The class had lectures in class (and every X hour was used), plus optional homework. The homework wasn't graded but you should still try to do it, as methods and content is taught through the problems that isn't taught very much in class. There were three quizzes, one midterm, and a final. The online version of the course had take home tests, that he would give between 3-7 days to complete and turn back in. They were challenging but also very interesting, which I would say is an apt description of the class. The class is framed to use the human genome to describe basic biological concepts as well as biological history, which can be difficult to wrap your head around if you don't have a whole lot of experience. It's a good idea to take this class as practice in the ideas of biological investigation, not as rote fact memorization. Some of the stuff taught are ideas that aren't necessarily what you've learned before in school, but the focus is more on the examination of evidence and what that evidence suggests, rather than the exact idea being taught.\"",

There are 5 graded assignments in the entire term (3 quizzes, 1 mid-term, 1 final), and each of these are very difficult because he takes you through a learning journey in each quiz.

If you come to him with a question, he makes sure that you understand the answer and reasoning before you leave, so office hours are very helpful and the key to succeeding in this class. The most difficult part of the course was definitely following his lectures, not because he was incoherent but because he introduces new methods of looking at biology that challenge common perceptions, so it takes some time to get used to his thinking.

He also has both group and individual office hours several times a week. The course itself was pretty difficult - there's no textbook since the class is all Peterson's personally-created curriculum, and your entire grade is made up of four quizzes (each 10% of your final grade) and two exams (a take-home midterm and an in-class final, each 30% of your final grade). That being said, I LOVED the course because of how different it is. There's a new \"gene of the week\" each week that we focused on to reveal something about the evolution of life, and there were many moments during lecture when all students' minds were blown. Even though there's no lab component to the class, students still get a good grasp of how the scientific method works, both by proposing hypotheses and evaluating others; one of my favorite aspects of the course was Peterson's tendency to look at FAMOUS, PUBLISHED scientific articles and refute their claims with his own hypotheses. I know that many students loved the course like I did, and many other students really disliked it. I would advise potential students to keep in mind the fact that there's no textbook, which can sometimes be frustrating since his powerpoints aren't always super clear by themselves. Other students took issue with the fact that the material in the class, which I personally found super interesting, is often controversial (since many of the hypothesis we covered aren't generally accepted by all scientists) and may not always directly relate to the material of future classes. That being said, if you're truly interested in the topic and willing to put in the time to do the homework and readings, Peterson is a super supportive, funny person who, in his own words, \"won't let you leave his office with a wrong answer.\" He won't just give it to you, but he'll definitely steer you in the right direction.\""

They're both very funny, approachable, the lectures I thought were really interesting, and they offer a ton of office hours. I went to one with McClung and we chatted about his research and professional hockey. I can't emphasize enough how cool the profs are. There's not textbook for the course, so the studying will be reviewing lecture slides and lecture notes. They had us read a book about the flu, though, but they gave us a month and a half to read it. Also they have us read ~1 scholarly (usually short) article before each lecture, and then they go over it. Lecture recordings are also available if you want to clarify something, or if you missed a class. The tests are generally fair, I guess. They get pretty specific, but that's to be expected based on the content of the lectures. All questions for the most part require involved written responses. My only gripe with the tests is that often times the questions are phrased generally, but are graded based on mentioning several specific things. So a question could generally ask about the DNA replication process, but unless you mention complementarity, antiparallelism, which end is which, and what the replication enzyme is, you would only get partial credit.

Study, not just the night before, and rewatch the posted lectures. My quiz grades went up 2-3 points when I started doing this. Also, join a study group, especially if you have financial aid. DO NOT TAKE WITH A LANGUAGE CLASS. The combination of drill bio spanish within 3 hours 3 days a week will make you want to transfer. Buy the textbook, if you want, off Amazon, to save 40 bucks or so. Go to office hours, Jack's especially, and get a study partner. Professors are great, for the most part. I'm biased because I'm much more into ecology than molecular and genetics stuff, taught by Peart and Jack respectively. They stress early on that this isn't a survey course. I kind of wish it had been, because I didn't take AP bio in HS. You will however, learn a lot about human evo and a ****Ton about Drosophila. The reading is fairly interesting. Even if you do not take the class, read Before the Dawn. Overall, very interesting, very hard. It might be a weeding out course, as far as bio majors are concerned. I suggest comparison shopping the other Bio 11 sections before taking. I might be one of the \"weeded\" ones.\"",

Despite the painful classes, though, the course is pretty easy if you read, probably even easier if you actually go to and stay awake in class (if not, the powerpoints are posted and podcasted). Simply pay attention to the information presented in the powerpoints (ALL of it) and read the required book (the others are unnecessary), and the quizzes won't be as bad as everyone makes them out to be.

I definitely learned a lot, and my interest in genetics and biology in general helped hold my interest through sometimes soporific lectures. Most of the material is easy to grasp, but Peart and Jack picked very specific, almost arbitrary questions from lecture that didn't have much to do with understanding the material as a whole. The quizzes are definitely hard, but they force you to keep up with the material since they take place each week - a good style for me since I tend to fall behind when I'm not forced to be working. Wade readings are interesting, but they are somewhat long for the number of questions pulled from them for each quiz (if I remember correctly, 0-3). Not a good class for someone interested in taking an actual intro to bio course -- seemed more geared towards those who already had prior knowledge or pre-meds.\"",
            "review 11: \"08F with David Peart: Unlike most other colleges, Dartmouth makes students take this introductory course before taking classes where you will learn typical bio material like Genetics and Physiology. Peart and Jack cover the very niche and specific topics of organism (mostly Drosophila) development and evolutionary biology. It is a pretty interesting topic, because it is something you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find in the typical first bio course. Nevertheless, at times the material can be tedious (Seriously, is it important to know every factor that makes EVE Stripe-2?), repetitive, and more importantly, just a random (specific biology facts/impractical knowledge you will never use again). The main theme \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DNA to Diversity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, is the profs attempt to link the foundations of evolution to mechanisms at the gene/cell level and sometimes seems a stretch. The course is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It is very manageable compared to other courses, especially for a first year considering it has no lab. If you have taken AP Biology or a half decent bio class, the material is EXTREMELY easy because Peart and Jack try to make the concepts as simple as possible. Oddly, the course and the quizzes often times assume background knowledge in Biology. People who took a good Bio class (More then Half the class.) are much more comfortable with the material, which helps a lot on the long answers in classes. I can imagine that this course would be difficult for a total newbie to Bio. The course goes through material at a fast paced, and people who do not know punnet squares, mitosis, DNA duplications etc will be playing catch up. Newbies probably have to study a lot harder. More importantly, Bio 11 is not equalized skill wise. Lectures are for the most part intriguing. Peart is concise and able to explain evolution topics which otherwise could have been confusing. He is a friendly, approachable guy who is extremely knowledgeable and passionate. What I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand is why Jack has such a bad rep. People complain that he is a confusing teacher, who is uninteresting/boring. I thought he was a good at conveying the big points and he is a nice guy. His topic, cellular/genetics biology is inherently pretty dull/complicated. Both profs. are good and you will learn a lot (of random facts) if you study. GO TO OFFICE HOURS B/c they WANT to answer questions and know students. Lectures are podcasted, which is nice, but go to class anyway b/c they use the board. We had to read Before the Dawn, which was kind of bogus. It is a nice, interesting read about evolution of Man but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really enhance what we learned in class. In fact it had little to do with what we learned in lecture. Look out for the random facts from the book that they put into quizzes. Carolls book and Biological Sciences are optional, and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tested. Lets be honest, most kids who take this are eager freshman pre-meds. Thus, grades are important. The quizzes, by far, are the biggest complaint about this class. First, quizzes are every week on the X hour (brutal but serve as a nice review). Quizzes are based on lecture, but many times they would test on obscure detail facts. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t uncommon that they would test on material where you had to assume something, which was never taught thoroughly. It does seem that the profs. are out to trick you on the quizzes through ambiguous wording. and questions on obscure details. Because the material is so simple, the quizzes are not a measure of how well you know the concepts/material but rather on how well you can take their tests/understand what Peart and Jack want. Kind of like the SAT (logic based, not material). I felt Grading is pretty fair. Warning: Getting an A is difficult because your grade is judged by the median, which is high because the material is so easy and we go to Dartmouth. There is little room for error, even though your lowest quiz is dropped. Go to class, do the work you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll for sure get a B. This is not a class that you can slack off in. It is essential to study EVERY detail (no matter how obscure) because it will likely show up on the quiz. Only take this course as a pre-req. The material is interesting because it is a unique topic, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how this class achieves its main goal of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making a student think like a biologist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The trickiness of the quizzes takes away significantly from the class, and the EvoDevo stuff we learned doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have any application in future Bio classes. You can do well if you learn how to take the quizzes, but how does this advance our Biology knowledge? If this class serves as a weed out, it has done well, as the class can be very discouraging and frustrating at times. Nevertheless, if you work hard/don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slack off you will hopefully get a decent grade. Take this review, and other reviews of this hated/loved class with a grain of salt. How difficult the course is depends on the student, their background in bio and ability to read questions/predict the MOST ACCEPTABLE answers on quizzes. On the bright side, there are worse Intro classes out there. Bio 11 was tolerable. Nevertheless, I do hope the Bio department re-evaluates the function of Bio 11 in Dartmouth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biology curriculum.\"",

And the breakdown between grades is literally an extra point or two average per quiz which just comes down to who figured out their tricks and who assumed they wanted to test your knowledge of the material. There were many times when I would get a question wrong and look back in my notes and still agree with the answer that I wrote down until I looked at the key and saw them explain that you needed to see this one little trick.

The quizzes are really difficult, though, and a lot of times you just have to study all you can and hope for the best. I'd also like to point out that the professors are amazing. Even though there were ~180 students, both professors made an effort to learn everyone's name. I went to Professor Jack's office hours every week, and by the end of the term he knew what I was involved in on campus, where I was from, etc. It seemed like both of them were really making an effort to inspire interest, be accessible, and work with their students.

It's also good to keep in mind that the course is a work in progress, and that scientists don't know exactly how everything works together (that is, each and every step of how the molecular mechanisms of DNA lead up to the diversity of life). A lot of research is currently being done on the subject. But scientists have the general idea, and this course definitely brings that to light. Both professors are good at teaching the course. Go to office hours early on in the course if you don't understand stuff. They are good at explaining things, but seem to be most comfortable explaining things within their respective fields.

They are pretty good at developing strategies for you to improve.

The readings were generally more of a supplement to lectures than what the lectures were based right off, and they were interesting and tied into the course well. Quizzes were weekly, which, in the long run, were helpful to making sure you don't get behind in the material. The subject material itself was really interesting, and the professors seemed to be very interested in the topic as well.

None of the other supplementary books were necessary at ALL. I'm pissed that I wasted over $100 dollars on them so please don't. All you need is Wade and the lectures. (Also, they post podcasts of lectures on blackboard so you don't even have to go to class except for quizzes.

If you're biology background is weak, you will spend too much time understanding the mechanism and not the way it connects to evolution. Simple regurgitation will not suffice. Lecture notes can only help so much. Simply understanding HOW each molecular or evolutionary process functions is not enough. You need to bridge it all together. In 10 weeks, this can be a bummer. I won't discourage you from taking the class, but I advise you to study hox genes, dna replication, evolution, and the stages of embryonic development in drosphila before you enter - in detail!

So basically if you're like me and already love bio, you might find it boring and a waste of time (but at least the lectures are online so you can sleep in no problem), while if you haven't had a lot of experience with bio before, be prepared to study a lot and be sure to go to office hours, the profs are both very nice (and Peart has an amazing australian accent, as well as a sense of humor which makes his lecture slightly more interesing.)\"",

Do I think it sparked my interest about cool developments in Bio? Definitely. Some people say \"oh this class is only for Bio majors\" or \"Thank goodness I took AP Bio!\" I fit neither category, and did alright in the course. There are weekly quizes for 80% of the total grade and the 20% goes towards the final, which is just like a comprehensive \"two quizes in one.\" The trick is to stay on top of the weekly lecture material. This course was very good about providing tricks and doodads to help you get your studying on: 1) podcasted lectures - key 2) downloadable lecture powerpoint slides - another key 3) old quizes and answer keys 4) online discussion board, with teachers answering questions The classic go-to help option, the office hours, were apparently super helpful if you actually took the time to consolidate your confusion into a coherent question. Even barring that, the profs were usually happy to walk you through stuff. I went to one office hour, sorta, not really. I bet it's worth it. I read the non-required books early in the term, but found that doing the reading each week didn't seem to have any effect on my grade. Probably improved my understanding though, especially for the final. Prof. Peart was really dynamic in class and a pretty good lecturer. Prof. Jack tended to read straight off the powerpoint and wasn't as dynamic. I'd say for having a 180 person class, I still had a good experience. Go to the lectures. I recommend DNA to Diversity.

For those who didn't take AP Bio in high school, I think this would be a much harder class (or would at least take more work to get to the same place those who had taken it are at). We had a quiz every Thursday on the material from the preceding 3 classes, which obviously sucked at the time especially when all of your friends are out on Wednesday night. But, the quizzes made sure you kept on top of the material and the reading, which made this almost like a high school class, so for freshmen Bio 11 was a great transition to college science classes in my opinion. And even though the weekly studying sucked, in the end it was definitely worth it because studying for the final was pretty much just refreshing your memory, since you had already studied all the material. As for the quizzes themselves, as long as you study ALL the material in the lectures (which is only 3 days worth of material...) and know it cold, the quizzes aren't hard. Professors Jack and Peart were very understanding and were helpful outside of class, and I felt like they really wanted everyone to do well in the class. They give organized lectures, and are available to answer questions any time. You can even post questions on the discussion page on blackboard and they will post an answer at least within a few hours, which is extremely helpful when studying. From what I've heard, the other Bio 11 section this term was MUCH worse, but I really enjoyed this class and the professors, so take it with Prof Jack and Peart!\""

I took a different Bio 11 during my freshman spring, and though different in subject matter they where both the same in many other ways. They were very difficult, didn't help me learn biology, and were a waste of time. The only difference between this bio 11 and the other bio was the fact that I was smart enough to NRO this bio 11. If you are not biology major but just Pre-med, I RECOMMEND YOU TO NRO THIS COURSE (or any bio 11). You will save yourself from averaging in really bad grade into your GPA or getting a W for withdrawing too late (this happened to me last year). And getting a pass for a grade for this particular science course is okay because Bio 11 is not counted as a course for the pre-med track. You only need to take bio 11 because it is a prereq for the classes that do count for the pre-med track (bio 12, bio 13, etc.).

Take Emerging Infectious Diseases with Mary Lou Guerinot (she is a goddess among profs) or take Cooperation and Conflict.I am in EID now and it is much better, offers a better and more comprehensive view of intro bio, and is just generally more fair and interesting.

If you don't, get ready to lose points. Getting your test back is essentially worthless, becuase you really cannot learn anything from the stupid questions, which are unrelated to the next set of random situations you'll get on the next test. One of the profs got a 400 on the SAT and starts off by saying the whole class is smarter than him. This may be so, but evidently it's kinda difficult for smart people to understand him regardless. Things are constantly described as \"simple.\" and \"right in front of you.\" And we know this is true because graduate level cladograms and other complicated charts that this guy spent years working on should be immediately accessible to first year bio students. On a more serious note, the powerpoints were awful. These guys might actually be able to benefit from professional development on making powerpoints. There's virtually no information on the slides, and you have to take paragraphs of notes explaining what's going on in the slides. On the upside, there is very little you can do, once in the class, to do better in the class. So if you're reasonably good at logical thinking, you'll be able to do ok in the class without putting in much effort. You could put in 1 hour or 10 hours per week and you'll do no better, rest assured.

Prof Peterson, on the other hand, was a good lecturer and clear. The only problem is that his clarity didn't help much to undo the mess that Prof Sloboda created. I only recommend this class to those who are sure biology is the \"vocation\" and to those who have biochemistry background knowledge. This is DEFINITELY not a class to simply get a SCI requirement out of the way. It is a toughie.\""

            "review 2: \"09W with Roger Sloboda: Let me just tell you that this class was so terrible that I dropped it before we even took the first exam because it was literally miserable. The professors spoke about random things that were not scientifically related and had nothing to do with what was on the exam. Exams were take home and I wouldn't say they were necessarily difficult, but they just had nothing to do with the material that was semi taught in class. There was no book, and reading was entirely supplemental information that we were not expected to know. So what were we expected to know? That was entirely unclear until the exam came and then the answer was everything we hadn't been taught. In conclusion. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU WANT A MISERABLE WINTER. Take Emerging Infectious Diseases with Mary Lou Guerinot (she is a goddess among profs) or take Cooperation and Conflict.I am in EID now and it is much better, offers a better and more comprehensive view of intro bio, and is just generally more fair and interesting. I have heard good things about C&C as well.\"",

            "review 4: \"09S with Mary Lou: This class is a prerequisite for pretty much all of the biology courses at D. Lots of premed students here. I decided to take this section (as opposed to the other ones during different terms) because the topic seemed interesting... however upon taking the class I found that, while the course covers a wide spread of material, it's not presented in the most effective way. Lots of memorization involved. I feel like this course would be better served if it came after the foundations bio classes, since the actual biology involved in this class is actually very complex. It seemed strange to be \"covering\" all the genetics involved in infectious disease in just one day, considering there are multiple courses devoted to this subject in higher bio classes. Basically, as long as you can selectively memorize the material in the lectures, then you don't really have to have any thorough understanding of biology as a way of thinking about things. I felt that the class didn't really serve to help students develop important science critical thinking/problem solving skills. Professors were responsive, however I found that they tended to oversimplify their responses to questions. Also, there were consistent problems in communication - clarity of language (or lack thereof) was an issue in the lectures and sample quiz questions. Doing the sample quiz questions provided, I felt that the questions didn't really direct students to the right way to answer them. Also, they were sometimes worded awkwardly/incorrectly so that students would produce answers that technically answered the question, as it was worded, correctly, but weren't in response to what the profs actually intended the question to ask. Maybe it's just me, but I felt that there were some political issues too. IMO, profs shouldn't mix their own personal political beliefs into classes, typically in subjects like econ, gov, etc. But on more than one occasion, even in a science class, this problem came up - profs would make subtle but clear ad hominem attacks on certain Republican politicians... interesting way of engaging students by playing into a \"liberal\" youth demographic? But inappropriate for a class.\"",
            "review 5: \"09S with Mary Lou: i've heard that this section of bio 11 is the best and the most interesting. i didn't think biology was interesting until i took this course. i found the topic of illness fascinating. the course focuses mainly on malaria, TB, AIDS, and influenza, and you learn basic biology through this framework of disease. those interested in psych may also find this course interesting because we discuss brain disease and how other diseases have learned to adapt and manipulate their hosts to increase the spread of the disease. you learn a lot about current global health issues, potential solutions and future threats as well. the quizzes are a little tricky and often confusingly phrased - expect to mess up the first one, but after you get a hang of their style and talk to them during office hours, you will improve. if you have any problems or questions, brad taylor is great in office hours, but i found mary lou to show little sympathy for any problems/personal issues. also, mary lou seems uninterested and unhelpful when she does not know the answer to a question you ask her. overall, i preferred brad taylor (because he is more personable) for office hours, and mary lou for lectures (because she is more clear and less shy in front of an audience.) also, you don't really have to attend class if you think you will learn better by podcast because all the lectures are on podcasts online and the powerpoints as well. half of the readings are horribly written and filled with science jargon, but it's important to at least do them and grasp the main points.\"",

It saves a ton of hassle listening to 5-7 hours worth of podcasts the night before each test. Mary Lou is SOOO NICE!! She is a good lecturer and wants to make this class as good for you as she can. I slept through a test once by accident (it was at 8am, give me a break) and she let me make it up later. You need to study for the tests.

The types of questions asked will not ask you to regurgitate information from lectures, but assumes you already know that information and then asks you to apply it. It was really cool having two teachers, so we were looking at disease from two different perspectives - ecology and microbiology, and I think it tied them together well.

Prof. Berger also shared some of his discoveries, and made things as basic as possible.

The main challenge was figuring out what was required for us to know and what wasn't, since frequently the professors would be like, \"oh, this is beyond the scope of the course, but just FYI, here's the answer.\" And then you're sitting there thinking, \"Do I have to know this or not??\" Berger and Ayres both have a dry sense of humor that helped me stay awake in class. The material was not that interesting or boring; it's just an intro bio class. I thought that Ayres was a more effective lecturer because he gave lots of visual examples on the board, while Berger didn't. Ayres's stated philosophy is, \"If anyone gets 100% on my test, it's too easy.\" This got kind of frustrating after a while. I spent lots of work on this class, and I was hitting the median every time, just because Ayres likes to put one or two really esoteric questions on each quiz, so that no one gets the magic 100%. As far as an intro bio class goes, I thought that this class was pretty good. It was more interesting than it could have been, and even though it was a decent amount of work, I did OK.\"",

Paying attention is a must though, as there is no text book. Ayres and Berger are extremely willing to help all the time though.

For one, it is more of a problem solving course than anything else. Problems: 1. The material was either too general or too specific. I found myself memorizing various molecules, enzymes and genes without really grasping the bigger picture. 2. Despite the fact that it is a problem solving course, we were given very few practice problems. I would have appreciated a lot more practice problems from old quizzes. 3. The textbook, which I spent $100 on, was rarely used, despite the fact that it covered most of the basics, and had the potential to be a useful source. 4. The class never covered the basics, and went straight into scientific and technical jargon. 5. I did not feel that the powerpoint slides were a good source of knowledge. I did not find that it helped me learn the material well. The supplementary reading was often very dry, and difficult to comprehend. Overall, this class made me reconsider my decision to be pre-med.

Despite that, I did not do as well as I would have liked to in this class. I think part of that is due to the sporadic nature of the material covered. Although there is supposed to be a unifying theme for the course (\"cooperation and conflict\"), this rarely came through, and I felt that there was very little connective tissue between topics discussed. The material was either too general or too specific and never seemed to relate to the bigger biological picture. I think it is a huge problem that students come from vastly different backgrounds when it comes to their experience in biology. Some students hadn't taken biology since 9th grade, while many others clearly had extensive experience with the material (in AP and beyond). Everything in the class is graded on a curve, which inspires a rather negative competitive atmosphere. Beware: this class never covers the basics. You dive right into new material that will be terrifying and unfamiliar if you have a weak background in biology. Professor Bickel is wonderful -- engaging and accessible. She explains things CLEARLY and effectively. Professor Calsbeek is easy to like -- witty and silly -- but I often found that he was confusing and unable to explain things clearly. Having said that, both professors are very enthusiastic and really want to help you. Podcast recordings of the lectures were helpful. Finally, don't buy the textbook. It costs $125 and is NEVER EVER used. Overall, a weeder course for pre-meds. I think everyone felt discouraged, but I've been told that the sciences at Dartmouth greatly improve after this.\"",

The theme of \"cooperation and conflict\" was vague and often felt forced. This class was hard, but I learned quite a bit.

The professors emphasized quantity over quality of information, inundating us with tons of information, most of which was irrelevant, and glossing over the important overarching concepts. By rushing through the material, class was useless, just a race to finish the slides. Yes, the professors made time for questions and tried to get the class involved. However, it was still painful to sit in class, listening to incomprehensive lectures. Even with the time they made for questions, the great number of unanswered questions that the lectures created could not be addressed. (I'm not talking about hypothetical/theoretical application questions the curious student might ask; I'm refering to the dozens of clarifications of information that there wasn't time to talk about because we had to finish the lecture). In terms of the information being both insanely detailed and incomprehensive, I, for example, don't understand why a slide was dedicated to glaucophyta (who cares, right?) but the intermediate stage of cellular respiration and fermentation were completely neglected. In conclusion: If you love bio or are pre-med, meaning you have to take bio 11, don't take this section! If the other section offered that term doesn't pique your interest, WAIT.

Bickel knows her shit and answers questions really well, so it's just a matter of paying attention past the sound of her voice (you'll understand what I mean after the first lecture). The quizzes require you to apply your knowledge and even combine the different presentations, but you don't have a lot of time. You need to be specific and comprehensive, but in 50 minutes, which isn't great. There's \"recommended/required reading\" for every presentation, but you don't have to do it.

Unlike other bio 11's, this is a really broad based course so you can learn what aspect of bio you're most interested in before you take upper level courses. This course didn't assign alot of homework; there were readings due before each lecture, but it wasn't really necessary to read them until there was a quiz. Quizzes were pretty detailed and really required alot of studying, but if you pay attention in lectures and study alot before the test you're fine.

            "review 11: \"09F with Sharon Bickel: I would say that if you're looking for a realistic introduction to the science/life science classes here at Dartmouth, cooperation and conflict is the appropriate course. Professor Bickel was a very effective lecturer, and I'm coming out of the class, thinking that I have a pretty good idea what the important ideas in cell biology are, and what I'm expected to learn in Bio 12. On the other hand, Prof. Calsbeek's lectures were ambiguous at best. He does respond to questions in class readily (which is really impressive in a 150+ person class), but often his answers would create even more confusion. I used to think that I would enjoy ecology/evolutionary biology, but because of this class, I'm not going to pursue that field. Though interesting, it's too open-ended. Calsbeek is pretty good about reintroducing old concepts time and again, but that doesn't necessarily make his assertions convincing. He needs to rethink how he presents his material. His powerpoint slides are also confusing at certain points(whereas Bickel's are pretty self-explanatory all throughout even though the concepts are new and involved). I also wish Calsbeek chose outside readings that were appropriate to this level of this class. They were difficult to understand and often not necessary. I did like the lecture where we watched a couple episodes from the reality TV show Survivor, because it's actually a good real-life representation of what we learned in class. It's clear that the two profs give an effort to make Bio 11 a good class. So content-wise, I satisfied with the class. But I wish the quizzes could have reflected the amount of work I put into the class. They are definitely different from the ones you get in high school--there are no multiple choice questions, it's all in short answer format. And the questions don't ask you to recall information, but rather to apply it to some problem that you never saw before. It's good practice, I guess. Bio 11 is decent, and it's required for all subsequent bio classes. So there's no reason not to take it.\"",

            "review 14: \"09F with Sharon Bickel: Before you sign up for the class, be aware that this is a weed out class. It is meant to discourage the 50% of the freshman class who arrives at Dartmouth thinking they will be pre-med Bio majors. As a humanities major who wanted to take a few bio classes out of interest and for the educational value, the course was very disappointing. First, the course covers a lot of irrelevant information. Some topics are covered in great depth and specificity, while others are glazed over or not even mentioned. I do not see how an introductory class can go into detail about ran transport and not mention genetic technology, or spend half a lecture on the speciation of blue belly lizards but never go into photosynthesis. Each class covered one topic that had little connection to the classes before it. Class often ended up being a race to finish the Powerpoint before 11:50. This would not have been a problem if we had a book to read ahead in or if the classes had some sort of flow or constancy throughout the units. Unfortunately, neither of these were the case. Another problem I had was with the methods of assessment. On some occasions, important material ended up not even being covered on the exams. The immune system, a topic that was covered in 3 lectures during the quarter, was not even covered on the exam. Calsbeek and Bickel said that it was a problem solving course, and the quizzes reflected that. We were expected to not only know the material on the quizzes, but to also synthesize it and apply it to different situations. This is how assessments should be; however, it would have been nice to have had more practice. Aside from a few practice problems that were posted on Blackboard before the quizzes, there was no opportunity to practice these types of questions, which were new to most students, That being said, I do think that Calsbeek and Bickel wanted Bio 11 to be a good experience. They always showed up for office hours, were responsive to questions posted on Blackboard and in class, and held extra review sessions before the final. I have a bit of a problem with the intro bio courses in general. There are several different sections of Bio 11 that all cover different material\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI fail to see how the biology department can claim that this is a necessary introductory course if all the sections introduce different material. I have heard the bio department is looking into changing the way they do their intro classes, and I hope that they will eliminate this needless weed out class and make the bio sequence more friendly towards non-majors. Bottom line: If, like me, you are looking to see if you might want to take a few bio classes and fulfill a few distribs, I would recommend you do it with one of the lower numbered topical courses first.\"",

The blackboard site is good; but beware the version of the lecture slides that you should study from and the version of the lecture which is posted at 11PM on the night before the lecture can be different since Bickel and Calsbeek will make updates to the lectures. The grading format is pretty easy five quizzes each weighted at 20%, for the final exam which is a quiz you get more time but it is still worth the same amount of points. The quizzes are all essays, not short answers; you are expected to write a fair amount to get full credit. The x-hours on the even numbered weeks are used for holding quizzes, so remember you only have 45-50 minutes to scratch down everything that you can think of. Otherwise the other x-hours are not used, so you only have to go to class for two, two-hour periods per week. Most days you get a bathroom break after the first hour. Bickel and Calsbeek typically alternate the lectures; Bickel is a Cell and Molecular Biology Professor and Calsbeek and Ecological and Evolutionary Biology Professor. Both are very knowledgeable and were available for us outside of class. Office hours with both professors were packed towards the end of the term despite the fact that the enrollment for the class was only 66 students compared to the 9L DNA to Diversity section which had over 125 students and used each morning x-hour for a test. Bickel is kind, she often is better in one on one office hours rather than the group setting. Also during class she occasionally will throw in a plug for her Biol-71 class which I guess she hoped that we would all take later on. Otherwise she was very clear when she lectured, aside from catching a cold for several lectures. Calsbeek is great. He kept the audience entertained when he lectured and also handled questions from the rude know it all who sat in the back of the class very well. His dog was always at office hours and is worth meeting, the dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name is Dex (really Dexter). The only rule he had at office hours was that he would stop meeting with people when they said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do we need to know this (fill in a topic or question) for the test?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at that point he would ask everyone to leave, I guess he took it hard when people really wanted to just understand something to get by.

That was a good system because it took off pressure during finals. The lectures were engaging. A lot of diverse material was covered, and the profs tried to make it interactive. It was easy to keep awake. Prof. Bickel had a sing-song voice sometimes which set my teeth on edge, but she's really nice and approachable. Prof. Calsbeek was funny and I enjoyed his lectures. They both made an effort to learn everybody's names, which was impressive in a class this size. There must have been about a hundred students (though not all of them always showed up to class) and they still managed to make the class feel friendly and as if they were noticing you. That's downright amazing if you ask me. About the readings-- they were difficult. Don't even try to plough through the details. Understanding a vague summary, along with what's discussed in class, is enough. Lectures (powerpoint notes) are posted on Blackboard, which is really convenient when studying time comes round. Sometimes you really do have to go to class, though, because then you get a better idea of what's important and what might come up. A couple of classes are spent without lectures and no notes are posted-- you can bet that those will come up in the exams!

Collins reading was interesting, but the testing of the reading was erratic and aggravatingly random. The material is not difficult and unlike a lot of other Bio classes, there's not a ton of information to memorize. This made for incredibly frustrating tests that involved deciphering confusing, tricky questions designed to artificially generate a curve (One question was literally a picture of a graph that showed up once in one of his powerpoints and a prompt that said: \"Label the axes\"). Class consisted of only five 20 point quizzes and a final. The small number of questions meant that a couple mistakes could result in scores at or below the median. Thankfully, professor Jack lets you drop your lowest score. Overall, a poorly designed course that was most likely designed to weed out students. However, Bio 11 is a necessary evil to get to more interesting biology classes and this is probably the least painful of the offerings at Dartmouth. Professor: Professor Jack was one of the highlights of this poorly designed course. He's accessible, knowledgable, and friendly. He genuinely tries to meet his students (you'll be surprised that he knows the name of almost every student in this ~150 person class). Go to office hours, it'll help you get an idea of what might be on the next quiz (he'll tell you what not to focus on) and it's fun getting to meet him. Workload: The silver lining to this frustrating course is that the workload is very light. 1-3 chapters of Collins every 2 weeks and that's pretty much it. Go to class, take notes, read Collins, study the powerpoints well (everything you need to know is on those powerpoints, don't bother with the textbook he recommends or any other outside material) and make sure you know every detail on those slides (I mean it, memorize the graphs and axes, memorize little subtitles and obscure facts).

Peart and Jack know their material well and are pretty efficient lecturers, plus all powerpoints and podcasts are posted on blackboard, which makes reviewing convenient. The profs are enthusiastic (though Jack could be a little intimidating) and want you to do well. There are 5 quizzes and a final, and one quiz gets dropped. The quizzes are about half mc and half free response, and there are practice quizzes available online. There is also a 2% participation grade which you get through clickers. You don't need the optional textbook if you have a good background in bio (and even if you don't, the profs explain everything in lectures anyway). The two required reading books are both nonfiction. One of them was briefly included in each quiz; the other was never tested on so you don't really have to read it. It could be a relatively homework-free class if you don't do the reading, but every quiz (there are 5, one gets dropped) required massive amounts of reviewing. The profs are very good about answering questions and explaining material during office hours, which usually turn into mini-classes because a lot of people show up. The quizzes are hard, so make sure you review really well--all the material you need is on blackboard. Overall, a good, solid foundation class.\""

McClung: The friendlier of the two, always happy to get involved in interesting conversations with students, but not as strong as a lecturer. Too many slides, too many words on the slides (some basically directly from the textbook), so it can be hard to figure out what you should take away from the lectures and what the key points are.

Peterson's style towards teaching is an extremely enlightened one: he doesn't focus on nitpicky details, but instead wants you to learn concepts and ideas. He teaches you to think for youself and evaluate data instead of just being spoon-fed what the right answer is -- he gives us readings by scientists with whom he vehemently disagrees, and then leads us Socratically towards finding reasons to disprove their theories. By the end of the course, not only do you know major dinosaur families like Saurischians and Ornithischians, but you also have a strong grasp on how to logically evaluate theories and data.

Even though the class sessions were recorded and even if you wrote everything he said word-for-word, he still doesn't stick to it and diverges on the quizzes.

Prof. Witters may not be teaching this course for much longer (if ever), so I'd recommend taking it sooner rather than later. The format of this course virtually was much different than it has been in the past... your grade was made up entirely of 9 weekly 15 question quizzes that were open book and open note, with the lowest quiz grade being dropped. We'd meet three times a week with Prof. Witters, who was a great lecturer but packed lots of material into a very short amount of time, so you had to be on top of your notes... lectures were recorded though, so you could always go back and look at stuff you missed. He offered office hours five days a week (during normal times it's 7 times!) in conjunction with weekly TA sessions, so take advantage of that time to ask questions. While Prof. Witters intimidating and sometimes can be passive aggressive, he really wants you to succeed. While the quizzes may be open book and open note, they are HARD and unforgiving, but fair. You have to stay on top of all the material, because the questions are loaded with ways to trip you up, but if you can work out some studying time (try to get a study group!), you can definitely succeed.

I was not scoring so well on them at first and Professor Witters was very helpful in encouraging me to go to office hours. They are super helpful, and you don't even have to ask questions, you can simply listen to what others ask.

You start out with cellular biology, move into genetics and reproduction, then human anatomy and biology. There are 3-4 lectures per week. In each lecture, you typically start out with a discussion about a certain biological system/concept and then move into diseases/disorders related to that system. This makes the lectures pretty content heavy, but they are recorded if you missed something and you want to go back. Overall, the content was really interesting and engaging, and we went into a good amount of detail despite covering such a broad range of topics. Professor Witters is genuinely really kind and wants you to do well. He provides office hours 5 days a week, as well as a weekend review session. The TAs were also really helpful. If you do end up taking the class, I can't recommend going to their review sessions enough. There are no midterms or final, only weekly online quizzes that you have 45 minutes to complete on the weekend. Although they are open note quizzes, you will not do well unless you study. The questions are sometimes very confusing unless you have engaged with the material. During the review sessions, the TAs are really good about hinting at tricky concepts that will show up on the quizzes. As long as you put time into understanding the lectures, it is very doable to do well in this class. You are able to drop your worst quiz grade as well.

He also uses blackboard more than any other professor I've ever had -- optional interesting readings, a message board where you can post questions (and he will respond within hours, sometimes minutes, if an exam is coming up), and blogs, where the class works together on a challenging problem of human biology. Your grade is four exams, non-cumulative, and weighted based on how many lectures each covers. Participation (the blog, discussion board, going to office hours) can boost your grade if you're borderline, but it's mostly the exams. The exams are challenging, but again, if you stay on top of the material and study as the course progresses you should be fine. There's also bonus on every exam, and he's very generous with partial credit. That said, if you don't know how to study, you might want to wait a year. I know I really would have struggled in it freshman fall, since I didn't know how to study for a college class. Bio 2 definitely isn't an easy class, but it's not nearly as hard as the reviews make it out to be provided you put in the work. Like I said, I haven't taken bio in 7 years and was fine (despite taking four classes this term). This really was one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth, with one of the best professors that teachers here.\"",

The material is interesting and Witters always tried to include the human aspect of the science we covered (makes sense since it's a human bio course). He uses the x hour every week, either for Q&A or a video. The videos were interesting and usually helped reinforce the material, but by the end of the term almost no one was coming. Witters is ALWAYS available. He is lightning fast responding on the Blackboard discussion board (which a ton of people use for questions) and he takes students to lunch every week. His office hours are extensive too and he podcasts all of his lectures. This class is wonderful but expect to study a ton. The course covers a buttload of material. The class also ends up being a weird mix of people - bio majors, premed upperclassmen reviewing for the MCATs, and freshmen who want to take a bio intro course. The annoying part if you're taking it as an intro class is that it's not a prereq for any other bio courses, so you'll still have to take bio 11 to take any future bio classes. Long story short: I liked this class a lot but if you take it expect to spend a lot of time memorizing.\"",

If you take advantage of all these resources and take the time to study the material, you will do well. That said, this class is not \"easy\" in the sense that you can get away with spending little time outside of class studying. A lot of review IS necessary (since exams test pretty specific details from lectures) and there IS a lot of material. However, all the topics were incredibly interesting and Prof. Witters did an amazing job synthesizing everything - he weaves history, music, art, and modern applications of science into every lecture.

While I could see the material being challenging for non-science majors/non-premeds, I encourage people to take it.

His dedication to undergraduate students is unheard of and you wonder how he has time for everything else he does on campus, like pre-med advising, teaching at the med school, and also having a family. He has office hours everyday, even weekends, and answers questions on the Blackboard discussion board within about an hour of you posting.

The material is fascinating, which is why I chose the class in the first place. I spent hours and hours each week studying the material, but the sheer volume of information is overwhelming. Unfortunately, since there is so much information packed in, I was forced to focus on studying and memorizing instead deeply understanding and focusing on the fascinating material. It is quite unfortunate that there is no introductory biology course. This class is geared toward biology majors or non-majors who already have significant backgrounds in the subject.

That being said, my opinion on this matter probably stems from the fact that I am inherently a science person, not a humanities or social science person. To me, this course seemed like a course in stamp-collecting, with pointless memorisation of anatomy, diseases, and symptoms with little scientific rigour in the explanation of those phenomena. I found myself simply MEMORISING information, instead of understanding the concepts and processes of human biology with any depth.

Mr Witters is a terrific prof, one of the best I've had. Easy to talk to, very available out of class, and in class he makes the lectures captivating and fun. And I'm an English major! I'd recommend this course to everyone.\"",

This class gives an interesting, informative overview of human biology, but really Witters is the reason everyone should take this class; he is just great. Plus, there is no work except to study for the 3 exams.\"",
            "review 225: \"02F with Lee Witters: I absolutely loved this class. Professor Witters is a wonderful lecturer who puts a great deal of thought and effort into the material he presents and how he presents it. He was always available for office hours and tried to make the material as comprehensible as possible for all involved. The weekly question and answer sessions were particularly helpful for clearing up anything that might not have been fully understood in class. Even the movies shown were helpful in better understanding the material. I'm definitely not a bio major, but I would recommend this class to anyone with even a mild interest in how the human body works. I initially took this in order to fulfill a distributive requirement, but now I'm extremely grateful for having taken this class. The material is interesting and very relevant. I could not have asked for a better experience. Take full advantage of all the resources offered by this class: office hours, Q&A sessions, movies, TA reviews, blackboard discussion board, and the classes themselves. I promise if you are even somewhat interested in the way the human body works, this class won't be too much work and you won't dread going to class or studying for it. Both bio majors and total non-science people rave about it. Take it and you won't regret it.\"",
            "review 226: \"02F with Lee Witters: Witters was a great prof, very receptive to questions. His lectures were well organized, and he spoke engagingly, using jokes and anecdotes. He had SO MANY office hours too! there should never be a problem with finding him. Outside of the class setting he is a great person too. For some reason though, i didn't like the class. It was a bit too much like some of the high school bio I had already done, and it really wasn't interesting. I think the class tries to cover too much material--consequentially, we covered a lot of subjects only superficially and I was left with a lot of questions that the course couldn't cover. Its a good class for someone interested in learning some basic biology, but it's not a supereasy class to get the SCI distrib in either.\"",
            "review 227: \"02F with Lee Witters: 5 star class. Lee Witters is great. He is hilarious and gives clear, interesting lectures. It is good information to learn, but it is a lot to memorize for the tests. I'd recommend it to anyone, even though i don't usually take science classes.\"",
            "review 228: \"02F with Lee Witters: Prof Witters is a great professor and gives great lectures. He is very helpful, and available outside of class often. There was a lot of material covered, and a big range topics but it was very interesting.\"",
            "review 229: \"02F with Lee Witters: Prof. Witters def made the course. His lectures were interesting and very thought out. You can tell that he's gone through the material quite a few times. Good for those looking to get a general overview of the human body and those non-science people who want an easy sci distrib.\"",
            "review 230: \"02F with Lee Witters: I'm sure all the other reviews have already trumpeted Witters' effective teaching style and his mastery of powerpoint, so I'll keep it short: To make a class of about 200 feel like a small lecture, that truly has to say something about the job that he does. As a non-major, I completely recommend this class (he also removes Bio Majors from the curve when calculating exam grades). If you still have an SCI to fill, take it the next time it is offered. Or just take it anyway.\"",
            "review 231: \"02F with Lee Witters: Prof. Witters is awesome. His class was definitely a lot of fun. I enjoyed his PP presentations. He picked music that was great, like \"Sexual Healing\" for the lecture on reproduction. It was a lot of fun, not a lot of work, and very interesting. I took this course because I heard he was a good professor and that certainly true! Take this course if you can, it's a blast.\"",
            "review 232: \"02F with Lee Witters: The course was more difficult than I expected it to be. It required a good amount of focus and attention to detail. The lectures covered many different topics which were sometimes hard to understand because they were unrelated. Though Witters says that he only emphasizes the \"big idea\" on his tests, you are required to memorize a great amount of detail because his exam questions were very specific. Basically you [are] expected to know everything about anything he covers. Witters and the graders are very picky about grading the exams. Though you might explain a concept well and accurately on the exam, if you don't use the key words that Witters expects you get little or no credit for your answer.\"",

It covers a very important subject, your body and your health, and is the only class at Dartmouth that is all about you. Professor Witters is a great lecturer, very accessable, and willing to do everything to help students succeed in this class. If I were choosing classes again for this term knowing what I know about the course, I would definitely take this course over again!\"",

            "review 235: \"01F with Lee Witters: Professor Witters is a great professor. He is excited about teaching and inspires the students to learn. The information itself was interesting but Witters made the course work. True, the course covers a lot of information and you have to go over the material everyday but Witters makes it a point to be available for his students. He has walk-in office hours on the weekend and loves to help his students one on one. Even if you don't love bio, you will love this course.\"",

Prof. Witters is fun, interesting, and has great AV stuff in his lectures. He's helpful, available, and definitely goes out of his way to help his students learn and to make things interesting and worthwhile.

            "review 240: \"01F with Lee Witters: Witters might be one of the most dedicated profs at Dartmouth. He does millions of other things, but his dedication to Bio 2 is incredible. He really wants everyone to understand the material, and this shows in his availability for office hrs (during the week and on sat+sun mornings) the material is interesting, and usually everyone ends up cramming before the exams. On the last exam there was a lot of material, and it can get annoying that he expects knowledge of small details on the exams. it's a great class (nice for showing the big picture of bio), and not too difficult if you put time in(obviously better if you do this gradually, but cramming can still get you a good grade). Witters is likely one of the best bio dept profs.\"",

I never had bio in high school and I ended up with a B+. There's really no excuse for not doing well since so many resources are available. Witters will help you in any way he can. He relates the lectures to very real-life issues, and manages to show a short movie about every other class. AND he gave us candy on Halloween. nice.\""

The amount of reading is fairly substantial, but not insane. What makes the class difficult is the density of the material, and the dryness of the reading. I'd much rather read a biology textbook than these technical \"novels\". The papers are very manageable, but the reading will definitely require your utmost concentration. The class has very little discussion and mostly lecture. Do not take this class if you do not have a strong interest in the subject.\""
