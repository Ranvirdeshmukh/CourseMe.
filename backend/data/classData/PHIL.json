She'd assign three readings and normally you'd choose two or one of them to write a \"best question\" about that could help guide the class discussion and it was the only homework of the week. Honestly, until the midterm happened (a 250 word abstract for your final paper) I forgot I was enrolled in three classes. The final was super simple, a 1500 word research paper on an interdisciplinary topic of your choosing. However, this class was heavily focussed more on the neuroscience aspect of defining the self and not that much on the philosophy. I think a lot of cogsci majors take this class or at least did this term, so be prepared to be lost in all of their technical jargon. Prof. Nizzi is super understanding and gets that not everyone is a neuro major so she is also really nice about it when you contribute just something anecdotal or philosophical to the discussion. I enjoyed the class, would recommend to someone looking to try out philosophy but who is traditionally a science-focused person. 7/10\"",

My issue with Nizzi is her grading style. Nizzi gives out near-100s on all her assignments, tells you not to worry about your grade, and then for some reason at the end of the course curves you down. After finishing the term with a 94.5% average, I somehow wound up getting an A- with no explanation given. In addition, after giving us our grades throughout the term, at the very end she went back and regraded a few assignments to lower our grades! I have never seen a professor do this \u2014 it's both inconsistent and incredibly unprofessional. She's a deceitful professor with respect to her grading system, so if you'd like good feedback on where your grade stands in the course, just be sure to avoid Nizzi's course!\""

William Ratoff explains so many things so clearly, and he obviously has a very good grasp on the issues in the contemporary philosophy literature of mind. That said, his stance on the issue was also clear (he is a materialist) which I disagree with. He is a bit morally weak. And I think his philosophical persuasion affects his treatment of people. Why engage if there is no meaning or if we have no free will? Although he is nice and polite, he is also a bit solipsistic. This course was divided into two parts: philosophy literature on the conceptual debates of dualism vs. materialism (David Chalmers, a dualist was the key figure) and then cognitive science papers on consciousness (much more materialistic). I felt like towards the end of the class several people just assumed materialism is right (including William), even though the first half of the class laid a very strong foundation for dualism. William is a very nice grader, and our workload was not that much at all. Two papers, a quiz, and participation. Course organization was effective as well.\"",

That said, my only real criticism is that he is a bit dismissive near the beginning of the course. By the end of the course, it's pretty clear that he (and his philosophical camp) have the stronger, albeit not bulletproof, argument. I have to agree with him that the other side sounds a bit foolish after synthesizing all the evidence from the course... More broadly, this was an excellent class with fair grading and a reasonable workload. The cognitive science material was difficult, but Ratoff's handouts are really helpful for filling in the parts you don't understand.\""

I'd recommend skimming the readings so you have something to say in class, but you generally had a lot of freedom in terms of your essay topics, so you don't have to do in-depth readings for everything. For grading, there were three essays and a participation grade. I thought that Walden graded everything pretty fairly, but he only rarely gave out high As on papers, so there wasn't much room for error if you were shooting for a solid A in the class. For the participation grade, seriously just show up to class every day on time and you'll get a high grade, even if you don't participate.

We also had 2 papers on the first 2 subjects which were each worth 40% (totaling to 80% - quite a hefty portion of your grade, and not necessarily graded easily). We had a discussion post due each week (totaling 9). Overall, the work load was super super manageable and very evenly spaced which was nice as I feel like many Dartmouth courses are backloaded. Honestly, I didn't do any of the readings for this course, except when it was time to write the papers. I then skimmed the readings for quotes. This meant that I spend 20 min per week on this class, and then when it came to write the papers, around 7 hours reading and writing. I started the first paper 6 hours before it was due (don't do this), but still ended up with 1 point below the high, and 2 above median.

I ended up really liking this format because you didn't have to slog through lectures and could digest the material at your own pace, and the discussion post format was relaxed and engaging. The course was split into three sections; Morality, Freedom, and The Mind, covering classics like Kant and Hume as well as some interesting contemporary philosophy from philosophers like Dennett and Ishmael. For two of the three topics you had to do a dialogue with a partner or a 2500-word essay, which means I didn't have to do anything for the last section which was definitely appreciated. I really gained an appreciation for the methodology and nuance behind philosophy, and its relevance today, especially how neuroscience informs the notion of free will.

True, Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre is probably the most difficult reading combo you can ever encounter in continental philosophy especially if you are not well-learned in the history of Western philosophy (in this case if you have not read much Kant and Hegel). However, the difficulty of Husserl and Heidegger was not much felt because the first half of the course was so well-equipped with excellent secondary sources and the classes being so well-taught, and to be honest we had few actual assignments that really engaged with Husserl and Heidegger's thoughts. The class was made rather difficult by the emphasis on Sartre and existential literature. Starting the second half of the course, we began reading Sartre's Being and Nothingness, without any secondary source to go along, and the teaching on Sartre was also not as well-broken-down and illuminating as on Husserl and Heidegger. With most of the graded assignments being applying Sartre to existential literature, analyses became muddy and difficult--as we did not even have a solid basic understanding of Sartre, applications of Sartre onto literature were easily erroneous.

We started out learning about Kant's theories on metaphysics, which went over my head even as a phil major, and class attendance dropped pretty quickly after that. I think Rosenkoetter may have struggled with the remote format and aired on the side of giving us way too much information, which was overwhelming at times. He posted several 1-2 hour lectures each week, on top of our class discussions and dense readings. On the plus side, Rosenkoetter was always super accommodating if you needed help or didn't understand the material, and he clearly knows more about Kant than anyone I've ever met.

The overall workload is very light, and I barely did any of the reading towards the end of the term.

I had never really ventured into philosophy before but this was a great experience. Projects were relatively easy and graded nicely. Bumpus gives very detailed and insightful essay comments so meeting with her to discuss them is a great way to set yourself up for success on essays.

She takes an eternity to grade things (she took like 5 weeks to grade a one page assignment), but it's all good. The class is basically a unit on abortion, euthanasia, and one of your choice. For the first two units, you draft an argument (numbered premise form), revise it, draft a paper defending it, and revise it. For the topic of your choice, you present and develop a project.

            "review 1: \"07F with Julia L.: This class was bearable, but disappointing as a 'culminating experience'. We read most of the second and all the third book of Hume's treatise, a companion book on Hume's morality, and various contemporary criticisms, defenses, and appropriations of Hume's moral psychology. The companion (by Baillie) was a good overview and made it almost unnecessary to actually read Hume to get by in the course. This is a testiment both to Baillie's ability to summarize and the difficulty of the course. I can't say that I was overly enthusiastic to take this course, but I figured it was the best of the three less-than-desirable seminar's offered by the department this year. Plus I like Hume and find his ideas interesting. This class, if anything, lessened any interest I had in Hume. I was not at all excited to do the readings (I usually am in phil classes). The class was discussion-based, though the discussions were rarely about any of the actual arguments or details and more about examples, counter-examples, and their applicability. This was mostly because Driver seemed incapable of guiding a discussion. She did hand out outline's for the day's discussion at the beginning of class, though these weren't terribly helpful. She seemed like she new the subject well though, if only from her perspective. In the end, I would avoid Driver for my seminar. It's too bad, because the class had lots of potential, both because of the subject and the ability of the other students in the class.\"",

The readings were a good tour of the important developments in virtue ethics (she did a good job of planning the readings or making us think she did, I suspect the former). We were assessed with three papers (3, 12, and 15 pages or something about like that). I found the grading generous; however, the median would suggest that this may not have been the case. Each day she gave us a handout which was of some (but not a lot) help. Lectures were ehh, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what the word is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Not horrible? They were slow, they lacked a cohesive line of interpretation, and only occasionally did they provide the background to really set up the reading for the day. That said as a rule we did manage to hammer our way through the key points. She always answered student questions, ALWAYS, without fail, no matter how stupid the question was. The class would have been better if she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done a little more to control discussion. I did about half of the reading and the class as a whole did almost none of the reading. This left for many awkward moments (and could explain the stupidity of many of the questions / comments). I think this review has very little to do with Phil 80 and more to do with what Driver is like in a 15 person class. While she will by no means go down as one of my best teachers at Dartmouth she stayed well away from the worst and if nothing else commands respect as a true expert in the field (to bad she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share that with us in a more organized fashion).\"",

I've never had a philosophy class with powerpoint, and I can't say that I really liked it that much. Crocker does engage the class on a regular basis (although sometimes the value of these discussions is questionable). A typical discussion: \"Would you twist a child's arm to save your 5 dying friends?\" and various answers from various students. My major gripe with this class was the choice of material covered. I don't know if it's taught differently with different profs, but this course was all about substantive ethics, mainly consequentialism and deontology (intuitionism). I don't really like either of these moral theories, and would have liked to discuss alternatives (Virtue ethics, any continental ethics, etc) and metaethical issues (the discussions and lectures rarely addressed the rather large and problematic assumptions about subjectivity, epistemology, psychology, etc made by most of the philosophers we read). The last third of the course is also devoted to Gert's common morality, which I found boring, unoriginal, and mostly a waste of time (which might be expected with a \"common\" morality).\"",
            "review 4: \"07S with John Crocker: Prof. Crocker cares a lot about students and wants to get to know them and teach them. Which is great. The problem is that this course meanders through consequentialism and deontology without any real organization or direction, looking at one philosopher per lecture and not really ever getting into the profound issues that *might* surround the idea of \"What is a good action?\" or \"What makes a good person?\" It's a very philosophical class--I would recommend it for someone who enjoyed other upper-level philosophy classes at Dartmouth- the discussions really focus on the logical aspects of ethical arguments and how they play off each other. There are some fun fanciful examples as well, and you'll learn some grammar too, because Crocker will take time out of the lecture to have a discussion about the use of \"which\" on at least 3 occasions. There is one 15-20 page paper. The directions for this paper are about as sparse as the ones I just gave you; that is, they don't exist: you write about what you want as long as he approves it. Which is nice. There's an in-class final, which I didn't enjoy, but it does make you realize that you learned something. Skim the readings to get a general idea and then take good notes in class, or get a study-buddy that took good notes--you won't need them until the final, but it's hard to remember all the details from long ago. If you need a TMV, take something else. If you're going to have a busy term but a lighter end of term, this is a good class for that. Oh, and there's a participation grade. I wish I had participated more now, because it hurt my grade that I didn't.\"",

In a certain sense and at certain times, it really felt like a stand-up comedian was teaching me philosophy. And what could possibly be cooler than that? What's the work like? Well, there were two papers, both of which asked to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the concepts in the readings which were explained/expanded upon in the lectures by applying them to related philisophical problems. They were very difficult to write but really force you to understand the material, since Kulvicki prohibits both directly quoting and paraphrasing the readings. As for the final, it was basically regurgitation - but because of the abstract and complex nature of the material, you really did have to know everything, even though the final didn't ask you to apply it in the same critical sense that the papers did. My only criticism of lectures would be that Kulvicki wants to make sure everyone understands, and predictably that meant that a few students basically used some classes as personal office hours.

If I hadn't already taken interesting courses with good professors in the philosophy department, I probably would have been completely turned off to the subject. The material could have been interesting, but class discussion and lectures made it nearly unbearable. If Professor Levey was not calling on the same people over and over again, he was lecturing about things that could have been explained with good and properly-guided class discussion. Rather than pointing students in the correct direction, leading towards good answers, he would call on several students just to tell them \"No, that's not it.\" That's just not how class discussion is supposed to be. Failing to guide his students well enough, he would descend into a long and boring lecture, during which interruptions (such as questions) were ignored completely. The few times that he did answer questions, he did so in an annoyed and antagonistic way. To make matters worse, Professor Levey was completely unavailable outside of class. I actually had a few experiences where I think he saw me and then did a 180 in the opposite direction. I can assure you that this has nothing to do with bad breath or any such thing, as other students in the class have recounted similar experiences. His office hours were very early in the morning on Monday, which, as you know, pretty much means \"Stay the hell away.\" If going in to meet your professor at 7:00 AM on a Monday morning doesn't work for you, I'm sure that you could just blitz him to request a different time, right? Fat chance. Professor Levey will most likely ignore your blitz. Don't bother blitzing him about anything, actually, because you won't receive a response, unless it's convenient for him. Whether it's a question about the material, about an assignment, or about a meeting, you're better off catching him in the two minutes or so it takes him to gather up all of his stuff and bolt out of the room after class without knocking over or sidearming any of his students. The reading for the course is extremely interesting. I suggest going to the library and picking up anything by Quine, Russell, Kripke, Frege, or Lewis. All of it is good. You'll get as much out of the material reading it on your own as you would by taking this course.

Crocker went deeper into the distribution of healthcare, abortion, human research, and euthansia that did Gert. Gert focuses more on his moral framework, consent, and competence. I, however, found the topics that Crocker focused on to be much more intriguing. In total, it was a very worthwhile course.\"",

We certainly talked about philsophical issues--most of the course was about hot-topic bioethical dilemmas like abortion, euthanasia but covered a lot of other things like confidentiality, competence, and how we should define 'malady'. From the outset, though, the course was taught presupposing professor Bernard Gert's ethical theory, which I found to be a little bit rankling, as I am not particularly a fan of that theory. I think it would have been useful to have more debate about the philosophical issues at hand, but then again this course was mostly for, I think, non-majors who just want to become familiar with the problems of medical ethics. So if that's what you're looking for, this course might be for you--if you're a major, then don't bother; the course will feel slow and low-level.\"",

As long as the directions are followed, all is well, but straying too far from his specifications will often land you a less-than-desired grade.

We debated interesting issues, the lectures were just right, and the exams were very, very fair. This class was not particularly difficult, since the reading was usually very well explained by Brison and a large amount of time was spent discussing the readings. The midterms and finals were essay based, and we had the questions in advance. Professor Brison gave us four potential questions of which two were picked, so if one did poorly on the exam, one has only oneself to blame.

Thus, there isn't as much discussion in this class as there is lecture, and the paper assignments are very specific and you have to write the right thing. That said, we did read Darwin and Freud, which was really interesting, and after writing the Freud paper, I really did feel like I understood Freud's theories, as incorrect as they happen to be.

It is also a bit difficult to be engaged with a professor who stutters and often changes topics abruptly mid-sentence and doesn't complete his thoughts.

That said, however, this course was often mind-numbing and incomprehensible due in part to the inaccessibility of the material (a LOT of Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche... we skipped Schopenhauer b/c we spent too much time muddling through Kant), but mostly to Prof. Rosenkoetter's rambling and incoherent lectures. Prof. Rosenkoetter is very knowledgeable in his field, but does a very poor job of disseminating that knowledge to his bewildered students. His tendency to go off on 30 minute tangents that did little to clarify any of the key concepts did not help my comprehension of the material. I often found that I could make more sense of Kant and Hegel by themselves than I could through Prof. Rosenkoetter's lectures -- I'm pretty sure that's not how it's supposed to be. In addition, Prof. Rosenkoetter deviated wildly from the syllabus (and the ORC), as we spent more than half the term on Kant, when this class was intended to survey the post-Kantian aftermath. By the time the drop deadline came, we still had no grades in the class by which to judge our progress. Some students took the final exam without having received their first paper back. All in all, this course was a wasted 10 weeks. The material is incredible, and it is unfortunate that for me, at least, it remains largely incomprehensible.\"",

If you've had some philosophy the material isn't too hard even to learn on your own, but I suspect Rosenkoetter contributed more to our understanding that the critical reviewers on this site even gave him credit for. There's simply no way to lay out the premises of each argument in the Critique of Pure Reason and hope to finish on time- so Rosenkoetter trusted that if we needed such guidance we would do it on our own. Also, it's hard to give an especially structured lecture on the material- and Rosenkoetter is wonderful at taking a particular student's question and understanding just how he (or she) doesn't understand the material, and incorporating that into his general explication, since he is so very damn familiar with the texts we read. A little practice and the course will be first rate. The timing is the main issue that should be worked on.\"",

The papers were all just based on 1 specific reading (well there were choices) so it was actually not necessary to do the reading for class. It did annoy me that participation/attendance did not count in the grading, since I went to most classes and there were some who never came, although using the handouts she gave out daily were helpful in writing the papers. The material in the class was interesting at first but by the end it seemed really repetitive- we went over the same examples in every class and lectures were often dry. But on the other hand, Professor Driver was very nice and definitely knew what she was talking about- she made the often dense-in-ideas readings easy to understand, and her grading on the papers was not hard.

It was a shame, because from what I did hear from other students during the discussions I think that there was a wide diversity of opinion, which could have made for some very interesting discussions. Unfortunately, the discussions were never student-to-student: they were always student-to-Crocker. In a 10A class, this pattern got pretty boring after a while.

Lectures: were interesting, sorensen sometimes seemed to direct conversation almost too directly towards his next point, and I would think we were discussing a tangent until suddenly he produced a very topical transparency for the overhead. The downside was that the lectures didn't really seem to teach according to an organized curriculum... as this is my first philosophy course, maybe this is typical, but the lack of continuity affected my ability to remember material, sometimes even just days after the class... this was probably also due to the fact that the papers, although on very interesting topics (I enjoyed thinking about all of them) did not necessarily require a general understanding of class or book material. Since they were responsible for 100% of your grade in the class, this obviously posed little incentive to do the readings or pay attention unless you were genuinely interested. On the plus side: Sorensen is interesting in class, and often funny. He is clearly very intelligent, and knows his stuff. This made his criticisms of our papers typically accurate and difficult to defend, although this made the papers more interesting to write and revise. One last negative: Although Sorensen was definitely concerned that we learn to write well in a philosophical or logical fashion, he was not really worried at all about teaching us how to write well in the general sense. (I think he mentioned something to that effect the first day of the class)... since I viewed this as my \"last chance\" to receive this sort of criticism before being subjected to (probably) much more critical professors later at Dartmouth, I felt that my writing would have benefited more from just about any other seminar.\"",

I found the books interesting, but they were rarely discussed in class and held no relevance to the papers. The real problem, however, was Prof Sorensen. He is a genius in this field (published in many journals, etc.), yet he lacks the ability to effectively communicate in an acceptable fashion and his comments on papers. I did visit office hours, and perhaps he considered himself \"brutally honest\", but he was disrespectful and inappropriate. After one such encounter, I lost all interest in the course.

At 4:45pm the day you take each quiz you can go look at your score and discuss any questions you have with your TA, which is incredibly helpful. Quizzes are a surprisingly effective method of getting you to learn the material, and I think the structure of the class is the best possible way for learning basic logic. As for the material of the class, it is like math but doesn't make you deal with numbers. Most of it is using systems of logic to write proofs, which forces you to think in a very specific way and I think is very valuable for people interested in math and writing and just arguing in daily life. I actually ENJOYED doing practice problems for this class. It was a study break from other classes :) If you work fairly hard and stay on top of your work, you will do well - the prof tells you how many points you can miss over the course of the term in order to get each grade, so you know how you stand throughout the course. Also satisfies your QDS!\"",

As said this class has a unique format where there is an optional lecture on Monday and three attempts to pass each weeks quiz on Tues, Wed, and Fri, as well as a midterm and final. For each week, you are supposed to read a ~30 page textbook chapter and then come to class as many times as you need to pass the weeks quiz. You are able to move on to the next quiz after you are satisfied with your grade on the current quiz. One student apparently got so far ahead they finished the course on week 5. I found the class required about 8 hours per week reading each textbook chapter and doing practice questions and about 2 attempts to secure a high grade on quiz. Earlier weeks in the course required less time and later weeks required more. I took CS 30 before this course, so weeks 1 and 2 were basically review for me. The last few weeks of the course involved somewhat challenging proofs, which required me to put a few extra hours in doing practice questions from the textbook. I enjoyed much of the class, as we did many proofs and it was very satisfying when I figured out a proof. Moor was retiring that year and the course had some management issues. Twice no TAs showed up to proctor a day's quiz and all of he students were forced to wake up for the 9S for no reason.\"",

            "review 8: \"05S with James Moor: I have a feeling a lot of people really struggled with the class. There were a lot of drops late in the term. If you dont like/arent good at math then this class is probably not for you. If you are a phil major and dont like math/arent good at it, well too bad or dont be a phil major because logic is essential for the study of philosophy. The course itself is great because it's more or less self-paced. You get to take quizes on any of three or four days a week and only the highest score you receive counts towards the grade you get for the chapter. But outside of the self paced-ness there's still a schedule, which was one chapter a week. It was actually pretty demanding considering that the skills can take a long time to master, as they can get pretty abstract: there's nothing but theory and abstract mechanical operations here. But if you take it for what it is and do the work in the book the quizes are fair enough, though sometimes focusing on some really obscure detail from a given chapter. Professor Moore is a really nice person but unfortunately he's not too effective. He's not too rigorous because he's trying to make logic more appealing and 'cool' or something: he caters to the mediocre philosophy student too much and looses a lot of the essential elements that those mediocre students would really benefit from seeing. He also often misses stuff in lecture that needs more explanation and then has a lot of typos in his slides and even textbook that I know confuses people. I honestly got more help from the TA's who really cater to individuals well in the discussion sections. But all that professor stuff is ok because there's only one lecture a week and honestly a lot of the course time is spent alone, at night, with your logic text book, and dressed like the grimmreaper guy on the cover.\"",

Interesting for those who are considering making logic or philosophy a significant part of their Dartmouth experience, but if you're just tangentially interested in systematized logic, I would say you might as well teach it to yourself and save the course time/credit for something it's harder to teach yourself.\"",

For example: - Philosophy Majors - People who need their QDS and don't want to take math - People who like mathematical problem solving but are not calculus-savvy in the least - People who want to seem cool by saying \"I study formal logic\" The course structure can be confusing to explain electronically. I recommend if you have interest that you get in touch with either the professor, a TA, or a student who took the class. That said, the structure is as follows: - Self-paced class. You read, then take quizzes. - Only the highest quiz for your unit counts (you could get zeros on the other ones if you wanted, or just not take them) - Three quizzes are offered in that unit's week. - If you have gotten above a 95 on a certain unit's quiz, you can advance to the next unit's quiz if you so choose to (and so, enable yourself to have four or more chances to do well) If you take this class, I highly recommend taking all the quizzes and going to all the review sessions. Find out what you did wrong on your quizzes at the review sessions. You can use the TAs to find out useful tips and tricks for how to improve. I personally went to nearly all of the quizzes - my first of the week normally was fail, the second was normally a 70 or 80, and the third almost always a solid A.

Professor Bumpus did a lot to help those who needed it understand the material. The tests were very fair and I found the entire course to be fascinating. Now, the LARGE negative of the class. The TAs were almost NEVER on time, and they proctor the entire show. This resulted in the nearly the ENTIRE CLASS showing up for a test, and not having it administered. This was a particularly difficult test, and many people had studied long and hard. This was a large sticking point for many students, and I wouldn't doubt you seeing this same line of comment in their reviews. The TAs were also nowhere near as good at explaining the material as the Professor, so without personally slighting them, I'd have to say they did not offer a single useful thing to the class, other than being able to grade our papers quickly.

He had an outline of the day's lecture that he stuck to pretty strictly and was easy to listen to. He also wrote the textbook, so it was helpful to do the reading. We had 4 tests (non-cumulative) that were multiple choice, identification, and short answer, and a 4-5 page essay at the end of the term. You definitely need to study for the tests as they can get tricky, but if you do the reading, example problems from the book, and go over notes, you should be fine. It's pretty straightforward, especially for a Philosophy course. Take it!\"",

            "review 5: \"07F with Walter P.: Professor Armstrong, or Walter as he wants us to call him, was an absolutely incredible professor. His 3 50-minute lectures every week, while unnecessary to learning the material (something he already knows and told me so personally), were always fun and delivered with an energy and enthusiasm that kept me coming to every single one. If you wanted, you could read Walter's textbook and get the handouts online, but then you'd have missed out on the class's best aspect, which is the prof himself. He made logic enjoyable with his creative examples, and nothing beat those classic video lectures. He was always available during office hours, and before a quiz or a paper I found going to him with questions was a very helpful resource. The quizzes were difficult and covered a lot of material, and the 2 papers on god and abortion were ridiculously hard, so for 5 days during the term my life was entirely consumed with this class. But other than those 5 days I rarely did anything for it except attend the lectures. If you are willing to study hard and work for 5 days then I certainly recommend this class for its practical value and for the prof. Unlike other philosophy courses, this one definitely has practical application in everyday life and it has improved my ability to argue effectively. I loved this class and don't regret taking it during my freshmen fall. Coming to Dartmouth I didn't expect to find a professor as eccentric as Walter, and I'm definitely going to miss his crazy hair and rotation of the same two sweaters over and over again.\"",

The reading is essentially optional during the entire class, and the quizzes that arise every now and then are easy if you just pay attention in class and attend the discussion section right before the quiz. The Prof. wrote the book the class uses the entire time, so the lectures are basically repeats of what you read the previous night. The discussion sections are similarly useless, except the week before the quiz, as they don't add anything new to what you already learned and often revolve around re-doing exercises in the book which were suggested in the first place. Once I stopped doing the reading, the lectures got better, as the professor hands out an outline of his talking points and speak effectively to the class, without making it feel as though he is talking at you. The class helped me learn some interesting material for other classes, and probably improved my writing. Overall, a good class.\"",

He basically repeats and clarifies the reading from the night before, as he wrote the book you use, but lecture is still useful. Hes available during his office hours and is always willing to help you argue out your points for any papers, or to clarify anything for your quizzes. Quizzes are also more like mini-midterms as theyre worth 20% of your grade, which is a little misleading. You only get two papers, however, and they are graded somewhat harshly (in some ways because they are on controversial topics and thus your argument, which you are graded on, can never be perfect). The sessions with the TA's during discussion sections are very useful, as it is very helpful having someone explain the exercises in the book and to facilitate discussions about your paper topics. The course as a whole has definitely made me a better arguer, something which is valuable for anyone writing a persuasive paper or considering a career where one has to be a good arguer.\"",

I sometimes found the book easier to understand than his lectures, which made class kind of pointless at times. Additionally, the first half of the class requires very logical thinking, similar to a math class, in which you learn the patterns of arguments and take tests of these patterns. The second half of the class requires you to write argument papers. This is probably the more difficult part, as applying all the previously learned techniques is more challenging than it appears to be.

The huge plus about his method was his handouts: they were excellent and helped a huge deal when studying for the quizzes. Some additional notes: -This is not the course to take if you have never taken philosophy before and think that you are going to hear about \"the meaning of life\" or \"the nature of reality\". This course presents the technical tools of philosophy (logic) and gives them to the students so that they can argue for themselves and present THEIR own views. Be ready to think on your own and defend your own position because there will not be any spoonfeeding of views in this course. -The 3 quizzes are on tecnical logic and will require from the students quite a bit of independent practice and discipline to prepare.

The lectures given by the other professors (about 40-50% of the lectures) were a little less informative and a lot less authoratative. It's definitely unsettling when the professor has trouble answering what are supposed to be simple questions about reasoning and logic. Even with that downside, this class is worth taking if you have any interest in how lines of reasoning are constructed and arguments are put forth.

Prof. Sinnott-Armstrong's lectures were generally good, he communicated the material effectively and usually made it interesting. Prof. Roskies' lectures were almost always boring and too slow-paced. She was not good at communicating the ideas behind what she was teaching, and even worse at answering questions. Several times during class she was completely stumped by a student's question or failed to understand the question at all, and had to be saved by Prof. Sinnott-Armstrong. She was also my discussion leader, and usually at the end of the discussion group the students were much more confused than when we went into the class. In her defense, it seemed like she was being forced to teach something that was obviously not her area of interest or expertise.

The material was pretty standard intro to logic stuff, probably worth knowing if you've never taken any classes on logic before. Overall, not a great class.

Those are indeed the goals of the course, but if you get lazy--like me--you won't get anywhere. In theory, I should have done a lot more outside work and engaged with the professors during office hours. The lectures will always be a near line-by-line review of the reading in \"Understanding Arguments.\" That's a fact and probably won't change. \"Understanding Arguments,\" however, is a fabulous textbook, with lots of examples and speeches on which you can hone your skills (in your own spare time, that is). Perhaps the discussion sections should have focused more rigorously on going over practice speeches and examples; in reality, they were really only helpful as quiz reviews. The courseload is pretty light, with four quizzes and one final paper, in which you have to argue whether or not God exists, whether machines can think, or whether affirmative action is constitutional. If you are unsure about your argument or how to write a phil paper, go to office hours! I didn't get help, and my paper grade will definitely suffer for it. Sinnott-Armstrong is a great lecturer; Adina Roskies is nice and incredibly intelligent, but her lectures were weaker.

Most times, you can probably just get away with either reading the book or going to lectures - but be sure to do the exercises in the book instead of just glancing over them. The tests are not too difficult, but they are extremely detail-oriented and do tend to test on the \"borderline\" cases of the concepts.

We talked about whether machines can think, if god exists, and if affirmative action is constitutional. Usually, i hate thinking about these things because i can never determine an answer and get frustrated, but it was actually really cool because you were presented with frameworks of how great philosphers have approached the subjet over time, and it forces you to think about one topic, which is actually pretty cool. overall, an easy course that is fun and worthwhile.\"",

Professor Sinnott-Armstrong will probably be one of my favorite professors at Dartmouth when I've finished my four years here. (I can't say for sure, as I'm only a freshman, of course.)

Professor Ellis was the weakest of the three, in my opinion, but by no means was he awful -- he was just in very good company. His lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, as he would contradict himself or accidentally say something when he meant something else. However, he made himself available outside of class and was more than willing to go over material until we understood it. Professor Hanson is another very, very talented lecturer. He uses precise language and organizes his thoughts in such a way that makes everything he says perfectly clear. He exudes enthusiasm for the subject and keeps you on your toes. Workload-wise, there are readings every night, which are interesting and very painless. Within the readings are exercises that one may either do or not do -- I suggest doing them because they're good preparation for the quizzes... and are just fun, besides. There are three quizzes and a final, as well as a final 5-6 page argumentative paper. I absolutely loved this course.

A word of advice: avoid him. Professor Sinnott-Armstrong has established for himself a wonderful reputation as a friendly scholar. He wrote the textbook in conjunction with one other Dartmouth prof., and he knows his material (and that of other professional philosophers, even modern) extremely well. It wasn't as though he had a revelation one day and wrote a book; he's organized, intelligent, and quite insightful. Professor Ellis seemed to me as the nervous type at the beginning of the course; I came in two weeks late, and attended his first lecture as my first. After I got past the pacing, I realized that what he was saying made a lot of sense. I particularly enjoy his lecturing style because he seems to reach out to the students in a way that neither Sinnott-Armstrong nor Hanson can. He even arranged for his office hours to be held at Rosie's Caf\u00e9; if you understood the paradoxes from class, he bought you coffee and dessert! :o) I also had Ellis for my discussion group, and I think I best understood the material afterwards as opposed to after class or the reading.

Aside from discussion sections, I don't really understand why the course merited three professors,but all three were very accessable and helpful. Ellis was a very weak lecturer, but he is in his first year teaching, so I would expect him to improve by the next time this course comes up. There is not a whole lot of philosophical readings, the course focuses mainly on learning proper logic and presentation of valid arguments.

This class was a layup in the sense that the workload was light and the grading was fair/easy. The concepts could be tricky, but Kulvicki was always willing to help. The course material is inherently difficult to explain and digest, but Kulvicki did as good of a job as possible making it understandable. If you make the effort to participate in class and spend 10 minutes looking at the readings beforehand, you will be able to understand the concepts without any outside work. Kulvicki spends the majority of every class answering questions about the material. We learned some other things, but the only topics that we were tested on were deductive logic and basic probability. If that sounds interesting to you then you will like the class, otherwise it will be tolerable. The pace of the class was slow and the work was extremely light, though he was teaching a scaled-back version of the class designed for the pandemic and has stated that he will be adding some more material in the future. We had only 4 assignments the entire term, and each made up 25% of the grade: two take home assignments (one less than 1000 words and one about 2000 words that was the final) and two in class quizzes that are curved up to around a B+ median. The two quizzes were on deductive logic and probability, and the papers involved applying those concepts to recent op-eds. If you understand the concepts, which you will if you pay attention in class, the work is not at all difficult. If I remember correctly, attendance was not mandatory.\"",
            "review 4: \"20F with John Kulvicki: I think most of the bad reviews for Kulvicki stem from people assuming the class is a layup. It's not too difficult by any means but it's definitely not easy if you haven't been exposed to the topics in formal logic before (which I assume not many people have) Most of the learning is done on your own but Kulvicki chose some really interesting texts to look at the topics at different angles - some more technical and others more conceptual and informal. I wasn't able to keep up with all the readings because of my courseload this term but if you find yourself in that position, his notes and videos which he prepared for the class narrow down all the info you'll need for quizzes and assignments. The actually class was just spent asking him questions but it's rare that we'd ever get into anything technical - they are mostly broad conceptual stuff which actually mightn't be useful if you're just straight out looking for help in answering a formal question. That being said Kulvicki has no problem walking through something with you if you ask. Come with prepared questions to make your experience and everyone else's better. DO ALL THE PRACTICE QUESTIONS. He posts detailed enough solutions but only look at them after you wrestle with the notes and questions because there isn't really much more practice available other than what he provides.

This class was HARD. The first three weeks are easy. Everyone really understands everything, and it's really simple (writing out statements in the logic shorthand). After the first quiz, everything becomes a mess. My tutor had absolutely no idea what I was talking about when I asked her about begging the question and showed her examples of validity; I don't blame her though, because none of this stuff was covered in the class last time it was offered. These concepts, according to her, were extremely harder than anything she had experienced in her class (which she referred to as a layup). Kulvicki is a great guy. He is very funny and very patient in office hours. That being said, his lectures are hard to follow. Usually, he'll get started, and then one person will ask a question, and then the class will stay stuck on that example for the entire class, and the rest of the lecture will be left out of class. I learned a lot during office hours when people focused on the material more, but during class, any question would entirely derail the lecture, which was very frustrating. There are usually daily readings of different philosophers, which are sometimes covered in class that day, but other than that, there is minimal work besides studying. I learned some things from this class, sure. But it definitely caused me more stress than was necessary, and it was not what I thought I signed up for. Towards the end, it was literal math. Like, formulas and calculating probability with fractions and things. Definitely didn't expect that in philosophy. Either way, Kulvicki is a great guy, just needs more structure in his class.

Most of the time spent in class was students arguing Kulvicki trying prove him wrong. The first midterms were the most ridiculous tests I have ever seen. Even if you had a good argument in your answer, you could miss every single point because it wasn't the exact response he wanted to see. Being a philosophy class, there should be more than one right answer, especially if you have a good argument. I showed the tests to one of my friends and she just laughed. He purposely put questions on them trying to confuse the class and knowing that we would miss them. The third half of the class was purely elementary level statistics. If you had not taken AP statistics in high school you probably wouldn't understand what was going on. The teacher tried to flex his knowledge and Princeton degree on the class and acted like he superior to everyone in the class. I honestly thought he was making up everything that he taught us as class went on. The readings were boring and mostly irrelevant. If you are looking for a good third class or a layup this is not the class. Also, if you can avoid it, NEVER take a class with Kulvicki.

On one of our quizzes that was particularly difficult (and not based on what we had learned) he told us there was no way we could have done that bad if we had tried so he lowered the median from a B+ to a B. I tried to go to office hours and he told me he didn't understand how I could possibly not understand, I basically started to cry and he did not acknowledge it. It was completely random who did well on the quizzes. They were each 20% of our final grade and were out of 40 points. He would put a complicated statement and then say, is this logical? The yes or no answer would be 6 points and an explanation would be another 6. If you guessed wrong, you basically lost 12 points out of 40. But, even if I got the question right, I without fail lost points on the question anyways. In the beginning, the class discussions seemed engaging, but by the end, it consisted of people asking questions and we would go on tangents that were in no way relevant.

Plus the course is very lighthearted and funny, it doesn't take itself that seriously, which makes it a lot easier to bear mentally. All-in-all, it was a good and easy and interesting course, one which I wish I had given more attention to. I highly reccomend it as a third course.\"",
            "review 4: \"05F with Adina Roskies: This class was like death in a box. The professors all gave bad lectures that were impossible to follow, and were generally boring. The textbook is fine, and the examples explain the material in the book, but there is an awful correspondence between the examples in the books and the examples on the test, such that it is impossible to prepare properly. When the professors gave a ridiculously hard exam, they literally blamed the class for not studying hard enough, when in reality they were not teaching hard enough. I found 2 of the 3 professors to be rude and obnoxious when I spoke to them outside the classroom. It completely turned me off to the philosophy department. While the material itself is milllldly interesting and useful, these profs were not. oh, and they called the x-hour every week, which was also a huge pain.\"",
            "review 5: \"04F with Walter P.: This class has incredible potential. I came in expecting I'd become proficient at breaking down and evaluating people's arguments. Those are indeed the goals of the course, but if you get lazy--like me--you won't get anywhere. In theory, I should have done a lot more outside work and engaged with the professors during office hours. The lectures will always be a near line-by-line review of the reading in \"Understanding Arguments.\" That's a fact and probably won't change. \"Understanding Arguments,\" however, is a fabulous textbook, with lots of examples and speeches on which you can hone your skills (in your own spare time, that is). Perhaps the discussion sections should have focused more rigorously on going over practice speeches and examples; in reality, they were really only helpful as quiz reviews. The courseload is pretty light, with four quizzes and one final paper, in which you have to argue whether or not God exists, whether machines can think, or whether affirmative action is constitutional. If you are unsure about your argument or how to write a phil paper, go to office hours! I didn't get help, and my paper grade will definitely suffer for it. Sinnott-Armstrong is a great lecturer; Adina Roskies is nice and incredibly intelligent, but her lectures were weaker. I had Adina for my discussion section; she was nice but didn't seem to have a great handle on the material. I'd recommend Sinnott-Armstrong as a discussion leader.\"",

I had her as my section leader and she was pretty knowledgeable as well, thgouh not as well-organized as sinnott-Armstrong. Try to get into his discussion group, or Adina's if you can. I liked the class because its very logical and makes sense and if you do the practice questions in the book you'll generally be prepared for the quizzes. They do a great job getting you ready for the quizzes by having discussion groups just before the quiz so you can ask any questions and do practice problems ahead of time plus its workth taking the class just to see the funny movies!! haha!!!\"",
            "review 10: \"04F with Walter P.: This class was actually taught by two professors, Prof. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, and Prof. Adina Roskies. The lectures were divided approximately evenly between the two of them, and the discussion sections were divided between them and a third professor. Prof. Sinnott-Armstrong's lectures were generally good, he communicated the material effectively and usually made it interesting. Prof. Roskies' lectures were almost always boring and too slow-paced. She was not good at communicating the ideas behind what she was teaching, and even worse at answering questions. Several times during class she was completely stumped by a student's question or failed to understand the question at all, and had to be saved by Prof. Sinnott-Armstrong. She was also my discussion leader, and usually at the end of the discussion group the students were much more confused than when we went into the class. In her defense, it seemed like she was being forced to teach something that was obviously not her area of interest or expertise. The saving grace of this class was that the text was written by Prof. Sinnott-Armstrong, so everything that he taught was almost word-for-word from the book, and everything on the exams and the final paper was taken straight from the book. The material was pretty standard intro to logic stuff, probably worth knowing if you've never taken any classes on logic before. Overall, not a great class. It's a fairly easy class if you need to get rid of a distrib, or if you want just a tiny taste of philosophical logic and reasoning.\""
