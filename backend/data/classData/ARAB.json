To be fair, this class apparently was easy in prior terms, but it seems that the college has cracked down. There are two things that make this class a nightmare. First, there are now four 3-4 page response papers (10% each) that you have to do, which weren't present in prior terms of this course. The mere presence of that work is annoying, but what really makes it shit is the second problem: Kadhim no longer grades any of the work himself. He has outsourced the work to bitchy grad school TAs (yeah go fuck yourself AC '21) who love nothing more but to arbitrarily take off points whenever they can. As such, you essentially have to write full-fledged literary analyses of the books, which in turn, requires you to actually read the books in critical detail. Kadhim himself is also the most boring lecturer I've ever had---his slow, slurred speech makes you want to fall asleep. His lectures are essentially just plot summary of the books, which doesn't give you deep enough details to write the literary analyses the TAs want. And, if you try to contribute to the class, he will often make fun of you for not \"speaking loud enough\" (I think Kadhim has hearing problems? Well, that should be his problem, not the students'.) Oh, and attendance is mandatory and 20% of your grade, so you have to come to class. The final 15 page paper (40%) is the most excruciating paper I've ever written. The only positive things I'll say about this course is that there are no exams (which, to be fair, certainly matters to some people) and that you can 'skip' one of the books (there are 5 books---Kanafani's Men in the Sun, Khedairi's A Sky So Close, Mahfouz's Midaq Alley, Mahfouz's The Thief and the Dogs, Salih's Season of Migration to the North---but only 4 required response papers.) Please, if you need the LIT distrib, find a different class. Kadhim is NOT it.\""

There were many days when I could hardly will myself out of bed, despite having the awesomest drill instructor ever. There were many nights where I stared at the drills and wondered why exactly it was necessary to fill in the blank -- why not let us do some freewriting with the vocab? Why not have the prof make assignments outside of the textbook? As for the class and the material itself, the vocabulary is ridiculous. I'm very angry that I still cannot say that I like cats better than dogs. I can however discuss my embarassment at having few romantic relationships. That's potentially worthwhile, sort of.

            "review 8: \"05W with Diana Abouali: I liked Arabic much better winter term than fall term. We actually started to learn to understand & say things (a little bit - more on that later), which was much more interesting and rewarding than just learning the alphabet. It was also really nice to get Fridays off, occasionally. Morning people will never understand how hard it is to get up for 9:00 class every morning, let alone Drill. This is really not that difficult a class if you do all the work. Taking time on the homework helps a lot - it really does its job, which is to teach vocab and grammar. The tests definitely got harder this term, however. Just a tip - literally pulling all-nighters before tests is a bad idea, 'cause then you fall asleep during the tests, which is definitely not helpful for grades. I wish she would keep the tests at a consistent difficulty instead of varying them so much. That said, I didn't spend nearly as much time as I should have on Arabic this term, so any bad grades I got were deserved. What really bugs me is that we're definitely not developing any sort of fluency in spoken Arabic. It's true, drill is pretty pointless. It may help with vocab memorization, but it doesn't teach us to speak. And in class, we should spend a lot more time speaking & less time going over grammar exercises that we could do just as well for homework. The other foreign language classes are taught in the language by this point, & people in Japanese & Chinese are actually able to speak them. She could teach in Arabic & it would be hard for a while, but we'd pick up a lot more oral comprehension. (OK, I admit, grammar explanations would need to be in English, but other stuff could be in Arabic.) I'm kinda disappointed 'cause I expected to be able to say something in Arabic by the end of this year & now I don't think I will. However, overall, it is a good course. Prof. Abouali really knows what she's teaching, does a good job explaning it, & is extremely willing to meet with students outside of class. The class also got more fun this term. The skits & breakfasts were cool. It's a good foundation in Modern Standard Arabic. I'm just convinced that to actually become fluent, you'd have to take some Arabic outside of Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 9: \"05W with Diana Abouali: The second quarter of Arabic was very much different from the first. We really delved into grammar, although much of the grammar came with vocabulary lists. The problem was that the vocab still wasn\u2019t the most practical, although we did eventually learn things like telling time and days of the week, in addition to the past tense. Diana is still not doing a great job with making the class varied and creative, although we have had two Middle Eastern food days, albeit both during x-hours. The class has a pronounced lack of cultural material, and the sparse examples of culture we get through video clips or a few minutes of Arabic television do not suffice. The tests definitely got harder this quarter, and a bit schizophrenic, as the tests would seemingly vary between doable and really hard. She also started doing pop quizzes, but eventually told us in advance so we\u2019d actually have time to study. In class, Diana still has trouble explaining some of the main concepts in a way that is easily understood by non-native speakers. Sometimes I think she just expects that the rules make sense. I WISH SHE WOULD\u2019VE EXPLAINED THINGS IN CLASS LIKE SHE DID AT THE REVIEW SESSION BEFORE THE FINAL. CLEAR, CONCISE, TO THE POINT. I have to give her some slack since the book is pretty poorly structured, so that we get little tastes of a variety of grammar subjects without understanding many of these concepts in depth (the book constantly says, \u201cAccept this for what we tell you it is for now, even though it is confusing, because eventually you will learn the concepts in depth\u201d). SO, you kinda have to accept that you will be confused about a lot of things for a while and you definitely have to be ready to make mistakes. Drill. DRILL! AGH! First, Diana fired our drill instructor who\u2019s Palestinian and could thus teach us real pronunciation, although he sometimes confused us with Colloquial. She was just too much of a stickler with him. The next drill instructor we got was kind and patient, but she was really lacking on the creativity scale, probably because, as a third year student, she is scared of being hurt in her class for being out of the box in drill. The drill needs a more varied structure. If I can do my homework and repeat drill phrases at the same time, the drill is not challenging me and not improving my speaking skills. THERE NEEDS TO BE ACTUAL INTERACTION IN DRILL, NOT JUST MINDLES REPITITION!!! Get over the hype of the damn Rassias method and just do what works for your specific students!\""

Kadhim's philosophy is that the best way to learn a language is through hearing it in in class - as such, he pretty much conducts the class entirely in arabic. While this does admittedly have its benefits, given that this is still an introductory arabic class, he really needed to devote more time to actually explaining the concepts. Our only real reference for grammar was the book Al Kitaab text book which oftentimes did an inadequate job of explanation. I would say my biggest criticism of Kadhim however is his general approach. He wants us to learn the language, but he gave staggeringly little effort to actually make the class interesting and enjoyable. What's more - he would often express visible frustration, and although some of my classmates did not share this perspective, outward hostility towards you when you didn't understand a concept or made a mistake. I found the entire environment pretty somber, intimidating, and just plain not fun. I had Smolin first trimester and he made the class considerably more enjoyable. All this being said, he is an incredibly easy grader. We didn't really have any real tests: we had one xeroxed copy of a drill from the book, an in-class arabic recitation that simply required memorization of a paragraph, and a ridiculous final that was three pages long.

She varies from the book a lot, but it's really useful for better understanding how the language works. Expect a lot of homework and long tests, but nothing is really hard or unexpected. She also like to make class more fun by adding little elements of culture and expect to do a lot of one on one dialogues with classmates.\""

Highly recommend this class\""

            "review 1: \"22F with El Mostafa Ouajjani: I think all the other reviews speak for this class. Prof Mostafa is such a sweet prof and he shows that he cares so much about his students and wants them to learn. You start by learning the alphabet then move on to learning vocab and grammar. Besides the midterm and final, most of the assessments are quizzes, and he goes over the structure before you take them. As long as you do the daily homework and occasionally a little extra review of vocab and grammar, you will be absolutely fine in this class!\"",

I loved this class, and he is really funny and a very good teacher. His daily homeworks are not bad at all, basically guaranteed full marks as long as you tried to complete it correctly. His quizzes and midterms are very good and fair, and he definitely prepares you for it well. I highly recommend you taking Arabic 1 if you are interested in learning the language. P.S. I heard that Professor Jamila is also a wonderful professor from all my friends. You can't really go wrong with either.\"",

Made a lot of friends with everyone and was a fun place to joke around. Professor Mostafa is so kind and gave us sweets once. Many people think that Arabic is hard but Mostafa made it easily understandable by breaking it up. Be prepared to learn lots of vocabulary though and having to apply it by recording yourself read and doing group projects. There are a lot of partner activities so don't be afraid to branch out to some of your classmates.\"",

There are daily homeworks but they aren't graded harshly and you can miss a couple and still be fine. Occasional presentations/quizzes but they are never graded so as to punish you. Only downside is drill 4x a week (mine was at 7:45) and the daily homeworks can get annoying sometimes. Still highly recommend!!\"",

Super nice prof, accessible during office hours, dedicated to students in and beyond Arabic 1. homework is a lot because you have to learn the alphabet and practice writing. Went into this class with zero Arabic, after 1-2 terms I could actually read basic things and speak. Like any language, what you put in is what you get out. Solid guaranteed grade, workload is pretty constant though.\"",

She is an amazing language teacher and cares more about her students than anyone I've met. In Arabic 1 you learn the alphabet, very very basic grammar, and some basic vocab. However, drill meets 4 times a week which is truly exhausting, and Jamila takes it very personally if you cant give the class your all, so if you choose to take Arabic with her, make sure that you are ready to give the class an honest effory.\""
