We have 2 mat sessions and 2 class sessions a week (so yes x-hour is always used), but they are honestly so fun. The mat sessions consist of a warmup, then learning different aikido techniques and trying them with different partners. It's super chill and you don't have to be good at any of it or experienced, as long as you try and learn. For the classroom sessions we usually just talked about the readings, which were sometimes a little long but pretty interesting and not too hard to understand. We had a lot of guest speakers/guest sensei's which also made the class really enjoyable. Would absolutely recommend you take this!\"",

This was the first time ever that this class was offered, so there were definitely some rough patches and inconsistencies between the syllabus and what we actually did. Overall, the mat sessions were really fun and interesting and the lectures were a bit dry, but also thought-provoking. Dorsey geared the aikido techniques toward all different skill levels so everyone felt comfortable. The mat sessions were very low-pressure and low-stakes, and even the Enbukai (final demonstration) which was technically our final was chill and fun. This class is 100% a layup. No need to do any of the readings, but honestly most of them were really interesting! Guest lecturers/demonstrators were awesome and probably my favorite part of the class. Dorsey was really into getting our feedback about the class so he can tweak things and make the class better for the next time he offers it. 10/10 would recommend!\"",

I learned so much about Korean literature and history, specifically about Korea's relationship with other Asian powers such as China and Japan through colonialism and other sources of influence. She made classes interesting through a mix of her lecturing, student presentations, and class discussions and she frequently challenges us to engage with the material in deeper, more thoughtful ways. She also speaks Korean, Chinese, and Japanese (and makes all sorts of cool connections) and frequently invited guest lecturers to come and speak to us. As an Asian-American, I was personally really interested in learning more about Korean literature and history and this course touches really interesting aspects of the Korean War and the modern K-wave. The readings and discussion posts for class are very manageable (maybe 2 hours per assignment) and we also got to watch K-dramas and analyze Parasite! This was my favorite course I took this term!\""

The readings can be pretty dense, but they are mostly interesting and Prof Eom goes over the main points from the readings in class anyway. I also liked that there is a student-led discussion segment almost every class and felt like I had some pretty good discussions when people were actually engaged with the material. Grading is chill, just short discussion posts for every class, a take home midterm, and a research paper/ final project at the end. The research paper took a while for me to get through (10-12 pages), but you can kind of pick whatever topic you want and don't even have to do a traditional paper if you have a creative project or something else in mind.

Material - starts off pretty basic (i.e. basic tenets of Buddhism) and works up to actually looking at the role of Buddhism in relation to the Korean/Japanese states throughout history. We had readings due pretty much every class period, roughly 20-50 pages per class but pretty manageable. Prof. Simpson also posted a weekly 20-30 minute lecture that was pretty easy to follow and quite informative. There were a couple readings I found super dry, but for the most part I found myself actually enjoying most of the readings. Assignments - five \"thinkpieces\" due throughout the term - 500 words, and she made most of them optional towards the end of the term. We also had three major \"papers\" of 1000 words each - one comparative, one deep dive into Korea or Japan, and one on a modern depiction of Buddhism in anime or film. Pretty easy, but Simpson insisted on each being \"visually interesting\" as well - for most people, that just meant putting a couple images throughout their papers. Every Friday we would also do group work with (assigned groups) - generally took no more than 30 minutes to an hour an a half. We also had one live class discussion each week, but as usual we ended up having the same 5-7 people talking for the whole time - participation wasn't as stressful because of the whole pass/fail. Professor - I thought Simpson was super great and very understanding! She's clearly super passionate and knowledgeable about Buddhism and it made the class more interesting.

You can put as much or as little effort into these and do well in his class either way.

All the prompts for the midterm, research paper, and final are the most boring and low-effort questions a teacher could possibly ask. I (and everyone else in the class I knew) almost died of boredom while writing all of them. The slides he uses are recycled from random other events he has spoken at and they are 99% percent images, meaning if you miss something while taking notes there is no going back to learn anything for the midterm and final. The slides are not helpful at all and his lectures are all completely monotone and he just skips between buildings and paintings too quickly and without any depth, meaning you don't learn anything complex enough to be meaningful. He is super inaccessible with no set office hours and never answers emails. Usually took three attempts to get him to answer a basic question. The readings for discussion posts are all super bland and long (though you quickly realize he never reads any of them since he is not invested in teaching at all so you can bullshit). Bad class.

It can be characterized a layup, but one that will you give you a useful primer on Japanese religion and the basics of religious art and architecture. A myriad of prevailing themes added nuance to the class, such as the continuity of religious architecture over time and the evolution of sacred art and architecture to meet the needs of a modern society. Not only were lectures highly visually engaging but Hockley was clearly passionate, knowledgeable, and friendly, often offering interesting tangents about his own experiences and compelling examples connected to the course.

Somewhat of a heavy reading load and you have to write a 500+ word discussion post on each day's reading before class, but I found all of the readings pretty interesting and relevant to the lectures. Class had a midterm (basically just two short essays on topics graded by Hockley and Eom individually), a final project proposal (figure out your topic way in advance!), a 4-minute presentation on that same topic, and an 8-12 page final research paper on that topic due at the end of finals period. You also have to lead a discussion group twice in the class, but this is pretty easy - basically just prepare some questions on the reading to talk about in class. Hockley and Eom are fair graders in my opinion but the cutoff for an A is pretty high (96%). Not too hard to do well if you're engaged in class and willing to put in the work on your research project. I found the lectures very interesting, especially the guest speakers that talked to the class either by Zoom or in-person. Overall a good introduction to the ASCL department.\"",

The only reason I managed to scrape by was because of participation points. However, I love Dr. Hockley and he was super helpful and friendly (not a nice grader though). I had great discussions with Hockley during office hours when I was trying to get my grade up, but when I went to Eom's OH she pretty much told me I was screwed... Hockley is the OG tho. Overall a good class, 8/10.\"",

You view various perspectives about debates regarding Hong Kong's autonomy, Kashmir\u2019s independence, China\u2019s growing power in Asia, Russia\u2019s fall from global prominence, Russia-China relations, Japan\u2019s current role in Asia, China-Japan relations, Taiwan, and much more.

To you, dear reader, who may choose to take this class, I request one favor \u2014 while you are enjoying the class, please pay attention to how many times Professor Rezvani uses the phrase \u201cfood for thought\u201d, or how much he emphasizes the value of \u201ccounter arguments.\u201d You will be amazed. Lastly, you will be tasked to write a few essays within this class, and in my experience, the best way to excel within these essays is to really emphasize the counter-arguments against your claim, and refute them.

She is fun, gives good feedback, and has really great content to teach. It was much more linguistics based than I anticipated, and I was surprised at how much of the content was new for me, especially given that I'm a senior. The readings are a bit time consuming, and you actually have to do them because she cold-calls in class and requires summaries/responses for each paper. However, she is a nice grader and you will be well-rewarded for your work. It's not an Arabian Nights style layup, but it was very manageable and I think most people did very well. There are 2 essays instead of exams, and they are very fair. They incorporate the papers read in class, lectures, and other outside research. Again, very doable. I would definitely recommend this class to anybody who is looking to learn a lot in a stress-free environment :)\"",

The class really made me challenge the ways I think about English and Chinese/Japanese/Korean languages, which is something I think was really nice and important to get out of it. I sometimes felt like I was in over my head with the readings, but she didn't expect us to read the super dense stuff super deeply. The readings are about 20-40 pages per class, which sounds scary (at least to STEM major me) but it goes really fast and you can skim and be totally fine. There's a short canvas post summarizing and responding to the readings before each class. The whole reading and canvas post thing takes about 1-2 hours to do, plus a midterm and final paper (4 and 6 pages each?). I'd say its on the edge of being a layup: you have to put some work into it, but it wasn't that hard while still being engaging and interesting. Would recommend and would take another class with Hori Sensei.\"",

I believe if I was an upperclassmen I would 100% call this class a layup but since this was my first term and I was still getting my bearings I wouldn't call it a complete layup. We had 2 readings totaling around 40 pages with summaries and responses due three times a week for each class. It took me about me about 2 and half hours to complete the entire assignment. I learned a lot about East Asian culture that I probably would've never learned otherwise. Professor Schmidt-Hori is so funny and I will try and take another course with her.\"",

The class format is as it says in the other reviews, but one thing to mention is that the class is a complete layup because Hori-Sensei is quite frankly the most generous grader there is (our average midterm essay grade was a 98%).

She appeared to be bored discussing the assigned readings and forced students to work on their own in groups. Nah folks had no idea where to start because secondary texts are dense and boring. Hori sensei has no guidelines, office hours or respect for students. We had an x-hour which she didn't attend due to a meeting. She made us watch a video from youtube.

Sensei Hori is certainly a character, but I actually learned a lot from her and gained knowledge on a subject I had no prior ideas about. There are nightly readings but not too long (for the most part), and 300-word responses every time. We also have 4 quizzes that are pretty easy as long as you study the specific topics she tells you to. Classes are a mix of lecture and small-group discussion every day. She definitely expects some knowledge of Japanese language and culture going in, no matter what the syllabus says, but without that I just leaned into not knowing and it was fine. Super rogue class but also very easy to do well in.\"",

            "review 3: \"22S with Sachi Schmidt-hori: Other reviews have stressed how awful Hori is and how much work she gives in this class. It's true that the work seems like a lot--she assigns 250-300 word \"summaries\" every class on each of the 50-80 page readings, and there are multiple readings for some days. At the beginning, it can feel quite overwhelming. And she actually *does* read every student's summaries and will take points off for inaccurate writing (at least for the first half of the class until the midterm). However, Hori-sensei is a compassionate teacher and she has made it very clear multiple times that you are supposed to grapple with the work and not understand it at first. She will always allow students to redo summaries if they just ask her first. At the beginning of the class, Hori will explain how a student should be analyzing and understanding the texts assigned in class. DO NOT underestimate this explanation. Once you learn to view the assigned readings through the specific critical lens that she discusses early on, class discussions and summaries become a cakewalk. And there are only two real \"assignments\" in this class--the midterm and the final. Arguably the only really challenging one was the final, which is an essay with incredibly specific guidelines. Hori is also an incredibly engaging prof. Most students probably heard what she had to say in class and decided they didn't understand it and that she was bad at teaching. It's true that certain concepts could be difficult to truly understand, but she always responds to emails with in-depth explanations and will talk to students about things after class and during office hours. Not to mention Washburn, the co-teacher, is an excellent resource and understands that Hori isn't always the easiest to get. Class discussions can be fun too if you allow them to be fun--a lot of the texts are really nutty or controversial, which can be interesting to talk about. Not as bad of a course as people make it out to be, but can be stressful at times. Overall I'm happy with what I got out of it and I think I learned a lot.\"",

WORST EXPERIENCE AT DARTMOUTH SO FAR! Hori might be good at gender studies, but she even struggled to get her ideas across. She is also VERY VERY harsh and even mean when it comes to grading. If you read a little bit of the assigned readings, you would learn nothing new in her lectures. The class discussion was just a waste of time as people try to bs their thoughts out of the readings. Professor Washburn, who co-teaches this class, was great but still could not save this class from Hori's ravage. For each class, you get ~50 pages of reading or 3 hours of film watching, then write a summary/response to it. She gave little guidance in the first half of the term and everyone just ended up writing 3 1000-word essays per week. The midterm and the final essays are not long, but it would be miserable to write if you are not interested in the intersection of literature and gender studies. (The midterm, where you and another student create a letter exchange between a man and one of his lovers, was just ridiculous and useless.) Did I learn something from this class? Yes, a little. But it was definitely not worth the time and effort I put into this class. To those who want to take the Japanese LSA, try to take another Japan-related class and ask for a waiver of this class if Hori continues to teach it.\"",

Sometimes I would only spend about 5 minutes on them and be done. Got graded on three different 2-3 page papers and they were 15 pts each. The prompts were straightforward and you could just skim through the old readings to find evidence and stuff.
