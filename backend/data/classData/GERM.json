The down side to this was that we didn't end up getting to all the books that were on the syllabus. Weekly 1-2pg (casual!) response papers, a 5-7(?)pg midterm and a longer (~12pg) final paper with 2 short (1-2pg) responses as a take home. Classes usually made up of a short introductory background lecture on the reading/author/history followed by a class discussion. Really awesome class- take it!!- even if you're not a German major or minor you can do well in and learn a lot from this class.\""

This class is tough, it requires a lot of reading and writing, but it never fails to be enlightening. Shookman is a very kind and sensitive professor, always available in and out of class for questions on the reading and on papers. And he is passionate about Faust. We started off reading excerpts from the first published work on Faust, a chapbook called \"The History of the Damnable Life and Deserved Death of Dr. John Faustus\" (yup, guess the bias), otherwise known as the English Faustbook. We then read Christopher Marlowe's play, which was based on the Faustbook, and read a fabulous translation of Goethe's Faust, Parts I and II. The class took a two-week break for presentations (we researched a film, piece of music, piece of art or artist, or other work of literature that put a spin on the Faust theme). We then sped through Bulgakov's Master and Margarita and Thomas Mann's 500-page concrete block of a book, Doctor Faustus. We even read parts of the Bible relevant to certain works and examined different translations of works. Prof. Shookman assigned three 5 to 6-page papers and a 10 to 12-page term paper based on the oral report. The work can build up, for he had us write a revision of the previous paper due at the time of the next paper (and he seemed to only grade the revision). At times I had trouble keeping up with the reading, but this was my own fault. (Prof. Shookman repeatedly warned us to start the two last books ahead of time because he forsaw a time crunch--I found I never had time.) To trace the Faust theme throughout literature, art, film, music, and even advertisements is fascinating, indeed. Prof. Shookman was a helpful guide--and often he felt like just that, a guide, for some of the books are so rich and complex that there was just not enough time to discuss everything. Prof. Shookman makes you work--in that gentle, mild-mannered way of his--and when the class is over you feel like you can take anything; you feel tough. And a little light-headed. Thus heavenly. Okay, take the class no matter what you feel. Take it to go to hell. (Sorry, I've been waiting for a chance to say that, and I never had the guts to say it aloud.)\""

Readings were fairly challenging, and it was a lot. It is expected since you get to read Freud's writings, along with secondary readings from other psychologists and philosophers, such as Carl Jung, Karen Horney, Zizek, or Judith Butler. Also, you had to read some books at its entirety - since I also had readings for my Freshman Seminar, I could not complete readings, which is unfortunate. Discussions were very interesting. The class had two graduate students pursuing a graduate degree on Liberal Studies. They provided deep insights on the readings, which enriched the discussion. Furthermore, Prof. Fuechtner did a marvelous job in bringing, and encouraging, diverse viewpoints. She was great in leading discussions. Students asked thoughtful, intelligent questions. She also had students contribute on Blackboard discussions (20% of your grade). This trend continued there. Another unique feature was \"Freud blog,\" where students upload any interesting articles/video clips related to Freud (minimum of 2 entries). She probably wanted students to engage themselves with Freud outside the classroom - I believe it served its function. Furthermore, in consideration of students who have difficulty speaking out in front of people, she counted Freud Blog contributions (if 3+) to participation grade. The major assignment is, of course, a final research paper. Here, you can choose whatever topic you want to explore. If you have difficulty, you can certainly go to the office hour. She gives insightful guidance whenever you are stuck. While writing a 15-page paper was challenging, I enjoyed exploring my chosen topic, partially due to the prof's helpful advice on my paper. The professor was passionate on the subject, and she showed it. As a hard-core math/science person, I think it will be one of the few courses I really enjoyed throughout my Dartmouth career - despite being a Humanities course, that is.\"",

            "review 5: \"06W with Veronika Fuechtner: I have mixed feelings about this course. On the one hand, the course was very ambitious and sought to tackle Freud from many different angles (as is evident from the many cross-listings). We also read a substantial body of Freud's work, which was a great, and I think the WGST, and Jewish Studies angles were covered quiet well, as was the Germanistic side of the course (which is my interest). On the other hand, the material for the course was overwhelming for the class. The course attracted a diverse group of students some freshman, some seniors -- all from different majors and different places. Unforunately, the reading level and theoretical difficulty of the texts made it suitable to an upper-level seminar. Thus, discussion was often halting, slow and superficial -- frustrating both for the younger students trying to understand and the older students wishing to take the discussion to a higher level. Prof. Fuechtner should have stepped in and provided more lecture, especially in the beginning, to make sure we were all at the same level. Another problem with this course that is probably mentioned in other reviews was the lack of feedback. We didn't receive any grades until our final grade, which I consider to be a poor effort on Prof. Fuechtner's part. I have had her many times before and find her to be a brilliant scholar and mentor, so I was somewhat disappointed by this class in that regard, but feel I should add that this experience was out of sync with my other experiences of her as a professor, in all of which she was very well organized. My only critique of the course material is the actual focus on \"pscyhoanalysis.\" We focused so much on studying Freud from a cultural studies angle that our grounding in the theory of pyschoanalysis was somewhat weak. We read all of his published case studies, but only one of the introductory lectures, leaving us to derive his theories from his cases.\""

Still, they took attendance daily (again high school), which was certainly the main attraction. Professor: The professor did not do a whole lot, since every lecturer was a guest, except make absolutely awful tests. A large portion of the grade was based on bi-weekly reading quizzes with fill in the blanks. These tests were trivial, eerily reminiscent of high school, and difficult. I read every shred of the material in this class, and the reading quizzes were still impossible. Simultaneously, they were prone to cheating, which made it difficult to keep up with what I would estimate to be more than a quarter of the class.

Every lecture required a good two hours of reading or a film. At the end of the course these got crammed together. Mostly, the work was frustrating because the sense of purpose in this class was very low. You could read all you wanted, and you would probably still do poorly on the reading quizzes.

The material is pretty cool -- you get to read Herder, Hegel, Nietzsche. The course starts off a bit slow with many essays (that you have to read). Essays are a bit hard to read and pretty boring at times. That just makes the plays and novels we read later on that much more exciting. You don't have to be interested in Greek culture or German literature to appreciate this course; it gets interesting anyway. We only had to write four essays and Professor Shookman gave us plenty of time on all of them. That's pretty much it for the course. Now for Professor Shookman, he is indeed the nicest, most cultured gentleman perhaps anywhere. Though he is soft-spoken, everything he says has a profound impact. He really clarifies difficult course material and facilitates discussion. In terms of writing, Professor Shookman is the best teacher you could possibly have. I disagree with the person who made Shookman out to be a mean editing fiend. On the contrary, all of Professor Shookman's edits are helpful and never critical.

It's the intro class for German literature, for kids who go into it having had only 2 terms of German at Dartmouth, taught on the LSA simultaneously w/ German 3 (a run-through of basic German grammar) & German 5 (history/art history). The content of this course, from what I hear, is basically up to the prof, & Shookman did an excellent job making it manageable and not too intimidating, but at the same time providing us with decent, interesting literature. We read out of a book called \"Mitlesen, Mitteilen\" (roughly, read together, share together, i think) which includes a bunch of short stories by fairly contemporary authors. The 1st one, \"Mittagpause,\" is only a page long. you read approximately 1 story per class, not always... the reading's very reasonable, although if you really want to understand everything, it can take a while to look up all the words, 'cause you're vocabulary's (obviously) not very good at the beginning of the term especially. The essays are very doable too. Because it's our 1st class of literature in German (reading, discussions, writing, answers to questions - everything's in German) the essays we're supposed to write are really short - 1 to 2 pp. tops. You turn in rough drafts of everything, which the prof corrects for you, then make corrections & turn in final copies for a grade. Shookman's a very fair grader - he's demanding & doesn't like mistakes on papers (understandably, when he's corrected them once) and demands good work for a good grade. You need to have something to say & support it with textual citations- bs won't fly. But the grades are fair & not horribly hard. In discussions, Shookman is absolutely amazing - highly recommended in German or English - his English German in translation classes are without question among the best classes in the school. Especially in those, he says very little, but asks incredibly thought-provoking questions that somehow make the students themselves come to insights about the works, on their own, as it were. He has to talk more in this class than sometimes, considering he's the only one who really knows German, but it's still a thought-provoking discussion class impressively so for how little of the language you go in knowing. There are also lots of little group excercises that we did in class - fun, mostly, & helped a lot with language practice.\""

Don't let this class stop you from going on the LSA, because it's incredible otherwise. But dear god this class was almost insufferable. In class, we only covered one topic in detail, the Brandenburger Tor. I did learn a lot from the presentations of classmates, but these were presented under the specter of very unclear presentation requirements. For example, my presentation date was the first in the class. On the syllabus this project was marked as \u201cThesenpapier/Referat/Filmprojekt.\u201d Noting that, my partner and I each wrote Thesenpapiers for our respective topics, I put five hours into preparing a short film about our topic, and they worked towards creating a brief slideshow for our presentation. On the presentation date, Christine was surprised that I\u2019d made a film for the \u201cFilmprojekt\u201d and did not want me to play it for the class out of fear that any grammatical mistakes in the text fields of the film would be seen by classmates and subconsciously replicated. We did play the film but only after she explained that the \u201cFilmprojekt\u201d part of this large project did not actually require creating a film; rather, one from YouTube would suffice. In later presentations other classmates created films but they had to be without text. I found this to be frustrating, especially considering that after her grades were filed, I still have no clue how my partner and I performed on this project worth 40% of our term grade. Only 30% worth of our grades were ever returned, and my final grade in the class was equal to the worst graded assignment that I'd received back.

            "review 1: \"09F with Irene Kacandes: The material is your standard Intro German, and, as a foreign language, is actually very manageable. I wasn't a very big fan of the textbook. I thought it was weak on grammar explanation, but it had a lot of example problems for you to work out. There are tests every week or two with an oral component, a midterm, and a final. The tests aren't too difficult, but they are graded very strictly. Missing capitalization on any nouns, misplaced umlauts, etc.. will all result in points taken off. One problem I had with the class was that grades were somewhat arbitrary. You get a score of +x or -x (there is extra credit) on your tests, but they don't correlate to any specific grade. I got the feeling that Prof. Kacandes simply picked everyone's grades at the end of the term. I would describe Professor Kacandes as a double edged sword. She knows a lot about German, cares about the subject, and is a committed teacher. At the same time, she is simply too intense for German I. She expects every student to act like a German major, and she will jump on students for not understanding the material. A common theme in any review of her is a conflicted view of how sensitive she is towards her students. In one sense, she is sensitive because she will go out of her way to make sure that students of different ethnical, religious, sexual, and educational background feel equally welcome. But, she will not hesitate to tear students down, she demands complete respect, and maintains a very high view of herself. All in all, I give a mixed recommendation of her as a German I teacher. She would be fantastic to take an upper-level German class with, but she was too intense for German I and it really turned me off to the language. At the same time, I did learn a lot and I probably could have put more effort in from my side.\"",

I found that the class was paced in a way that made it challenging enough to be interesting without being impossible. Prof Kacandes was wonderful and really knew how to explain things clearly. I found her comments and corrections in class and on the homeworks very helpful. She did a great job trying to make the learning process fun and she also taught us a lot about the best ways way to efficiently study a language so that you retain what you learn.

He encourages lots of class participation, and his exams (though I heard are harder than a lot of other intro german classes) are fair, and always have a listening, reading and speaking portion to encompass the whole language experience.
