            "review 1: \"22S with Marcelo Gleiser: I was initially pretty hyped about this course, but as the year went on, my enthusiasm dramatically decreased. Gleiser is indeed a genius, arguably the Dartmouth prof who is the most well-known in the public eye. But---as is usually the case with these kind of profs---he doesn't really seem to care that much about the class. Probably the biggest issue is the focus of the class (or rather, the lack of such.) The class can't decide if it's about space, about aliens in media, or if it's a general \"philosophy of science\" class. As such, it does none of the three particularly well. The class discussions, which seemed promising at first, were mostly just Gleiser talking about whatever he felt like. Gleiser also let students derail the topic question of the day with no repercussions, so we mostly just circled around the same vague, surface level discussions. Usually, this entailed the same few students saying random shit about public policy, without any actual evidence to back up their claims. As for the actual classwork, it consists of a 15 page Course Journal (cut down to 12 pages) (35%), 5-8 page final paper (35%), presentation of a question for class discussion (20%), and class participation (10%). Gleiser is not really as easy of a grader as you would hope. He grades really harsh on class participation, which is probably why there were so many people sucking up to him in the class. And, although he claims that you can write about whatever you want, if it doesn't correspond to his opinion on the topic, your grade is going to suffer. He also doesn't grade anything until after the term ends, which is annoying. And, everything is due before reading period starts, so you have less time than you would hope to wrap things up. Overall, this seminar is not as interesting as it seems and is not even that easy grade wise. Even if you're a space nerd, I'd find a different seminar.\""

I don't know who the last couple of reviews were written by but this class was so stressful for no good reason, literally just take Math22 instead this class is the same as that but more content, plus you need like 93% to get an A. Seriously, the pharmaceutical industry needs to place this man in a cryogenic chamber and analyze his brain and vocal cords because holy shit even I, an insomniac, was put to sleep every single time I went to class. Seriously, I don't know why I took this class and you shouldn't either, I don't see it as super useful compared to Math22 even if you are a Physics major, and the problem sets are insanely hard unless you work with others and regardless the professor is silently waiting to snipe anyone who he thinks are working together. This almost severed several of my friendships if you ever wondered what it would be like fighting in Normandy during World War II, then this class would be a very good way to experience something similar although at least fighting in a war would keep you awake. Seriously it's not like this class is objectively bad but it's just that I never saw any point or fulfillment to taking this class for my Science distribution as it was so hard and I never felt on top of it. And I took Math22 the same term and as someone terrible at Math I found that a lot better. Apologies for being harsh but seriously this course is just stressful. The best part is whenever I would find a problem set difficult, I would check the median on Canvas and it would be 100/100 since everyone in the class either got a lot of help or knew everything taught beforehand, this class is like waking up and being told to perform a lifesaving brain surgery and all you have learned in medical school is that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. I'm sure some of you aspiring physicists think that I'm just bad at math (which by the way is 95% of the class there is barely any physics) and I need to get good, just don't say I didn't warn you. Sometimes I would drink beer to calm down while working on these problem sets that are due at 9pm at not midnight, which was set to \"save us stress\" from staying up, little did the professor know that the three hours spend after submitting an incomplete problem set were spent by the students of Physics22 having a panic attack on their bed thinking about the entire coding language, Mathematica, that we were forced to learn for a single class where the lectures were useless because all of us in the class were hungover from drinking away our anxiety the night before because of the cursed weekly problem set.\"",

The first two thirds of the class is linear algebra and isn't too bad with one hour open note midterms that had reasonable questions on them. The final third is differential equations, which is just hard, and the final was quite challenging, so be ready for that. Get a study group for this class and go to office hours and you will be all set! And try not to fall asleep in class - Mueller is so calming and soothing you almost want to fall asleep sometimes!

The final project of this class was really cool: Elizabeth had us conduct a literature search, write an introduction, and perform calculations for one of her papers that she's writing, so there's a good chance we might end up being coauthors as undergrads (which, trust me, is huge for us at this level and very generous of her). The class was a little haphazardly organized because it was the first time we ran it, but it was still one of my favorite classes I've taken at Dartmouth and would highly recommend to anyone who's interested in astronomy, no prerecs required!

I slightly disagree with the previous reviewer's statement that this class makes P41 look like it has a light workload-- in my experience, the two classes are just really different. When I took P41 (23W, Millan) there were 8 medium-length psets, 2 midterms, and a final, and we \"only\" covered ch. 1-9 of Griffiths. When I took P77, there were supposed to be 6 psets but Caldwell ended up only assigning 5 (I think it had something to do with the fact that HW4 was kind of double length and he had to go to a conference during week 8 and left us with a former grad student guest lecturer who used very different math notation than we'd been using all term). There were also two quizzes (each took up half a 2A class block), a midterm (in class), and a final (during the regularly scheduled block). We also covered the majority of the material in Hartle, an amazingly clear (but admittedly almost 600 page) textbook: ch.1-13 and 20-23. Despite devoting most of my time to this class and trying to get ahead, the difficulty of the problems and the fact that Caldwell would usually only tell us the next class's material (up to about three chapters at a time) about 48 hours in advance, so things would just creep up no matter how proactive I was. If I had to choose between taking or forgoing P77, I would choose to take it, a million times over. The material was fascinating, and I feel like I learned it much more deeply than I would have if the prof had been more chill. Caldwell is also an icon, and always finds a way to make silly GR jokes during lecture. I ended up taking P77 alongside P43 and an upper-level language class with a nontrivial workload and while I was really busy, it was ultimately all okay.\"",

(he may gaslight you into taking it if he needs more ppl in the class... lol) It is not remotely easy, however it is EXTREMELY fascinating. I took it in the winter w Prof. Onofrio. He is wildly knowledgeable and a really sweet (old) guy. However he suffers as a lecturer from being so smart and knowledgable he cannot communicate concepts at an introductory level. For context, I am a final year BE engineering undergrad. There were 5 ppl total in the class, everyone else a physics major. If you have not had extensive exposure to Special & General Relativity as well as Quantum Mechanics, you will likely not know 75% of the math done in this class. I mean I literally had not ever seen the vast majority of mathematical symbols presented. Your ability to thoroughly understand the concepts will be limited if you don't have prior exposure to (or a surplus of time to self-teach): -field theory -quantum field theory -group theory *as applied to quantum mechanics* -gauge theory, gauge invariance -Lagragian + Hamiltonian (extend concepts to infinite dimensions over spacetime) -Hilbertian Algebra (and Clifford Algebra) *as applied to quantum mechanics* -Tensors -Generators -Unitary Groups and Spaces (And the relevant algebraic concepts ie: commuting, complex conjugate of a tensor, dagger symbol...) and more! -Renormalization The class is in 3 parts and basically surveys developments in particle physics over the past 100 years in detail. First is a more qualitative look, culminating in quark theory. From there, its all theoretical mathematical descriptions of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. (Math heavy, the kind with not a single number) Midterms: He gives 2 - 3 midterms (our last one was week 9 RIP). Each is 33 multiple choice (options a - c which is nice), with medians between 70 - 80%. These are conceptual/logical, and each of the answer choices vary only by a word or two. You have to actually understand the concept and theory to get it right. Also review the homework. There are 1 - 3 questions you basically won't be able to answer if you don't remember the answer to a calculation from the HW. Homeworks: He gives one homework every 2 weeks, ranging from 8 - 12 questions. These are either proof or problem based. They take a while, but he is helpful if you ask him questions and he is always willing/around to answer. Homeworks weren't horrid, but take time. Expect to read/search the book to actually know how to answer them. Final: The final is either a culminating multiple choice exam (as discussed above) or a final presentation. For the presentation, meet with him to discuss exactly what he expects. He will not give you any info as to what he wants to see and there is no actual paper explaining the assignment. I made this mistake... But its basically a 20 min presentation and 10 minute defense (he is Italian and this is classic old school Italy academia). Lectures: There were only 2 x-hours the whole term, but the lecture is very dense. He will just do derivations on the board for 2 hours straight and he doesn't even need to look at notes to do this. Its crazy impressive, but 50% minimum always went over everyone's head. It would def help to read the text book before every class and wikipedia is fantastic on the material. But, this takes a ton of time, especially given the textbook is written by a nobel prize winning scientist and is also not very introductory. Yet to be seen if he curves, but he is so sweet, so I do expect some help. Overall a great class, but you really need the time and motivation to understand/learn the concepts. If you are interested in the topic, you have access to one of the best people in the field. But, that also means he basically can't explain it to you in a way you will understand if you only have taken up to Calc 3, Diff Q, Physics 13 + 14...\"",

With that out of the way, I can start complaining. The workload of this class was downright RIDICULOUS. There are weekly problem sets that probably took 10 hours MINIMUM, so be prepared. Initially we were supposed to have FOUR MIDTERMS, but thankfully Prof Lynch ended up cutting that down to three; still, there were a lot of tests. There's also nightly textbook readings, but these weren't so bad because the textbook is truly fantastic. Classtime was next to useless; maybe that's because it was over Zoom, but I was physically unable to pay attention. If you're not majoring in physics, think VERY carefully before you take this class. If you are a physics major, you have to take this class at some point, so just make sure your term is pretty chill otherwise.

            "review 8: \"19W with Kristina Lynch: Some people will enjoy this class and others won't: make sure your vector calculus chops are up to par (differentiation, integration, Stokes' Theorem, Gauss's Theorem, using delta functions, etc -- Griffith's Electrodynamics covers these in the first chapter in a physics-y manner). Don't jump into this course blindly. That said, I really enjoyed the class: it is a general intermediate-level course on electromagnetic phenomena, starting with relatively familiar material like Coulomb's Law, Gauss's Law, etc (though these are presented using the full language of vector calculus now) and ending with stuff like conservation laws and electromagnetic waves. You learn to solve boundary-value problems, deal with partial differential equations (separation of variables, Fourier series -- I still would really recommend taking a course dedicated to partial differential equations, like 46 or (new) 53); you learn techniques like the method of image charges, multi-pole expansions; you learn about the vector potential, which isn't talked about in introductory courses. You generally learn a lot of stuff, but the main reason I liked the course is that all of these things are intimately connected, and everything that is introduced feels well-justified. Classical electromagnetism really is a very pretty theory -- in hindsight, is I wish we talked a lot more about than waves than we got to, but with these dreaded 9 week terms what can you do. Tips: do a lot of problems; when you're reading do so with a paper and pencil in hand and write down everything you deem important, curious, necessary, or confusing, and set up problems along with the author's exposition; when something is introduced, ask if it feels justified, and if it isn't make a note; be diligent, in general -- this is not a trivial course. I am not going to talk about the logistics too much as they seem to depend on who is teaching the course, but Prof. Lynch is very good (she's a plasma physicist) -- if you can take 41 with her, do so. If after the course you feel hungry for more stuff, try to finish up the Griffiths book (you only cover like the first 9 chapters where there's like 12 in the book) and then you can try to study some differential geometry, more gauge theory, look up some more mathematically rigorous/advanced treatments of E&M -- all very interesting stuff!\""

As a result, this class was an absolute grind that ate up over half of my time, even with two other science classes in the same quarter. This class had the hardest weekly p-sets I'd yet experienced, and each could stretch to over 8 hours of work. However, I learned a ton and feel extremely confident moving into the rest of the physics major. Millan graded the two midterms and final very reasonably, with points being mostly based on technique and work. Also, we were expected to do readings from the textbook before each class, which were checked with canvas reading quizzes. These were just to check if people were getting the material, and everyone got an auto 100%. Even if you accidentally missed a few, she'd still give you full credit. Just goes to show that Millan really cares about students understanding the material, not petty bs. She was also readily accessible with office hours multiple times a week with times based on student availability. Anyways, good luck!

That's essentially it. The structure is what you would expect from a 40s sequence Physics class and it worked quite well.

Nevertheless, the subject matter itself was very interesting and structured very neatly. There were brief interludes on relativity and wave mechanics (although some students coming in might have covered these already in a previous course.) Also, we barely scratched the surface of quantum mechanics and ended the course with the Schrodinger Equation in 1 dimension (not applied to the H atom, etc). This is understandable as a course in differential equations is probably needed to really understand this particular subject in more depth. Prof. Lawerence is a very good prof, very friendly and interesting.

This meant the lectures were increasingly lagging behind our homeworks and labs, adding additional unnecessary stress to an already unfortunate situation. On the other hand, our TA, James Logan, was outstanding. He pulled the majority of the weight of the course, running our labs, grading our labs and homeworks, and offering sessions each week to help us understand the content.

Also, the grading is very fair... 48% problem sets (easy to get perfect or close to perfect working with a group), 24% labs (fun, and easy to get perfect with Paul Nation as TA), 12% midterm (was difficult, but Hans was generous with partial credit), 16% final (one death problem, but Hans was super-amazingly generous with partial credit). Single-page-front-and-back crib sheets are allowed on exams... trig identities, integration by parts, and Taylor series identities proved quite helpful.

The course starts out with waves (some trig), (mechanical and electromagnetic), then covers some special relativity, two slits experiment and photoelectric effects, some classical atomic physics (bohr model) and finally a very short introduction to quantum mechanics. There were 4 short labs. Although the textbooks were \"required\", I DID NOT BUY THEM AT ALL. I relied solely on the notes I took in class and I easily got an A. That's how effective the lectures were. The problem sets and exams were very straightforward, and for exams we are allowed to bring one piece of paper with notes on them, so that we are not bogged down with memorization (I don't know if this is still in place). Professor Mueller is a great lecturer, and is fairly funny (although when I took it, it was his first time teaching it). His German accent actually helped me pay attention in class despite it being a 9L. If you know calculus and trig, and you're looking for a good science class, I strongly recommend this one.\""

I had read reviews saying that Prof. Soh was awful, but I never imagined that she would actually ruin the course for me. Soh is the most inefficient teacher I have ever encountered. We barely covered half of the material that we were supposed to cover in favor of Soh's \"discovering things on your own\" teaching style. She was convinced that if we understood the concepts we could solve any problem. The text book did explain concepts well; however it didn't provide example problems...and neither did Soh. Understanding what goes on means nothing in physics if you cannot solve the problems. Having never seen an example problem going into problem sets, it took countless hours trying to figure out how to actually apply the random equations that Soh jotted on the board. Her lectures were disorganized and did not drive home important points. She also held us to an impossibly high standard when it came to mathematical ability. For instance, a problem on the midterm required us to compute a Taylor series in 3D using vectors, something Soh had briefly shown us in class as a \"you don't really need to remember this\" kind of topic. A similar problem was on the final when we were asked to calculate the conductivity of a metal based on electron scattering rates, another topic only briefly mentioned in class. Unless you've taken E&M with calculus before, do not take this class. Even if you have, do not take it with Soh.\"",

I feel rude walking out of the room when she's still lecturing, but hey -- I had a class to get to in five minutes. It's rude to keep us there that long -Came LATE to our midterm and our final, forcing us to stay longer than we planned. Half an hour before the final ended, she decided to tell us some equations. Half an hour. -Wastes precious time during lecture attempting to fix her mistakes (one time she even blitzed the class to let us know that an example she did in class was wrong and that we'd have to talk about it during a supplemental lecture time) -Left class for a week because she had somewhere more important to be -chooses to show the class long derivations of formulas without first making sure we understand the fundamental underlying concepts. -teaches a different cirriculum than other P16 teachers (maybe she's a big fan of the lorentz transformation, I dunno...) -never does demonstrations in class, even though E&M begs to have demonstrations of Van de Graaff generators and the like. 90% of the classes are lectures. Sometimes she makes us solve problems from the book during class. These are problems that take us hours each to solve for our homework. They're similar to the P15 K&K problems. They can't be solved in ten minutes. Period. As a result of all this, I feel that the class was a waste of time and money. This isn't to say that prof Soh isn't a nice person -- she wants us to learn and she tries to do so. I also have no doubt that she is a brilliantly smart person, but her lectures fail to educate, engage, inspire, or keep awake. When I read the poor reviews for prof Soh at the beginning of the term, I thought I could stick it out and deal with a crummy professor for a term for the sake of having a thorough education of E&M. Guess what? I learned less, did more work, and suffered through harder tests compared to all my peers who took P14.

This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, except she constantly makes mistakes and seems very ill-prepared. During one of our lectures on relativity, she \"derived\" a formula for length expansion, instead of the length contraction that Einstein proved. Speaking of relativity, we spent quite a bit of time discussing it even though we hadnt covered some of even the most basic magnetism concepts, nor did we ever. We spent maybe one week on all of magnetism during which we had supplementary lectures a night in addition to our normal class hours and x-hours. Still we didnt cover two-thirds or more of the magnetism we were supposed. This could be due to the fact that she to the first week of class off to go to a \"conference\" in Vale. Furthermore, though the text contained very few examples, she insisted on reteaching them in class instead of giving us some new material or even saying something more than what the text did. Thus, lectures were an error-filled waste of time for anyone who read the text. Not that the text covered the material all that well. It discussed only the most fundamental level. All the crazy situations we were supposed to be responsible for were to derived from one basic formula. She had a way of considering everything \"trival.\" When we tried to explain to her that we would like more examples to supplement the ones in the text she took this to mean that we thought everything was too easy and that it needed to be harder, instead of the fact that we didnt really understand the material that well after the minimal explanation given in the text as was the case.

Yeong-Ah misinterpreted a few students' comments early in the term when they said that some of the things covered in lecture seemed trivial to them, or something. She took it to mean that everything in the book was trivial, and that it was her role to provide enrichment material in addition to the fiendishly hard problems in the book.

Professor Mueller wants you to learn a lot from his class and try your hardest and if you're doing that your grade will reflect it. Our class finished with an A median despite the fact that we all felt like we were floundering the whole time. Prof Mueller grades incredibly leniently and is absolutely there to help you as much as he can. The pacing of the class got a bit off early on which resulted in too much content being grouped near the end, but the final was curved accordingly and no ones grades suffered. Absolutely take this class, but go in knowing that you'll exit with a bruised ego and have to work insanely hard just to meet all of the deadlines.\"",

One thing that I wish I had known: if you are planning on majoring in physics, and you think that taking P15 will get you ahead in the sequence because you get to skip P19 before P24, you are somewhat wrong. The physics major requires that people who do P15 and P16 instead of P13, P14, and P19 take an extra upper-level elective.

            "review 21: \"05F with Barrett Rogers: You're wondering, \"hmmm... should I take that Honors Intro Physics class, or should I just take the regular one? What exactly is the difference?\" The main difference is that p15 goes a bit more in depth than p13, especially on simple harmonic motion and circular motion. Plus, p13 doesn't have relativity. In p15 everything is accelerated to leave time at the end for Special Relativity, which will blow your mind. The bad news is, Prof. Rogers' lectures can be boring and too fast-paced. Especially in the beginning, he will zip through problems and derivations and it's easy to get lost. And he occasionally used math that I hadn't learned yet in my Math 15 class. I was pretty much clueless for the first two weeks. It does get better, though, and the \"hard material\" ends up being easier than the \"easy material\" because he slows down for it. More bad news: The homework problems are crazy. Expect to spend lots of time and frustration on them. Our class organized our own study groups to tackle them, which helps a bit; but make sure you understand the stuff, because most of the test questions are very similar to the homework problems. (Incidentally, there was one midterm and a final, with a lot of credit for homework). Some of the homework problems will be unfairly hard, to be sure. The good news is, Rogers is the Office Hours God. He has \"official\" office hours, but you can stop by his office anytime, and much more often than he's there and happy to help. He has spent many a half-hour (or even entire hour) going over problems one-on-one with me, making sure that I understand it. You will leave his office hours feeling quite a bit more confident. Even when I thought I had done the problems right, I would go to his office just to make sure. More good news: The tests aren't too bad. There's partial credit galore, and he tends to stick (mostly) to the basic concepts, not the really complicated stuff that turns up in the problems. Also, the curve is crazy; the median grade for my class was an A-. That means that at least half of the class got A- or better. And no, we weren't all physics geniuses -- the grading is just done that way. So, returning to the original question: Honors or no? If you think Relativity is sweet, and you're willing to spend more time and go a bit deeper, and you're not too proud to ask a prof for help, then go for it. Physics 13 is a whole lot of work too, so it's not a quantum leap from p13 work to p15 work. (For the first 2 or 3 weeks, p15 is a lot more work than p13, but p13 picks up the pace significantly after it's done with the easy stuff.) If you'd prefer a slower pace and a bit less work, and you'd prefer to ease into college physics more gently, take p13. Or of course, there's course-shopping. A lot of freshmen aren't familiar with it, but you could just take them both for the first week (or even two weeks) and then pick whichever you like best. Or you could start out in p15 and then transfer to p13 if you feel overwhelmed (which a lot of people will do). Just keep in mind, as said above, that p13 starts off easy but gets harder within a few weeks, while p15 starts off hard and stays there. You'll learn a lot either way, and probably more if you take p15. I don't regret it, and looking back I stressed out about it way more than I needed to.\"",

One week was particularly hard and took upwards of 10 hours though. I usually found that I could puzzle through them on my own without help from the prof. or TA.

Professor Rimberg was genuinely an amazing professor. Here are some fast facts before I get into my experiences with the class: daily readings and lecture videos with a 1-3 question reading quiz (100% participation based - if you attempt all the reading quizzes you will get a 100% on this, regardless of whether or not you get them right), weekly homeworks (think problem sets) that you are encouraged to cooperate with classmates on, labs every other week, 2 midterms and a final. The median for this course was an A, but we all put a lot of effort into it. Professor Rimberg explicitly stated that he aims to have physics 15 have an A- or A median. My experiences: This course is hard but very fulfilling. I spent probably 15+ hours a week on this course. We only had 9 people in the class and one rarely showed up so the rest of us got very close. I kinda bombed the first exam (74/100 I think) and it wasn't curved so that was rough, but professor Rimberg was very understanding and helped me come up with some different study strategies for the next two. I will say that if you are not a physics god coming into this class I heavily recommend forming a weekly or biweekly study group to work on the homework and study with. We met once a week at the start of the course and were meeting like every day during finals week. I heavily recommend going to Rimberg's office hours on Tuesdays as the homeworks are due Wednesday and if you ask intelligent questions about the homework and show that you've at least tried the problems, he will often solve them fully with you during office hours. I heavily recommend this class but it does take a good amount of time.\"",

Problem sets were moderately difficult, but definitely manageable if you give yourself enough time. In comparison to the difficulty of just keeping up with the course, the tests were really easy - Rimberg specifically wrote the tests to not test our understanding of the algebra, which made them very easy to do well on. A couple more things - he really stresses hand-wavy estimation arguments as a way of saving time, which is confusing if you've never done it extensively before as opposed to direct calculations (I definitely was thrown off by the non-specificity of it all) but then he also reminds you that you don't actually need to remember a lot of the stuff for the exams, particularly solutions to the Schrodinger equation. Note that I haven't mentioned the labs - they were a non-issue. (thank goodness with all the other work and optional practice problems haha)\"",

He also had us watch a bunch of the Da Vinci Code in class (relating to antimatter explosions) which was quite fun. The hard part about this course is that it is three classes in one, covering mechanics, special relativity, and quantum mechanics in great detail. The class has so. much. content. The final exam was cumulative, which sucked, just because there were so many possible things that could be on it. However, the vibes of this class were immaculate, generating some of the highest and lowest moments in my first term at Dartmouth. The labs are actually quite fun, and relate to the course content a lot. I would HIGHLY recommend not taking this alongside other important STEM classes, and I would only take this class if you are committed to majoring in physics or ENGS, because this class will demand most of your attention. A few notes: Because of how fast-paced this class is, most of the explanations in class relied on \"canceling, rearranging, and googling\", large and complex equations with hefty amounts of algebra, oftentimes questions about the derivation of a key formula would be dismissed to be studied outside of class. Long story short: trust the process. Getting a good study group was key to passing this class, and honestly made physics a ton of fun.

The other post is right. This class will kick your ass. But if you care more about what you're learning than just your GPA and are up to an intellectual challenge, this class is certainly for you. The labs could be a little boring and dependent on your TA but we all generally had fun. Be ready to do tons of algebra. Find a good study group going forward and you'll survive. I will say again, this class is challenging. Don't be cocky and think because you did well on the AP Physics C exams that you'll waltz in this class and do well. The rest of us all did well on those exams and still found it challenging and rewarding. On a side note, for the last two years, this class was p-set-based and not exam based. Going forward the course is going to be mostly exam-based. If you want accurate data, look for data from more than two years ago or more recently.

Some TAs were more helpful than others so you should figure that out in the beginning. There was this one residential expert that was slept on. what a G. Try to find someone like that. If not, you'll be just fine. Just make sure to give yourself enough time to work it out. I would start early because It'd be a time cushion just in case it ever got too hard. Most of the weeks had like 10-15 questions(sometimes its like 22 questions which was ridiculous. this only happened like 2 times). Written homeworks had 3 questions. shouldnt be too bad if you knew what was going on and to be honest, I had no clue what was going on so that was tricky for me. The labs were 1 hour long. They were just fine honestly. not bad at all. one week we had to share our own results with everyone in the class and they were just so bad. everyone's results were inconclusive haha. so lecture is boring. sometimes overcomplicated. I learned more from reading the book myself and asking the TAs for help or just looking at online videos. Because the exams were take home and open book and because you'd have like from sunday to tuesday to complete the exam, it was easy to just put the readings off until 3 days before the exam which worked out just fine for me. The exam averages were about 80. I scored above that by like 10 points. To be fair, the exams did not involve a lot of math. It was just making sure you understood the concepts. So basically, start early, take notes, but don't overstress for the exam. We have 4 exams but he takes the highest 3. Trickiest part was the homework but you'd have a week to get help so that worked out fine. Exams were not too demanding, so that worked out fine. When I first started, I hated the class. I was like \"omg this prof is going to be the end of me. Why are we starting with special relativity? How am I going to do this alone at home?\" but I managed my time well and after the first midterm I realized I was able to chill a lot more than I thought. I paired this class with another stem course and I really wish I tripled instead considering how generous this prof was with grades and how labs only took 1 hour as opposed to 3. My advice is this: p14 is going to be hard no matter what term you take it. If you have the chance to take it online, take it online. Labs are shorter and professors are considerate.

The online homeworks are super tough, but if you start early and go to a tutor/resident expert sessions, you will get through them.

Prof Caldwell teaches many extra concepts that aren't in the textbook and that other classes don't learn. He also, out of misjudgment or pure sadism, assigns far too much homework. Even with 10 or 12 of us in Novack, it could take 8 hours to complete one written assignment. The homework often covers material not covered in class, and Caldwell does not work out any example problems during lecture. There was a separate TA \"problem solving session\" but it was a complete waste of time as the TA just worked out simple problems from the book and refused to answer specific questions about homework problems. The tests were difficult, but they weren't cumulative. All in all, I've heard that Physics 14 is much easier when taught by other professors in the spring.

Being a distinguished researcher, I am sure that basic EM was somewhat beneath him, so perhaps this is forgivable. However, Caldwell's negligence extended further. Instead of trying to communicate, he would scribble lists of derivations and equations up on the board -- there was no logical development of ideas, no discussion of the mathematics' implications. He just read from his notes and scribbled like a factory robot welding a car together -- impressive in a sense, but you don't really learn much about building cars from it. But wait, you say, he must have worked some problems out. Well, he did occasionally. But the problems he chose were almost always flawed -- they couldn't be solved, or required knowledge we didn't yet have, or required so much mathematical trickery that the concept the problem was supposed to illuminate was instead obscured. Questions weren't answered. I can think of many instances in which a student would make an inquiry, and Caldwell would respond by staring at him/her, seemingly dumbfounded that anyone could fail to comprehend. Then he would turn to the board, and look over his incomprehensible scribblings. With the same look of incredulity, he would turn back to the student. Finally, he would half-turn and raise his hand to the board as if to write out an explanation -- only to say, \"See me after class,\" or something analogous. See him after class? Students would throng to him at first, hoping that in person he could explain things more clearly. No such luck. By halfway through the course, we would shuffle out in stunned silence. And meeting with him outside of class was next to impossible. He was always busy, and his office hours were only two hours late Monday afternoon. I can't say enough negative things about this course. Although I attended class most of the time, I observed a steady drain in attendance. In the last days of class, only about 10-15 people attended out of the original throng. This class was a disaster. Physics used to interest me; now I am resolved never to take the subject again. Many people I know have called the Dean to complain; I, personally, will make a point to send a letter to the Physics department chair after this course is over, arguing against giving Caldwell tenure. But Dartmouth probably won't listen to our complaints. Caldwell is a talented researcher. He worked with Hawking. He's been featured in Scientific American. And Dartmouth wants prestige so that it can go up in the rankings. Dartmouth used to care about its undergraduates' education. But now? Quality teachers? They just aren't as important.\""

A lot of us didn\u2019t start the pset until Sunday/Monday, and I would literally spend my entire day on Monday in Wilder Atrium (where office hours go from like 1:30pm straight to 9pm) grinding a pset until dark dark nighttime. Lab was pretty cool, and only on non-exam weeks, but post-lab homework was also a monday night grind. There was also a really stupid grading thing this term where the default grade you get for doing weekly in-lab was a 90% unless you did \u201cextra credit\u201d but hopefully that didn\u2019t actually make the difference for anyone\u2019s grade because\u2026.

What worked for me was making sure I really comprehensively understood the techniques/formulas I needed to know to solve the psets week to week, so that I had less studying to do before the exams. If you do everything more spaced out, it gets reinforced nicely by labs too, and then before the exam you can focus on reviewing things and your common mistakes rather than teaching yourself materail.

A lot of us didn\u2019t start the pset until Sunday/Monday, and I would literally spend my entire day on Monday in Wilder Atrium (where office hours go from like 1:30pm straight to 9pm) grinding a pset until dark dark nighttime. Lab was pretty cool, and only on non-exam weeks, but post-lab homework was also a monday night grind. There was also a really stupid grading thing this term where the default grade you get for doing weekly in-lab was a 90% unless you did \u201cextra credit\u201d but hopefully that didn\u2019t actually make the difference for anyone\u2019s grade because\u2026.

[Unsolicited Advice] The biggest tip I wish I could give my past self for this class is honestly to start the psets at Friday office hours (I know, hear me out) just to knock out some of the problems and see where I stood with comprehension. What worked for me was making sure I really comprehensively understood the techniques/formulas I needed to know to solve the psets week to week, so that I had less studying to do before the exams. If you do everything more spaced out, it gets reinforced nicely by labs too, and then before the exam you can focus on reviewing things and your common mistakes rather than teaching yourself materail. I took this with CS50 and died a little. It was deadline hopping day to day. I\u2019d recommend making sure you have a good schedule or something if you want to take this with another heavy workload course.\"",

Also he did not let us drop any labs, psets, or exam, which I know all of the previous physics 13 and 14 classes did in the fall and winter.

His first two exams tested the material pretty fairly, although the last exam was INSANELY difficult. The workload in this class is decent, we had online problem sets that could take 1-4 hours and written problem sets also 1-3 hours due every week on top of lab and any additional studying needed to understand the material.

This is brutal because there is no curve and an A is a 95%.

It helps to have some experience with the topics beforehand. I had taken Physics C E&M in high school, which made the course more of a layup for me. There was a lot of content, but at the same time, unless it was right before a midterm, I wasn't doing any work other than the problem sets, and didn't really have to read the textbook at all. Prof. Wright is clearly very passionate about the course and he always makes it very clear that he understands that this is difficult material and we're trying to learn it in a very short amount of time. He even reduced the amount of content that we covered in class so that he could go slower and reduced the frequency of the problem sets to once a week instead of 3 every 2 weeks. Although he was somewhat scattered at times, it seemed more like a product of him reworking the curriculum this term, which I'm sure is an issue that will be resolved in the future. The lab periods weren't too bad - only three of the six took the whole lab period, and the other three were done within an hour and a half. The midterms were very fair, as they weren't super difficult questions and were on basically the same content as the problem sets. One stressful thing was that although there were two midterms, both are split into two parts, worth 30 points each - meaning that if you get 5 points off, which would be maybe one question on the test wrong, then you get a B on that part. There didn't seem to be a curve on the midterms, as the lowest part of each midterm is dropped (so basically you have two chances to on each midterm).

He's super approachable and willing to help you understand the concepts if you don't get it. Now onto the bad. Professor Wright's lectures are not...good. They aren't confusing or super hard to follow, they're just not helpful. He's very scatterbrained, and seems a little stressed while in front of the class, which means he often leaps from topic to topic kinda suddenly or lingers at one spot too long. The material in his lectures is also just not good at helping you understand anything unless you've pretty throughly read the textbook. For all his talk about knowing that this stuff isn't intuitive, he seems to structure his class around you being mostly taught by the textbook, with him reviewing some important topics and maybe clearing up weak points (sometimes). It's a bit annoying, but something you can probably adjust to. Thankfully, Wright's exams are perfectly fair and what one would expect from a physics class with this more difficult material. The questions expect you to think about the material, but are all derived from homework or types of problems we had done in class. He's not out to get you, and clearly uses the homeworks as a guide to show you what he wants you to understand.

        "John Thorstensen": [
            "review 1: \"16S with John Thorstensen: Way better than PHYSICS 13 with LABELLE!!!! After taking Physics 13 with Labelle in the winter, I was close to turning away from engineering and focusing on computer science, but Thorstensen was able to reignite my interest in physical technology. Thorstensen and LaBelle are opposites. LaBelle gives a wonderful lecture but every other aspect of his course (labs, problem sets, tests, studying, etc.) is not very good. Thorstensen\u2019s lecture is only decent, but every other aspect of his class is quite good. It is so frustrating when students say that LaBelle is a better prof than Thorstensen because they of LaBelle\u2019s energy during his lecture. In a intro to engineering Physics class and especially at Dartmouth where terms are shorter so there is less lecture time, lectures only make up a small amount of your workload. You are in lecture for 3:15 hours a week. Consider how labs, reading, homeworks, and sheer studying will probably take at least 6-9 additional hours. For LaBelle, those 6-9 hours were not pleasant, whereas with Thorstensen, those hours really had their moments. People don\u2019t realize that a professor is very much in control of those 6-9 hours. They chose what textbook you use, how difficult of problems to assign, what labs to do, how to set up your assessments, etc. I don\u2019t even know where to start with Thorstensen, he had a system to his teaching. Thorstensen gave a quiz every week. The quizzes were not super difficult, but also not super easy. After each quiz, he gave out a histogram displaying the class\u2019s scores for that week. This kept you competitive and both incentivised/ rewarded you for studying. LaBelle had two big midterms that led to a mad rush of studying. LaBelle\u2019s midterms often used ambiguous questions, sometimes to trip you up. Studying for the quizes was very doable because Thorstenson\u2019s \u201cGiancoli: Physics for Scientists and Engineers\u201d textbook was one of the best textbooks I ever used. It had problems after each 2-3 page section, say on resistors, so you could have fun solving reasonably easy problems. LaBelle used this absolutely awful textbook - \u201cTipler and Mosca: Physics...\u201d Thorstensen assigned all his problems from the Giancoli book, which made studying much more effective. LaBelle assigned problems from a bunch of books, making studying very difficult. Thorstensen also made many of his own labs, which were wonderfully made. Unfortunately, my TA couldn\u2019t really speak English and my fellow students were in such a hurry and so uninterested in the material that the labs did realize their full potential. But I\u2019ve got to say, the labs could get somewhat interesting. You weren\u2019t just rolling carts across lab tables to measure their velocity, you were wiring together different circuits, which is much more interesting. Thorstenson was really a good writer. His labs were well written. Thorstensen also wrote notes that were do before every single lecture and assigned a 3 question reading quiz online before each lecture to test the notes. For the first few weeks, the notes were so good that I actually looked foward to reading them in addition to the Giancoli book. But by week 6, his notes started to lower in quality and it got to a point where reading them became a frustrating exercise and I began to rely more and more on the book. I spent so much time with that book, reading it and doing exercises in it. Thorstensen was not perfect, he still use the same stupid puzzler questions that LaBelle used. For some reason Physics professors are in this fad where they think it is a good idea to present trick questions that illustrate non-intuitive principles of Physics and have students learn by getting them wrong. In my experience, you want to increase students confidence by giving them questions that are easy enough for them to get right and then gradually increase the difficulty, but never too high that they can\u2019t solve them. It is more fun and potentially more useful for learning to get questions right. Thorstensen also had expensive tastes in coures materials-- we all were required to purchase a clicker to answer the puzzlers with and a an expensive subscription to www.masteringphysics.com. Not that I really minded this much. Overall Thorstensen was a good professor.\"",

There's a fundamental difference between Hudson's lecturing style and LaBelle's lecturing style: LaBelle goes over \"thought questions\" in class. These thought questions actually TEACH YOU THE MATERIAL! Hudson inaccurately assumes you already have a grasp of the concepts (after all, they were in the reading) and dives right into problems, leaving the class in the dust. Prof. Hudson was also nearly useless in office hours. Prof. LaBelle was quite clear and helpful. By the middle of the term, students seemed to realize that they'd learn more from LaBelle. As a result, LaBelle's lectures were always packed with students from both sections. Less than a dozen (i.e. those of us who had a conflict with LaBelle's section) usually showed up to Hudson's lectures. On Fridays, when we had reading quizzes at the start of lecture, many students would leave once they finished; many who stayed only did so out of courtesy. LaBelle's lecture videos were made available to our section due to student requests. Weekly reading quizzes were dreadful. They tested concepts covered in the previous week's reading. Closed notes. Often the correct answer would hinge on having memorized a particular formula. LaBelle's section consistently scored SIGNIFICANTLY higher than our section on the exams... not surprising, as his section was better-prepared. To add insult to injury, Prof. Hudson refused (as far as I could tell) to curve grades in order to be consistent with LaBelle's refusal to curve. The result was a lower median. Homework was time-consuming and difficult but manageable. However, hanging out with the other students and TAs and doing problems in Wilder wasn't too bad. Only sign up for Hudson's section if you have no choice. If you can, keep the other section's time slot (if there are multiple sections) free just in case.\""

The course was split into two sections and he taught one of them. It was very clear he was the worst out of the two professors because our sections median was much lower than the other one. However, we thought it would be okay if we were getting the median in our section and continued to do so, so we could get the median at the end of the term. However, without any warning, the sections scores were combined at the end of the term since both sections went through the 'same' content and material; completely disregarding the professors being extremely different. Therefore, everyone in our sections grades completely dropped to suffice the combined median, allowing for the other section to get higher grades and our section to get lower grades. The section collectively tried to find a way to get help but there was none. There was times were a lot of us were overwhelmed with work in the class and Mueller simply told us 'tough' with a straight face. He also was extremely unhelpful during office hours, which is why a lot of people went to the other profs office hours. I understand that people could say we could have taught ourselves the class, but we did and we still went to class but we thought we were on track to getting the median grade and then we only realized we weren't once the final grades came out, there was nothing that could have been done after that. So, overall if you need this class for your major never take it with Mueller and maybe with the other sections prof - Milan - which as you can see from the other positive feedback here, is better.\""

Take very concise notes. This means keep practice problems separate from equations, and write down the equations in pen so you can see them. 2.) When it comes the the test, every problem is simple though not every problem is easy. If it seems like you are doing something nonsensical, you very likely are. 3.) Before each problem, simply make a chart with each unknown, then generate every equation you can. N equations, N unknowns, this is vital especially with kinematic, pulley, and conservation problems. 4.)

The labs were extremely poorly planned out, 90% of the TAs did not understand the material or at least couldn't explain it. Labs were very poorly made and students were always in a rush to complete them. The textbook required for the course, by Tipler and Mosca was one of the worst textbooks I ever used. You were required to buy the ebook version, but I really wished I also purchased the regular version because it is a lot easier to read. But in any case, the book is endless math equations with little explanation. A lot of kids took AP Physics, which gave them an advantage, although I still got an A. The professor hardly even followed the poor textbook. He assigned readings from it, but some of it was never discussed in class. Without closely following the textbook and with the textbook so shabby, it became very challenging to study for this course. I found all I could do was repeat HW problems and exam questions to practice for the tests. The tests themselves were fairly reasonable, although every once and a while the professor would sneak a question in that was hard but only hard because it was completely unreasonable. I put some of the test questions on Physics Stack Exchange and got people to agree that the questions were unreasonable. If all that wasn't enough, the worst aspect of the class was the homework. At the end of every week you got to look forward to an online and written homework. For the first four weeks they were reasonable in difficulty, but after that they got progressively harder to the point where, unless you took AP Physics you had to look them up on the internet and when that didn't work, go to TA office hours. I only met two TAs who actually were adept at explaining the material. Some of the others just read the answer key and tried to explain the problem from that, doing a very poor job. We ended up just asking each other how we did each question. Typically a TA would explain it to one person and then the answer would migrate around to everyone. Getting told the answer to a problem is NOT how you learn Physics. You can't get told the answer on the tests. While there are some positive reviews of LaBelles class, I can tell you that a huge number of my friends who wanted to be engineers are switching to CS after this class because it was so annoying. I decided to give it another shot with Physics 14 this term with John Thorstenson and am very pleasantly surprised. Thorstenson may not be as exciting a lecturer as Labelle. For many people that means he is not as good of a prof apparently. I think that is ridiculous- lecture is only one of many components of a class. Literally every single problem with Labelle's class is not present with Thorstenson. Physics 14 has a wonderful textbook and after using it extensively I find the tests and problem sets both doable and fun, no TAs involved. If you can take Physics with Thorstenson, do it!

Professor LaBelle ALWAYS has a demonstration that is exciting, thrilling, and related to what we're learning. To illustrate Boyles, Charles, and the ideal gas law last class he brought in liquid nitrogen and put balloons in it so that they shrunk and then once he took them out of the nitrogen they expanded again (the liquid nitrogen lowers the temperature substantially and therefore the volume was lowered). Not only does he do these demos though, but they each have a \"catch\". On this balloon demo one of the balloons was filled with helium so that when it expanded again it not only expanded but then floated up to the ceiling. There is at least one of these hilarious demos every day. There is a classic physics problem with a monkey falling from a tree and a hunter shooting the monkey just as the monkey drops and Professor LaBelle set up a classroom sized reenactment of this problem complete with a stuffed animal monkey with a Harvard crest taped to its belly hanging from the ceiling and a HUGE bbgun on the opposite side of the room. We then \"shot\" the monkey and looked at the physics of it. Another class there was a HUGE pendulum with a bowling ball attached to the ceiling that Professor LaBelle held up to his nose on one end of the room and then let go and the bowling ball swung across the room and right back to right before hitting his nose to demonstrate conservation of angular momentum. The demos are amazing and whenever LaBelle gives them he always approaches with such an adorable, fun-loving, \"i'm not sure what's going to happen\" attitude and they always include fun surprises.

He videos his lectures so that if someone isn't clear on a problem they can look at the VIDEO from class that day. He's also incredibly patient, kind, and informative during office hours (where I lived). He has an incredible curiosity for everything physics related and loves to be challenged.

Sometimes the homework sets were hard, but as long as you don't put them off to the last minute, LaBelle makes himself readily available for help. He offers lots of office hours and makes sure TAs offer hrs when he doesn't. Just make sure you do them on time so you can get help if you need it, because the tests really aren't that bad as long as you understand the homework. Most other students in the class had already taken physics--there were even a lot of kids who had taken AP who had already learned everything the class covered, so if you're coming in without any physics, don't sweat it if everyone already seems to get it. Anyways, great prof, interesting course...my advice is take physics 13. I was doing it for an engineering prereq, but even if you just like math and science, its a good course to take.\"",

Labelle makes a large effort to make himself available outside of class, especially on the days when the problem sets are due. He also sends periodic emails with hints on how to do problems and reminders about when he has office hours. The material itself is not that challenging, especially if you took any level of physics before. The homework is very challenging, but Labelle and the TA's are more than willing to give you hints if you get stuck. The exams are fairly challenging but are easier than the homeworks.

That said, this course took over my life (I was never too good at physics), and you learn to ask for help not only from Labelle but from the TA's and usually from each other.

He also has a bunch of really cool demos. But the main thing I would say was great about the course was that it was really made so every student could understand it. Every homework could be completed if you just went to office hours. Especially on a Monday, which is when the homeworks were due, you would always find a bunch of students outside and in Professor LaBelle's office doing the problems together and staying until they got the right answer. Professor LaBelle also had a good sense on how much to \"help\" a student; he told enough so it was possible to do it on our own still but didn't straight out tell us the answer. I would definitely say to take advantage of office hours on the homeworks - there is no reason to get a bad grade on the homework if you go to these office hours. The tests compared to the homeworks are a piece of cake, and often I found that since I went to office hours I didn't really need to study that much for the tests that much since I understood the homeworks, which Professor LaBelle purposely makes more difficult than the exams.\"",

That said, this class turned my perspective around entirely. The prof not only said on the first day that physics is not supposed to be intuitive and that we have to work at it to understand what's going on (I don't know about everyone else, but it gave me more confidence right off the bat), but he also kept formula-memorization to a minimum, preferring to teach problem-solving METHODS instead. It sounds corny but it worked amazingly for me. On the other hand, the prof can't write clear test questions to save his life, which is kind of important because tests still make up the majority of your grade, despite the labs and homework that you spend so much time on. (And there's no curve for this course, though at least he gives us almost as long as we want to take the tests.) He never filled less than an entire board with clarifications, and you can spend quite a bit of your time trying to figure out what the question is actually asking, instead of how to answer it. That's really the hard part about the exams. It almost gets to the point where you should try to answer the question you think he should be or is asking, rather what the question in front of you literally says. I know that on at least one of the short-answer problems we've had, the question was written wrong so that if you read too closely, you ended up doing the problem wrong. Fortunately, the prof is really good about giving you points back where he screwed up, but you don't have the opportunity to argue when it comes to the final (worth a third of your grade). However, all of these problems with exams aside, this is an excellent intro course. It's not really difficult, so if you're trying to decide between this and 3, I encourage you to go with this.\"",

He is funny, and he does a lot of example problems and shows many demonstrations. He has a couple of facebook groups...which is more an indication of how pathetically addicted some Dartmouth students are to facebook than how good of a prof he is.

Prof. LaBelle was also very helpful in office hours the one time I went, with a teaching style that helps you with what you need but generally tries to lead you in the right direction rather than showing/telling you the answer directly. The homework can get quite challenging, especially when done in one sitting (as I often did the day before it was due). I highly recommend finding at least one other person in the class to work with on the homeworks, as just being able to talk to somebody will help you see the problems more clearly and save you a lot of time and frustration. The tests are actually something of a relief, as the test problems are a notch below the homework problems (you have access to the book, etc for homework--you don't have this luxury on tests), making the tests generally fairly stress-free if you've done the homework well. If one puts in the work, one will reap the benefits--it's not hard to get an A/A- in this course (there is no curve), which is a rarity in most all science courses I've taken at Dartmouth.

That being said, this course is quite hard. Professor LaBelle is a great teacher, but the class is held on a high level, and when I wasn't putting in 100% effort, I didn't understand what was going on. LaBelle will whiz through the algebra on the board. He flashes 'thought questions' (intented to teach you the concepts of physics) very quickly on the overhead. You have to quickly and effectively take down the key information and jot down the key diagrams. I take very bad notes and have poor vision even with glasses (it takes me a relatively long time to see something far away and process it), which could not have helped me, but I think it was very fast for anyone who was struggling with the material. Professor LaBelle is very responsive to questions in class, and I highly encourage you to raise your hand, stop the lecture, and ask for help if you do not understand a concept. If you're making an algebra mistake, you can ask him afterwards, but if you're missing a concept, or if a thought question just went right by you, or are just wondering 'what happened?' during the middle of a problem, do not be intimidated to say 'What did we just do?' The prof truly cares about you understanding physics. The homework sets were very, very hard. Most of them, particularly the first few, involved very cryptic and difficult algebra. Watch out for these, and spend the extra time you'll need to get them right. He displayed an enormous amount of patience with all of us. He would stay well after office hours on countless occasions to help us with the material. If you ask about any sort of concept, homework problem, or material covered in class, he will be more than happy to provide you with a clear and insightful explanation about it, at a pleasantly slowed down pace. It's great. I was slightly annoyed that we were not taught a number of equations which would have been very helpful in doing the hardest homework problems. To name three, speed of approach = speed of recission in an elastic collision, angular frequency of precission, and equation for force when an object has changing mass. Now, these concepts were not tested on the exam, but knowing these equations would have saved quite a lot of time on the homework sets. I would encourage at least some use of the book, although I didn't find it to be that great. You should just skim for the key concepts and equations while you're doing the homework. The reading quizzes can be done without doing the reading - they're designed to be pretty easy. The tests were extremely fair. We had a very, very generous amount of time to complete each exam, which was wonderful. The exam problems were applications of what we did in class, and were toned down compared to the homework sets. I think everyone who has some interest in physics should take this course, actually, just because LaBelle's passion will really get you into it. I definitely worked very hard, but I'm happy I did the work, and I'm very satisfied with my P13 experience. You really do learn the material well, despite the fact it's so hard.

Better work in symbols, which lead you to mess up more. Part II's are also close to impossible, requiring gatherings of students to try to work one or two problems out. Crap! and I still have one to go. The tests: might want to come in a little late (he's very lenient: a test that takes roughly 1.5 to 2 hours he gives you 4 hours for: 6-10PM come in any time). The reason for this is because for the first two hours he will constantly make corrections to his poorly written test: add a negative here, add a crucial given variable there. Basically if he changes the problem before you get to it you're saved a headache. Pretty hard course but manageable. Happy hunting.\"",

Students answer these questions by holding up a card with a number on it. Thought questions are helpful, and the card method is effective because it encourages all students to work through the concepts without putting anyone under pressure. The demonstrations are informative and can even be suspenseful. Professor LaBelle grades on an absolute scale (no curving). In Fall 2004, labs, in-class quizzes, and homeworks were worth 1/3 of the grade. There is an open-book quiz at the beginning of most classes. It consists of one or two EASY multiple-choice questions based on the reading assignment. Professor LaBelle throws out the five lowest quiz scores, so almost everyone gets a perfect score averaged into the final grade. Homeworks can be VERY time-consuming because Prof LaBelle likes to ask questions that are much more difficult than exam questions. However, homeworks are also very interesting (even fun) and they will increase your grade. Labs are described below. Two midterm exams are each worth 1/6 of the final grade. These are taken during the normal lecture period (65 minutes) and many students are VERY pressed for time. The midterm exams are fair, but they're difficult and require students to know the concepts cold. The final exam is worth 1/3 of the final grade. There is sufficient time for it (three hours), but it is also very challenging. Professor LaBelle rocks, but be aware that his exams are thought to be more difficult than those of any other P13 prof. His median grade is usually B, wheras other profs often give median grades of B+ or A-. Overall P13 with LaBelle is an excellent course.

I took three years of physics in high school (without calc) and Physics 13 covered most of the same material, just with harder math, more complex equations, much more difficult problem sets, and a few new topics. Having taken math 8 before the physics 13 was a big advantage. If you haven't taken physics in high school this course will be very difficult!! Definitely try to learn the basics before taking physics 13 because we breezed over what I did in my entire junior year of high school in about the first 4 days. The class was kind of poorly organized, we worked on problems as groups in class, but it wasn't always clear what we were expected to read/watch before class. I personally liked Millan as a prof. It's hard to give lectures for a class when students' background knowledge are so different, but she's available to help students individually. There were also tons of TA office hours where they work through problem sets with you.\"",
            "review 2: \"18W with Robyn Millan: Short review: For the love of physics, STAY AWAY from Millan's P13. Long review: I think after Professor Millan decides to wrap up her career in academia, she really should take a shot at becoming a mystery author: she has an uncanny knack of taking simple, intuitive ideas and details and turning them into seemingly undecipherable enigmas. I have never seen a teacher who articulates theories and explanations so circuitously, and whose problem-solving methods are so inefficient. One thing she did right was her choice of textbook for the class, Giancoli's \"Physics for Scientists & Engineers\", but that only served to highlight how poor of a job she was doing conveying the material. The book presents its content with such clarity that I struggle to understand how that content, when delivered by Millan, became so confusing and convoluted. Furthermore, the example problems she did in class could not have been more awkwardly solved. I would often find in the book a similar problem to what Millan showed, and the book's solution would always be significantly more straightforward and sensible than hers. Her problem-solving demos revealed no useful strategies nor conceptual insights; they were a mere exercise in plugging in orgies of formulae and seeing where that led. The teaching was so comprehensively bad that I decided after the first couple weeks to simply block out what she was saying in class and learn the course material myself using the textbook. That brings me to my second point. If you wonder why I didn't skip the class altogether if I was just going to teach myself the content, well, that's because there was mandatory attendance. 13% of my course grade was held hostage in exchange for my presence in a class I had no business being in. The thought that I will never get back those 5hrs/week (yes, you read it right: 3B + 3BX = 5hrs of lecture every week) makes me saltier than a 12 year-old losing at COD. The course policy said that we were required to attend class to assist one another in working through practice problems and doing experiments\u2014that's a bunch of bull. For one, the in-class experiments were so half-assed that they might as well have been omitted entirely. Secondly, if someone thinks that kids need more time sitting together solving problems, in lecture no less, he must be out of his mind. What is the class trying to achieve here? Becoming another FFB? Apart from 2 midterms and a final, this course had webassign, weekly written p-sets, and pre-class reading quizzes (which I will not comment on since you already know what everyone thinks about them). The lab score came from attendance, completing occasional surveys, 1-2 \"labs\", and a group project at the end of the term (did I miss anything?). In short, there were so many hoops to jump through that it'd make you feel like a performing dolphin at SeaWorld. Of course, the course did have some of those generic plus points, like \"professor was available and helpful during office hours\", which Millan was. In fact, she is an extraordinarily nice person, which makes it even more of a shame that her lectures were such excruciating slogs. All in all, the course displayed no quality that could be considered remotely redeeming, so I won't bother with discussing that aspect here in the interest of this review's length. To end off, I think I've made it ample clear that I have strong, almost exclusively negative opinions about this course. I believe that unless you're a bona-fide masochist, you should not even contemplate taking it. That said, I should proceed by saying that this is only MY view, the view of a mediocre student\u2014it is in no way a definitive assessment of the class. I must also admit that I know people who, to my total disbelief, said they appreciated Millan's lectures. Simply put, despite what I've said about the course, your experience and mileage may vary.\"",

I found that the homework was extremely time-consuming and very difficult, as well. Obviously some people in the class have lots of experience or are just very smart, so that the curve is not as nice as I'd have liked it to be. The tests are usually very difficult also, and often times require you to put together various physics concepts in ways that you were not required to do before the test, either during homework or in lecture. As such, I got a 67% on the first test, and a 80% on the second test.

In my 4 prior terms at Dartmouth, I had not had a professor who I could, without question, write off as a terrible professor. James Whitfield is the first. The class was incredibly disorganized. His PowerPoints and lectures were often confusing or flat-out wrong. All in all, it didn't feel like he was actually teaching and he'd often look like he was scrambling for material to fill in the time. Halfway through the term, I stopped showing up. At the beginning, we were often confused about when things were due, if things were due, etc. We would ask him when lab homework was due, and he'd respond \"I don't know\". On one occasion, someone asked him what was on the exam, and he responded \"I don't know\". Why is he a professor? How is the student supposed to know what to do or what to study for? He was terrible at explaining concepts, and often embarrassed students who were confused to cover up for it. He had a bad attitude about being asked too many questions, almost as if he couldn't understand how people in an intro to physics class could possibly have so many questions. During exams, I'd watch other students ask him for clarification on exam questions. He was very rude about clarifying, and couldn't seem to clarify in the first place. I remember him responding in ways like \"figure it out\" or \"It's your exam, not mine\". It was incredibly aggravating. It seems that throughout the course he was trying to get feedback from students to \"improve\" as a professor. After taking this course with him, I am almost certain that he won't be taking any feedback to heart. I could go on and on about everything that was wrong with his course, but the bottom line is: even if there is the remote possibility that with further feedback he will improve his atrocious teaching over time, I really don't recommend becoming another guinea pig.\"",

He admits to making lectures right before class, and uses that as an excuse for not being prepared. He'll sometimes make offhand comments about how he has to do out the calculus for problems on the board himself because we won't help him.

I took AP physics, and this class is def easier because of it, but not a layup. I think this class will be harder without previous physics experience, but Labelle starts from the beginning, and he\u2019s extremely accessible. He has in total, probably about 15 hours of office hours a week. Additionally, Labelle teaches each unit with a \u201cMethod\u201d to solve - giving you instructions on how to solve the general problem types, which is actually amazing because you will always know exactly where to start and never get stressed about not being able to approach something. Weekly problem sets are harder than what\u2019s on the exam, sometimes to the point I don\u2019t think the first four were solvable outside of OH, but he has a 9 hour OH before each pset, so never fear you won\u2019t be able to solve them. Exams are fair and always reflect what we learned in class - they\u2019re not easy, but if you do the practice exams and all in class problems you\u2019re well prepared. He has thought questions throughout the class period that show what he wants to emphasize and lots of in class worksheets (which are very similar to exam questions). What I actually appreciate most about Labelle is that he clearly cares more about whether you know how to do the problem rather than getting caught up in tedious algebra - I don\u2019t think I ever actually solved for numerical answers on any long exam questions.

His lectures were very clear and he went into detail on each topic to ensure that we had a complete understanding. Anyway, here is some advice for someone taking the class: 1.) Take very concise notes. This means keep practice problems separate from equations, and write down the equations in pen so you can see them. 2.) When it comes the the test, every problem is simple though not every problem is easy. If it seems like you are doing something nonsensical, you very likely are. 3.) Before each problem, simply make a chart with each unknown, then generate every equation you can. N equations, N unknowns, this is vital especially with kinematic, pulley, and conservation problems. 4.) Go to office hours for the problem sets, it makes it much easier when you have some other answers to compare to.\"",
            "review 9: \"16W with James Labelle: Very frustrating class. This class was one of the worst I've taken at Dartmouth. Why other students are so positive, I cannot understand. Labelle was an excellent lecturer... top notch. But that was where the excellency of this class stopped. Literally every other component of this class was almost horrible. The labs were extremely poorly planned out, 90% of the TAs did not understand the material or at least couldn't explain it. Labs were very poorly made and students were always in a rush to complete them. The textbook required for the course, by Tipler and Mosca was one of the worst textbooks I ever used. You were required to buy the ebook version, but I really wished I also purchased the regular version because it is a lot easier to read. But in any case, the book is endless math equations with little explanation. A lot of kids took AP Physics, which gave them an advantage, although I still got an A. The professor hardly even followed the poor textbook. He assigned readings from it, but some of it was never discussed in class. Without closely following the textbook and with the textbook so shabby, it became very challenging to study for this course. I found all I could do was repeat HW problems and exam questions to practice for the tests. The tests themselves were fairly reasonable, although every once and a while the professor would sneak a question in that was hard but only hard because it was completely unreasonable. I put some of the test questions on Physics Stack Exchange and got people to agree that the questions were unreasonable. If all that wasn't enough, the worst aspect of the class was the homework. At the end of every week you got to look forward to an online and written homework. For the first four weeks they were reasonable in difficulty, but after that they got progressively harder to the point where, unless you took AP Physics you had to look them up on the internet and when that didn't work, go to TA office hours. I only met two TAs who actually were adept at explaining the material. Some of the others just read the answer key and tried to explain the problem from that, doing a very poor job. We ended up just asking each other how we did each question. Typically a TA would explain it to one person and then the answer would migrate around to everyone. Getting told the answer to a problem is NOT how you learn Physics. You can't get told the answer on the tests. While there are some positive reviews of LaBelles class, I can tell you that a huge number of my friends who wanted to be engineers are switching to CS after this class because it was so annoying. I decided to give it another shot with Physics 14 this term with John Thorstenson and am very pleasantly surprised. Thorstenson may not be as exciting a lecturer as Labelle. For many people that means he is not as good of a prof apparently. I think that is ridiculous- lecture is only one of many components of a class. Literally every single problem with Labelle's class is not present with Thorstenson. Physics 14 has a wonderful textbook and after using it extensively I find the tests and problem sets both doable and fun, no TAs involved. If you can take Physics with Thorstenson, do it! Labelle is a great guy and an amazing lecturer, but the labs, homeworks, and tests of his class were powerfully frustrating.\"",

This man can make even people who are hopeless (me) understand crystal clear the glory of physics. This best part about class though, is that it's a performance every day. Professor LaBelle ALWAYS has a demonstration that is exciting, thrilling, and related to what we're learning. To illustrate Boyles, Charles, and the ideal gas law last class he brought in liquid nitrogen and put balloons in it so that they shrunk and then once he took them out of the nitrogen they expanded again (the liquid nitrogen lowers the temperature substantially and therefore the volume was lowered). Not only does he do these demos though, but they each have a \"catch\". On this balloon demo one of the balloons was filled with helium so that when it expanded again it not only expanded but then floated up to the ceiling. There is at least one of these hilarious demos every day. There is a classic physics problem with a monkey falling from a tree and a hunter shooting the monkey just as the monkey drops and Professor LaBelle set up a classroom sized reenactment of this problem complete with a stuffed animal monkey with a Harvard crest taped to its belly hanging from the ceiling and a HUGE bbgun on the opposite side of the room. We then \"shot\" the monkey and looked at the physics of it. Another class there was a HUGE pendulum with a bowling ball attached to the ceiling that Professor LaBelle held up to his nose on one end of the room and then let go and the bowling ball swung across the room and right back to right before hitting his nose to demonstrate conservation of angular momentum. The demos are amazing and whenever LaBelle gives them he always approaches with such an adorable, fun-loving, \"i'm not sure what's going to happen\" attitude and they always include fun surprises. Prof LaBelle's enthusiasm for physics is insanely contagious...he radiates joy and excitement and always keeps class dynamic. He videos his lectures so that if someone isn't clear on a problem they can look at the VIDEO from class that day. He's also incredibly patient, kind, and informative during office hours (where I lived). He has an incredible curiosity for everything physics related and loves to be challenged. His teaching style is incredible clear, logical, easy to follow (even for people who have no physical intuition like me).

He also has a bunch of really cool demos. But the main thing I would say was great about the course was that it was really made so every student could understand it. Every homework could be completed if you just went to office hours. Especially on a Monday, which is when the homeworks were due, you would always find a bunch of students outside and in Professor LaBelle's office doing the problems together and staying until they got the right answer. Professor LaBelle also had a good sense on how much to \"help\" a student; he told enough so it was possible to do it on our own still but didn't straight out tell us the answer. I would definitely say to take advantage of office hours on the homeworks - there is no reason to get a bad grade on the homework if you go to these office hours. The tests compared to the homeworks are a piece of cake, and often I found that since I went to office hours I didn't really need to study that much for the tests that much since I understood the homeworks, which Professor LaBelle purposely makes more difficult than the exams.\"",

            "review 43: \"06F with James LaBelle: Disclaimer: I came into this class with a distinct sense of dread because I'd had some awful physics classes in high school and consequently didn't like the subject much. That said, this class turned my perspective around entirely. The prof not only said on the first day that physics is not supposed to be intuitive and that we have to work at it to understand what's going on (I don't know about everyone else, but it gave me more confidence right off the bat), but he also kept formula-memorization to a minimum, preferring to teach problem-solving METHODS instead. It sounds corny but it worked amazingly for me. On the other hand, the prof can't write clear test questions to save his life, which is kind of important because tests still make up the majority of your grade, despite the labs and homework that you spend so much time on. (And there's no curve for this course, though at least he gives us almost as long as we want to take the tests.) He never filled less than an entire board with clarifications, and you can spend quite a bit of your time trying to figure out what the question is actually asking, instead of how to answer it. That's really the hard part about the exams. It almost gets to the point where you should try to answer the question you think he should be or is asking, rather what the question in front of you literally says. I know that on at least one of the short-answer problems we've had, the question was written wrong so that if you read too closely, you ended up doing the problem wrong. Fortunately, the prof is really good about giving you points back where he screwed up, but you don't have the opportunity to argue when it comes to the final (worth a third of your grade). However, all of these problems with exams aside, this is an excellent intro course. It's not really difficult, so if you're trying to decide between this and 3, I encourage you to go with this.\"",

He is funny, and he does a lot of example problems and shows many demonstrations. He has a couple of facebook groups...which is more an indication of how pathetically addicted some Dartmouth students are to facebook than how good of a prof he is.

Prof. LaBelle is funny, funky, and friendly and he's ready to help if asked. The TAs, most of them, are very helpful for the written homeworks which no one could solve alone and so all students went completely confused to their sessions and walked out smiling with the solutions.

He is a very well-spoken, experienced lecturer, and it shows in the way he presents material, the various demos and thought questions he does to enhance understanding of the material, and in the way he solicits and responds to student questions--more than once questions asked about the application of material (such as how resonance is used in a wristwatch) were answered the following class in detail. Prof. LaBelle was also very helpful in office hours the one time I went, with a teaching style that helps you with what you need but generally tries to lead you in the right direction rather than showing/telling you the answer directly. The homework can get quite challenging, especially when done in one sitting (as I often did the day before it was due). I highly recommend finding at least one other person in the class to work with on the homeworks, as just being able to talk to somebody will help you see the problems more clearly and save you a lot of time and frustration. The tests are actually something of a relief, as the test problems are a notch below the homework problems (you have access to the book, etc for homework--you don't have this luxury on tests), making the tests generally fairly stress-free if you've done the homework well. If one puts in the work, one will reap the benefits--it's not hard to get an A/A- in this course (there is no curve), which is a rarity in most all science courses I've taken at Dartmouth.

That being said, this course is quite hard. Professor LaBelle is a great teacher, but the class is held on a high level, and when I wasn't putting in 100% effort, I didn't understand what was going on. LaBelle will whiz through the algebra on the board. He flashes 'thought questions' (intented to teach you the concepts of physics) very quickly on the overhead. You have to quickly and effectively take down the key information and jot down the key diagrams. I take very bad notes and have poor vision even with glasses (it takes me a relatively long time to see something far away and process it), which could not have helped me, but I think it was very fast for anyone who was struggling with the material. Professor LaBelle is very responsive to questions in class, and I highly encourage you to raise your hand, stop the lecture, and ask for help if you do not understand a concept. If you're making an algebra mistake, you can ask him afterwards, but if you're missing a concept, or if a thought question just went right by you, or are just wondering 'what happened?' during the middle of a problem, do not be intimidated to say 'What did we just do?' The prof truly cares about you understanding physics. The homework sets were very, very hard. Most of them, particularly the first few, involved very cryptic and difficult algebra. Watch out for these, and spend the extra time you'll need to get them right. He displayed an enormous amount of patience with all of us. He would stay well after office hours on countless occasions to help us with the material. If you ask about any sort of concept, homework problem, or material covered in class, he will be more than happy to provide you with a clear and insightful explanation about it, at a pleasantly slowed down pace. It's great. I was slightly annoyed that we were not taught a number of equations which would have been very helpful in doing the hardest homework problems. To name three, speed of approach = speed of recission in an elastic collision, angular frequency of precission, and equation for force when an object has changing mass. Now, these concepts were not tested on the exam, but knowing these equations would have saved quite a lot of time on the homework sets. I would encourage at least some use of the book, although I didn't find it to be that great. You should just skim for the key concepts and equations while you're doing the homework. The reading quizzes can be done without doing the reading - they're designed to be pretty easy. The tests were extremely fair. We had a very, very generous amount of time to complete each exam, which was wonderful. The exam problems were applications of what we did in class, and were toned down compared to the homework sets. I think everyone who has some interest in physics should take this course, actually, just because LaBelle's passion will really get you into it. I definitely worked very hard, but I'm happy I did the work, and I'm very satisfied with my P13 experience. You really do learn the material well, despite the fact it's so hard.

They went above and beyond the material covered in class and the material in the textbook, and being less physics inclined than everyone else in the class (or so it seemed) i had a really tough time with these. On the upside, if you find someone to help you and get full credit on them they count for 1/3 of your grade.

            "review 88: \"04F with James LaBelle: Physics 13 is an excellent course. Professor LaBelle is a talented lecturer. He poses multiple-choice \"thought questions\" to the entire class. Students answer these questions by holding up a card with a number on it. Thought questions are helpful, and the card method is effective because it encourages all students to work through the concepts without putting anyone under pressure. The demonstrations are informative and can even be suspenseful. Professor LaBelle grades on an absolute scale (no curving). In Fall 2004, labs, in-class quizzes, and homeworks were worth 1/3 of the grade. There is an open-book quiz at the beginning of most classes. It consists of one or two EASY multiple-choice questions based on the reading assignment. Professor LaBelle throws out the five lowest quiz scores, so almost everyone gets a perfect score averaged into the final grade. Homeworks can be VERY time-consuming because Prof LaBelle likes to ask questions that are much more difficult than exam questions. However, homeworks are also very interesting (even fun) and they will increase your grade. Labs are described below. Two midterm exams are each worth 1/6 of the final grade. These are taken during the normal lecture period (65 minutes) and many students are VERY pressed for time. The midterm exams are fair, but they're difficult and require students to know the concepts cold. The final exam is worth 1/3 of the final grade. There is sufficient time for it (three hours), but it is also very challenging. Professor LaBelle rocks, but be aware that his exams are thought to be more difficult than those of any other P13 prof. His median grade is usually B, wheras other profs often give median grades of B+ or A-. Overall P13 with LaBelle is an excellent course.

Therefore, I was able to follow Professor Hudson's lectures... mostly.... and I did well in the class. If you have no or very little experience, avoid Hudson. Instead, take LaBelle. Professor LaBelle explains concepts well, which is essential for beginning Physics students, and is an overall superior lecturer. If you must take Hudson, get a tutor from the Academic Skills Center and you should be okay. Free pizza problem set workshops at the Thayer School may also prove helpful, as may TA office hours. Most people had a hard time following her. She doesn't explain elementary concepts well, and she'll often dive right into derivations during which it was possible to lose track of what we were solving for in the first place. Watch out... sometimes she'll use Taylor series-type identities in her derivations, and you'll sit there asking yourself, \"Wait, how did she lose the square root?\" But I digress. My other issue with Professor Hudson's lecturing style is that it failed to connect with students. She did not answer questions effectively (and sometimes failed to grasp exactly what she was being asked about). She relied heavily on her notes, which were not always correct (and apparently, sometimes not even legible to her). Sometimes, she went on uninteresting tangents, i.e. bringing up conservation of energy during a kinematics lecture***. She also often failed to do demonstrations properly, but this might improve the next time she teaches the course (it was her first time teaching P13 in, at least, the history of the SA Course Guide). One more positive note is that videos of lectures are posted on Blackboard, so if you really have to miss class, you can still watch later. However, it is still worth going to lecture, as it's much easier said than done to watch these videos later on (in terms of finding time). Also, if you do have a good physics background, lecture will be helpful if you are alert enough to follow. The workload is fine... our only homework consisted of problem sets from MasteringPhysics.com; I don't know whether this will be the case in future years. MasteringPhysics was very helpful, and while you'll dread the sometimes 6-hour-long problem sets, you'll be amazed by how much you've learned by the end. Weekly reading quizzes didn't test whether you'd done the reading as much as whether you understood the topics Professor Hudson had already tried to explain in class. The questions are more conceptually-based than mathematically-based... this is one place where people who have already taken AP Physics will have a significant advantage. Our term, the midterms were easy, and the final was quite difficult (probably in order to bring down students' averages). I doubt that this will be consistent from year to year. We were allowed to bring in a 3x5 notecard on our second midterm and a 5x7 notecard on our final, which was nice. For me, the material was easy, and I did well, but I feel like without my AP Physics background, I would have been hopelessly lost. Professor Hudson is very enthusiastic, and one can tell that she really does care about her students. If you do decide to take this section, consider yourself warned, and good luck! ***On a side note, ask Professor Hudson about using conservation of energy versus kinematics equations to derive how far a moving block will travel up a ramp. I dare you. Actually, no... she'll tell you anyway, about five times before and five times after the conservation of energy chapter.\""

It is rare to find such a strong undergraduate program that allows students to work first-hand with real artifacts. This course challenged me to think in new ways, because we often had to write papers based on artifacts and not just on written sources. It was difficult, but since taking this course I have found myself examining artifacts and museums in entirely new ways. It is as though this course turned on another light in a given museum room that allows me to see more. Course organization was great, going from the broad scope to the narrow in three distint sections: world, Amerian, and Dartmouth's history of science. Readings were excellent, and even included a short work or two of fiction to get students thinking about the moral and social implications of using scientific instruments.\"",

In fact, in the last few classes, most of us relied on one or two people to start talking, and then we'd follow their lead. In the last class, it was clear that only one person had done the reading. Sometimes we wouldn't even get to readings we had done. It became pointless to even do the homework, because the papers weren't even on them. Class was supposed to go from 2-3:50, but we never were let out at the right time. In fact, being held over an extra 20 minutes never even seemed a problem to the professor. I say I'm neutral about a lot of the material and whether it helped me \"learn\" anything because I'm not sure that I learned anything. I'm not kidding, the course seemed to run in circles, but I felt I learned nothing. As far as writing is concerned- he's a good professor to help with writing, but overly critical. One student had written that some project was \"time-oriented.\" Professor Kremer talked to the class about how we can't use the phrase \"time-oriented\" because it's not proper....I'm not sure most people would know this, nor do I think most scholars would know this.

We would often have to read 100-200 pages from one class to another, and over the weekends we'd have a paper due as well (though only final drafts were graded). In addition to that, we had to set up an exhibit at the end of the term.

Far from being cut-and-dry politics, Fesen incorperates a good mixture of science, national and international policy, and history to make sure that his students get as thorough a review on the subject matter as possible before they make their decision about an issue and argue it in paper format (he also does a good job of keeping his own personal views on the topic to himself, so if you have a differing opinion you do not feel afraid to speak out.) A course highlight is the variety of unconventional and seemingly un-related topics Fesen incorperates (the history of Easter Island, a lecture on the expodential function, etc.) that have a huge impact upon the way you look at the politics of space exploration.

The final had a lower median of 79%, although the IQR remained about the same. The median is almost certainly going to be a B+, and she lowered the percentage cutoffs for all grades by 3% since the original raw score of 86% ended up in the B range (so A was a 90% instead of 93%, A- 87% instead of 90%, etc.). Prof. Lynch is also pretty generous with partial credit on the exams as well. Postlab assignments are due on Friday evening which can be a bit of a pain, but you can easily turn in the assignment Saturday morning into the mailbox.

That's not to say that he isn't interested in physics: he's super enthusiastic about the material and wants you to be too.

In class though, I felt that we went fast but not at breakneck speed, so if you at least skimmed the textbook before or after class you'd be able to keep up. The workload: homeworks were totally optional, and halfway through the term Brown just stopped assigning them, citing that we \"should be able to pick out our own problems to do and to study\". They also weren't very relevant, seeing as the weekly quizzes were way more theoretical and concept-based rather than plugging in numbers. The weekly quizzes are also done in pairs or larger groups (except for half of one quiz that we did individually), so if you pulled your own weight they really weren't that bad. Brown also put out really detailed \"study guides\" for each quiz that were basically five or six pages of questions about the material which were super helpful to run through. He puts a huge emphasis on explaining your reasoning - on the quizzes, you are expected to explain every single answer, even to multiple choice questions! I remember I put the wrong answer for one question but a detailed explanation and ended up getting 0.75/1 for that question. The EE's are similar - the first was a written out answer to a not very hard physics problem (what was hard was writing in the style that he wants - go to office hours!!!!) and the second was an exploration into whatever topic your group wanted to do. Final was optional and was really only if you did bad on a couple quizzes. Reading quizzes made it important to show up to class. Overall, not a bad physics class, and I personally hate physics.\"",

            "review 3: \"08S with Robyn Millan: Coming from Fesen for P3 (who was full of himself but was actually enjoyable to listen to and actually *knew* how to teach effectively), Millan didn't stand a chance. She was disorganized, and her lectures repeatedly reflected that. She would make tons of mistakes on derivations or calculations that students would have to correct her on. She would jump from problem to problem without really explaining concepts. And you could tell she probably barely understood the material herself. She made us fill out these \"reading quizzes\" each night at 9pm before the next day's class to check that we did our reading, and to find out if we had questions or if something confused us. This was the most pointless assignment of the class. You didn't even have to do the full reading to figure out the answers on the 1 or 2 question \"quiz\", and because of that, you had no idea if you understood the material or not. You got credit for completion, not for correctness. She said she used the reading quizzes to figure out what we needed more emphasis on in class. But this meant jumping from disjointed problem to problem, without any real teaching or explaining involved. You never knew what was expected of you, or what the point of the lectures were. You came out of lecture more confused than when you went in. Once we got into quantum mechanics and relativity, she actually started explaining concepts in class, and I started understanding her lectures. So, she has it in her to be a decent prof, she just never shows it. She was also horrendously unreliable about practice exams and answers to those practice exams. For example, she didn't *post* the practice exam to our second midterm until the night before, and she didn't *post* the answers until about 3 hours before we were to sit for the test. Then she told us that she \"didn't have time\" to make up a practice final exam; the best she could do was assign a handful of problems from the textbook. Overall, Millan is one of the least effective teachers of the physics lot, and I can't believe she's allowed to keep teaching. On the bright side, all of her lectures were videorecorded and posted on blackboard, so we now all have video proof of how bad she is. p.s. @ \"Solid prof and course - Written by a 2009\" -- I really hope that post is a joke. I can't believe anyone could have found this class worthwhile.\"",

To paint a picture--this course was a nightmarish hellscape where Professor Onofrio was the overlord. This is of course not a personal remark on Prof. Onofrio--but in terms of the course and instruction this is analogy is reflective of the experience. The course was taught using multivariate calculus and other concepts that were far beyond the scope of the course. For reference, on the first HW, several physics majors and folks who had taken honors physics could not solve these problems. Perhaps worse than the obscene academic expectations in this course--Professor Onofrio seemed to have a general disdain for his students. When emailed or confronted to ask questions about problems, he often seemed agitated and annoyed. I know this because he outright replied to students asking very valid logistical questions that they were inconveniencing him. While I understand that we are all human, it really seemed petulant. At the beginning of the term, he made several remarks including \"ADHD is a result of excess screen time\", \"I want to make this course a stressful environment for premeds\", and \"Most of the learning should take place in office hours\". At this point, you may be thinking, \"surely the college did something\". While the deans tried to intervene there was marginal improvements. Approximately 50% of the students dropped the course within two weeks. For those of us who remained this has truly been an exhausting journey. On the bright side, I have gotten to know many of my classmates and have made lots of friends--by trauma bonding while panicking over this class in the library--desperate for help on these HW sets. Many of the students who enroll in this class likely need it as a prerequisite for a major or pre med, or may be people interested in learning physics here at Dartmouth. Unless you are a physics prodigy--DO NOT take it with Professor Onofrio. DO NOT. I would suggest waiting to take it with literally anyone else. I have heard more positive things about Professor Onofrio in upper level physics courses-and I feel strongly that if I had met him in another life where he was not my physics 4 prof, I probably would have no issue with him. Please heed this warning--best of luck.\"",

The first pset and a few other select problems on later psets involved absolutely unnecessary calculus simply not in the range of the class\u2019s ability and excessive time-consuming algebra. It is extremely helpful though that he lets you drop a pset and an in class test (plus he held an extra credit in class test), so that can actually help your grade a lot.

After an initial shock and fear of Prof. Onofrio's teaching style, you learn to work with him. I highly recommend going to his office hours. He's pretty funny and nice if you get on his good side and figure him out.

Everyone there is pre-med, so we all have to take it whether we want to or not. Honestly, the subject material was somewhat interesting (and I don't like physics) and the book is key. Read every chapter and do the assigned problems (which aren't collected). These problems are often harder or more complicated than those on tests, so you should do fine (there are 4 tests and no final - but an opportunity to retake an old test and improve your grade - this is extremely fair and it's near impossible to do poorly if you give it a little effort). I can only rate this course considering my Physics 3 course, which was 1000 times worse because the professors were 1000 times worse at teaching... so in light of that Prof Wegner did alright. The thing is he's getting old, and just can't teach as well as I imagine he used to. He's a smart guy, used to teach at Oxford or someplace, so he really knows his stuff. He just isn't great at conveying all that to students. He, like every other physics professor I've had at all levels of schooling, likes to show derivations and in the process confuses students. This is inevitable - it's like professors haven't yet gotten the message that teaching complicated derivations to students who do not understand the process or haven't taken enough math courses to even begin to understand them is a bad idea.

            "review 1: \"07S with Robert Fesen: Admittedly, I basically took this course as a way to get rid of a SCI distrib, but overall, I found the class to be rather boring. The course outlines the general development of astronomy over time, from Stonehenge to modern-day science. Fesen's lecture notes were pretty straightforward and decent, and he tried to make lecture interesting, but I nearly died from boredom during the 10A. I literally had to start doing the sudoku and the crossword puzzle in the D to keep myself somewhat entertained during class. However, the class wouldn't have been so frustrating if the two tests - the midterm and final - weren't so RIDICULOUSLY picky and detailed in their questions. Walking out of the midterm, I thought to myself, \"Where the heck did those questions come from?\" There was a tremendous amount of material that was covered for the two tests, but Fesen asked questions about really minute details that would be nearly impossible to memorize for the tests - the fill-in-the-blank sections were almost impossible to answer completely. And the median grades on the midterm and final, a 78 and 80, respectively, reflected this fact. However, half of the grade in the course was comprised of \"projects\", which were basically mini-labs run by our two fantastic TAs, Danny and Sara, and discussion questions. The projects, which we usually did at night, outside of class, were ridiculously easy - and it was really easy to get a 10/10 on each one (there were 5 of them), and Fesen dropped the lowest project grade. The discussion questions were in-class question prompts that we have about 10 minutes to work on in groups and write down an answer, and these were graded as well with the same policy of dropping the lowest discussion grade. If it weren't for the projects and discussion questions, my grade in the course would have been significantly lower, so take advantage of these to boost your average and compensate for the exams - you'll probably end up needing to do so... Overall, would I take the course again? Probably not.

Having read the reviews on here before choosing to take the class, I was expecting a class that wasn't overwhelmingly difficult--I'm not awful at math and science, but at the same time I didn't want to take a hard class. Overall, my expectations held true. At first some of the material seemed harder to grasp than I expected, and I became discouraged, but conceptually, I actually found the concepts the most difficult. The course goes at a relatively slow and easy pace until somewhere 2/3 of the way in when it picks up and goes a lot faster and covers a lot more reading. I found the most effective method of going along with the course is reading the material before the lectures. If you've read it, the classes are really easy to follow. If you haven't, you probably won't understand what's going on that well and will be compelled to not pay attention. The best thing about the course is without a doubt the qeekly quizzes because they force you to absorb the material in parts (also \"in lieu of a midterm\") The quizzes are fair assessments of the material if you know it, but being only 13 questions it's really easy to get several (1-3) wrong even if you're confident about your understanding. That said, if you ARE confident about the material, if you are careful you can do well easily. By the time the final comes around, reviewing the material at the beginning and everything covered by quizzes will be a lot less overwhelming because you'll find that you already understand a lot of it enough to not have to study it in great depth. The material at the end might be harder to absorp because you there is so much of it learned in so little time and there aren't accompanying quizzes to study from. All in all, Professor Thorstensen runs this class perfectly. The head of his department, he teaches an intro class really really well. He explains even the most basic concepts tangibly and uses really good analogies to help explain more complicated ones. He adds flavor to the class with jokes (although some will just leave you shaking your head) and might make you hate \"the place that will not be named\" almost as much as he does.

The final exam, however, was generally more reasonable, and a curve was applied to the final grades, so this helped balance out my complaints about the quizzes. The course material itself is very interesting, especially the final section on cosmology and the sections on black holes, dark matter, the redshift, and the like. Recommended to anyone with curiosity about the sky and a SCI/SLA credit to fill.\"",

The interest in the course comes more from the information rather than how it is acquired. Professor Thorstenson is a riot--extremely fun and inspirational--but hour long powerpoint lectures can get old after a while. The key to success in the course comes from the PDF notes, which are available online. They contain beefed-out versions of the presentations given in class, and are what you need to study for the final. Theoretically, one could succeed in the class without ever attending, but then you'd miss all the beautiful pictures and Thorstenson's wit and hilarity! Also, he provides clarification and explanation of many issues which can be very helpful.

            "review 68: \"01F with John Thorstensen: Overall, this was a fine course taught by a fine professor. The class started off slowly, with discussions of scientific notation and some basic physics I had already done in AP Physics in high school. These seemed terribly mundane, but it was necessary to make sure everyone in the class understood these basic concepts. There were a lot of preliminaries which were discussed before we got deep into looking at more interesting structures in the universe. These preliminary discussions proved to be useful later on in the class, but I felt they could have been gone over with more expedition. It wasn\u2019t until about the third week that we got into talking about the actual universe. Once we got to this stage in the class, things started heating up. Professor Thorstensen carefully took us through discussions of stellar structure and evolution, which lead to a host of related and very interesting topics. We talked about general relativity, our galaxy, other galaxies and clusters, active galactic nuclei, the interstellar medium, binary stars, extrasolar planets, and a host of other topics. The topics were carefully strewn together so they made logical sense. All these discussions were artfully brought together with a lengthy discussion of cosmology (the study of large scale structure of the universe). Professor Thorstensen was a very good lecturer, and he did an excellent job of making this complicated subject palpable. Weekly quizzes were given, which at first seemed a little too reminiscent of high school, but in the end they proved to be quite useful and effective. The final exam was a fair testing of the material covered. Thorstensen was clearly passionate about astronomy, and this was evident through his lectures and notes. PowerPoint notes used during the classes were all made available on the web, and very detailed chapter notes that Professor Thorstensen wrote himself were provided on the web. These notes were invaluable for elucidating topics that were trickier. By the end of the term, we had over 250 pages of 8 by 11 single-spaced typed chapter notes under our belt. So obviously there was a healthy amount of material covered. I found this class to be quite rewarding, both in the sense that I learned a great deal about the universe we\u2019re a part of, and I was able to interact with a professor that was so involved in his field. Professor Thorstensen is one of the top minds in the field of observational astronomy, and this is evident from how he taught this class.

We had one question asking from what state the senator in charge of an appropriations committe that gave the money for a telescope was. They did not strike me as being intended to evaluate your general understanding and knowledge of the important concepts, but rather how specific you were in your memorization of the details. The final was the same way. It's a huge class and the lectures can get boring. He uses powerpoint presentations and sticks to them pretty closely so hardly anyone really took notes during the class. My impression is that if you read over the lecture slides over the internet as well as the chapter summaries he types up, you'll be fine. Don't bother to buy the book. Everything you need is on the internet. As far as filling your lab requirement, it's probably the easiest way to do it.

What suprrised/disappointed many students was that he would uniformily reject students' requests for appointments to go over material, even right befor exams and evenif you had legitimate conflicts with his office hrs. Many times he would try to get you to go to the TA's instead of him, however problem was some of the TA's had more than a little trouble with the English language (see below) and didn't seem to know/remember intro physics stuff all that well. 4 exams, one of which is on the last day of classes (he gets by with it only b/c he says it's \"optional\"). you can \"drop\" your lowest score by retaking an alternate version of that exam as the final. If you have an A after the 4 exams, you don't have to take the final -- very nice perk if you have a difficult term. Interesting thing is that there is no curve for the class. It's all objective grading. 93-100 is an A, 90-93 is an A-, etc... kinda like high school, but not what you expect for an intro sci course at dartmouth. however in the end it ends up working out and his tests are written such that the average comes out being a low B, similar to other depts. Generously scored lab reports and very do-able weekly quizzes help bring up your grade. I highly highly recommend doing all the homework problems and thoroughly going over the practice exams he gives you, as he frequently recycles questions and usually has at least 1-2 probs on the exam straight out of the homework.

However, most times that a student went up to clarify something on the test, he gave them this \"You're kidding...you don't know what to do?\" look and then he'd answer their question. The student would turn and return to their seat. Many times, during multiple tests, the Professor and his TA would look at one another and SNICKER!! One or two times could have been coincidence, but it happened over and over and over... On a less serious note, Professor Fesen became irritated in class when students would ask questions during class. It really frustrated him to have to stop and answer an inquiry about a new concept.

I'm not premed, but most people in the class are. She knows this, so she uses a lot of questions from the MCATs, and she knows premeds sometimes obsess about grades so she tells you exactly how to calculate yours. She's responsive to questions when she sees them, but sometimes she doesn't look up at the class at all. About PRS: We used something called PRS, Personal Response System, which requires each person to buy a $35 thing that looks like a remote. I wasn't a huge fan of PRS and never bought one. Fesen would put up multiple-choice problems every day or two, and we would have a few minutes to work on them and then submit our answers using the PRS. The system would graph the class's responses so the prof could see what percentage of us got it right. At first she was still getting the hang of the program and we wasted a lot of time, but by the end of the term it worked fairly well. The system records which students responded to which questions, but doesn't record each student's answer, so we weren't graded on responses. Fesen said she would use the PRS data to keep track of attendance and so if you had good attendance your grade might get bumped up at the end of the term, but your grade wouldn't go down. I think all the technology was pretty unnecessary - Physics 13 uses multiple-choice problems too, but they hold up cards to show their answers, which I think would be cheaper and would waste less time.\"",

I stopped going to class altogether after the second quiz, and just read the lecture notes for all the classes before the other quizzes and final. Millan puts all the lecture notes and powerpoints on blackboard, and actually also had the VIDEO of the class there too, because the astro department was testing some new technology or something. So really there was no incentive at all to go to class, unless you were having trouble with the material.

He has a very traditional means of teaching, and there is absolutely no discussion in the course. The course reading is a book that Wegner helped write himself.

The man knows his stuff better than anyone, but he couldn't get it across in an effective and interesting way if his life depended on it. If you take Astro 2/3 with Wegner, expect long, confusing lectures delivered exclusively in monotone. What saves the class is the excellent new textbook (ironically, it's co-written by Wegner, so maybe he just can't get his thoughts out in verbal form) which explains all the things you will miss by spacing out during Wegner's lectures. The tests are on the easy side, but every once in a while Wegner likes to throw in random TRIVIA (i.e. what is the surface temperature of the sun, what is the wavelength of the absorption line in the spectrum of helium) that tests nothing at all but whether you happened to have picked that number out of the air during one of his lectures. Also, the daily reading quizzes can be extremely frustrating, since sometimes they will be on something Wegner covered in the previous lecture, and sometimes they will be from a tiny little subsection of part of the textbook.

In class time was devoted to really cool and even thrilling demonstrations involving monkeys and catapults, little race cars, liquid nitrogen and other great props very appropriate for Bill Nye the science guy or other educational science TV shows. Apparently, all of this edutainment was meant to promote enthusiasm for physics among the students. Unfortunately, many and perhaps most of the students actually needed to LEARN physics whether enthusiastically or not.

As for exams, labs and assessments, there are weekly quizzes (very easy), problem sets and lab reports (graded fairly leniently depending on your TA), two exams and a final.

            "review 4: \"20F with Yorke Brown: Yorke is an extremely nice and approachable, but sticks to a very strange stance in which he says \"He can't teach\". He spends the majority of classes trying to convince the students that physics is something extraordinary and something that we should all be passionate about, but no one really gives two fucks. If we cared about physics, we would take 13 or 15. Be prepared for many rants and \"Are we having fun yet\" or \"If you are so foolish as to continue onto Physics 4....\" He is a good guy though, so not hard feelings. The class itself isn't extremely difficult, but its not an easy walk in the park. Most of the work is group work, so make sure to get a group of your friends when taking this class. All quizzes are group work, and its answering MC questions with a shit ton of explanation. The explanation is everything. They aren't impossible and it's quite easy to do well. The only bad thing is that in order to achieve an A, you must get a 95% in all categories (Quiz, Lab, Attendance, EE). Quizzes are extremely difficult so get above a 95 average on, so be prepared to get an A-. Labs are pretty easy, and are really easy to succeed on. The write-ups are minimal and are pretty low commitment. EE1 is a written assignment that Yorke basically flames you on, and the EE2 is basically correcting all the errors you made on EE1. If you make this improvement to get above a 95%, you will get an A in the class, assuming every other category is also above a 95. TLDR- You're getting an A- with medium work.\"",
            "review 5: \"18F with Yorke Brown: I'm coming to the end of this course and I simply cannot wait for it to be over. I understand some of the more positive reviews given by others, and I will admit that Professor Brown is much more approachable and committed to student education than other gen-ed intro courses. That being said, this class was a colossal waste of my time. I have spent countless hours keeping up with the daily readings, attending class, reading his personal key concepts, and even going to office hours when I can, yet it still makes no difference on the weekly quiz every Tuesday. These quizzes are entirely conceptual (no need for calculators), yet Yorke is looking for very particular explanations of the nature of the problem. If you don't write it to his liking, it's very easy to get a point off here and there (these quizzes are 10 points each). It sounds like a trivial issue, yet these quizzes culminate into a rather large portion of your grade, or at least he says as much on the syllabus. The only other grades come from lab (very easy), random reading quizzes (also easy), and a culminating \"Evaluative Experience\" in the form of 1 problem that must be solved and throughly explained. For a professor that claims to care about the \"bigger picture\" of physics and simply \"wants to see you understand,\" he was ridiculously uncooperative when it came to minutia such as equation form and font size within a diagram. Basically, my issue with this course was the irony in that Yorke claims to champion a \"broader\" mindset of physics, yet expects very specific explanations for physical interactions. You will never be fully right in this class. Never. There will always be a better way for you to explain something. Funny thing is, he never actually told you how to explain that specific answer - it's just supposed to be your \"intuition.\" This may be a more harsh review than others, but I, personally, cannot stand the prof. I was going to take Physics 4 next term with him, but there is absolutely no chance of that now. You're likely taking this course as a mandatory pre-med checkoff, and to that all I can say I'm sorry.\"",

Overall, Yorke Brown is a nice guy, you can tell he's passionate about physics and he does his best to teach. But some kids are coasting by on their AP Physics knowledge while others are just confused. You have to go to most of the classes because of random attendance check group reading \"quizzes\" (or ask your friends to write your name on their paper). There is a ton of group work, so take the class with a smart friend or find someone who is smart in the class. Partner quizzes and group quizzes are a sure thing by Week 4 or so. There's no midterms and an optional final, which is great. Instead, you'll have a weekly quiz and two evaluative experiences, which are basically papers that you write in a group that Yorke will grade. The final is optional but you'll have to take it if you get bad grades on the quizzes and want your grade on the final to replace your lowest 3 quiz grades. Otherwise, he'll drop your lowest quiz grade. Also, if you want an A in the class, you need to get a 95 or better in every component (labs, quizzes, EE1, EE2, reading quizzes). The labs are super easy. There's only 6 of them and only 2 require actually writing a full report. The TAs don't want to grade long papers and they also like it when you finish early. I ended up finishing all my labs in under 2 hours which was great. The lab reports were not too much work since I enjoy writing. I know I'll end up with an A, or worst case scenario A-.\"",

The grading was not structured. Our second test was canceled and our first test involved a series of incredibly easy questions which we worked out one at a time, sometimes with assistance. If you could roll with such changes and actually did the homework (which was a problem-set everynight and which was the only thing that seemed to be routinely graded) it was fine though.

I personally agree with this philosophy in the sense that the best way to learn the material is to do problems....however, by doing it during class in place of lecture is a really bad idea. what ends up happening is the same few people end up solving the problems in class....and most of the class is completely lost and has no idea what is going on. the other downside to Abbott's method is that it ends up wasting way too much class time, so we didn't even come close to coving the material in the ORL description. ...so basically, if you're the time that can just read the book and be fine, then it doesn't matter if you take the class with Abbott. but if you would feel more comfortable with a prof effectively teaching the material in class...then you might wanna find out when someone else is teaching it.\"",

If you consider memoriztion learning (I don't) then this might be a class worth taking, but if you think memorizing information to spit back onto a quiz is worth doing, then you might consider this class worth taking.

            "review 11: \"04F with John Thorstensen: When taking this course, especially as a freshman it is difficult to find help when you need it. Here are some pointers that saved me albeit late into the term. The prof was very willing to help during office hours. Be prepared for maybe two or three other students to be there also asking questions. Even if you don't have a lot of questions prepared yourself, you can listen to other people and it's usually a good review of the material or something you dont understand or remember. Also the TA's have hours and although I didnt meet with any personally that should be helpful as well because there is an immense amount of material to go over in the class. (TA's may also be grad students or people who majored in the course so they could be an extremely useful resource). You can also get a personal tutor if you contact the academic skill center. It's a very simple procedure and they put you in contact with someone who has taken the course before. It's up to you to arrange an actual meeting though. If you are recieving financial aid then you are allowed 3 free hours of tutoring per subject a week. The material towards the end of the course is just as important if not more on the final exam. Half the final seemed to cover information that we had barely squeezed into the last two lectures. Good luck! Overall the class was extremely interesting but extremely difficult if you didnt stay on top of material each and every day. You could get away with missing several classes because the prof posts his full detailed lectures on blackboard. These should be reviewed anyways after class because they provide notes you might have missed. Thorstensen is amusing and manages to remain fairly personal with a very large class size. The math involved is fairly simple compared to a regular physics course. High school physics should suffice but look into extra help if you have trouble with math because a lot of quiz questions are based on conceptual formulae. The prof is very friendly and knows the material he covers through and through. If the topic wanders out of his field of study he always lets you know where he's not an expert. He always welcomes questions and appreciates the fact that you've paid good money to be in his class. Thus he likes students to be on time so they can have full advantage of the time given.\"",

For one, he projects all the classroom notes on three overhead screens. These are all avaialable from the web, so frantic note-taking is unnecessary. Secondly, he distributes numbered flashcards bound with a band; he asks multiple choice questions and students responsd by holding up the flashcard with the number corresponding to what they think it the correct answer. Since the flashcards are brightly colored and large, Professor Thorstensen can tell when the class understands the material (meaning he can move on) or whether further explanation is appropriate. Finally, the large class setting is utilized by instructions to yell \"SO WHAT\" as a class during certain times, along with other strange chorus calls. The main course material is about 250 PDF notes avaiable from the course website. Know these 250 pages and attend class and an A is easy. The course textbook is supplementary reading material. It is very interesting and is filled with fascinating pictures. Nearly all of the lectures are fun to attend--especially towards the end when big questions about the universe are explored. However, some lectures (like those dealing with gas in space and such) are amazingly boring. Luckily, these are few and far between, and the professor is funny.\"",

It was relatively painless and pretty awesome--I usually left lectures with some mind-boggling thought or question, and half the time decided I should be an astronomer even though I'm terirble at math and physics.

I myself, if I had to miss a class, didn't miss so much the actual lesson (He is very cool about PDF lecture notes online!), but I missed his presentation of it!

He inspired such a love of astronomy in me, that the only reason I will not pursue a minor or major is that I know the higher levels are beyond my skills. However, you can be sure I'll take my second SCI distrib in astro, preferably with him! He really makes the course come alive, and makes astronomy exciting! He isn't just one of those profs who get all excited about their subject, and leave their class wondering what they find so exciting, either. He actually makes us see what excites him so, and makes us (or at least most of us) excited about it too! The course itself is a good one, too, but since I only saw it through the lens of Thorstensen's presence and teaching styles, I can't tell how great it is on its own merit.

The course only had one homework, and a series of weekly quizzes that were at just the right level of difficulty. So, it was fairly easy, in addition to being exceptionally interesting and well-taught. If you need an SCI (ASTRO 2) or SLA credit (ASTRO 3, which is the same course, except you also go to lab), and Thorstensen is teaching, make sure to take this course.

I was already interested in the subject, so I enjoyed learning the material--I just didn't enjoy having Professor Wegener teach it to me. To be fair, Wegner tried. His lectures were very well organized (something I appreciate) and he mixed in a number of interesting examples and demonstrations during class. However, the lectures were also dry and far too similar to the book--essentially, if you did the reading for class, you learned the same things twice. At some points, this helps, because it saves you from having to review your notes as often. Still, during many of the classes, I was very glad to have a friend to distract me. The book is another rough spot of the course, which is ironic, because Wegner helped to write it. It's very pedantic, and not paced very well--the first half of the book is spent reviewing basic physics and general science concepts like inertia and continental drift. Later, though, the chapters become very complicated as the text begins to discuss things like black holes and the expansion of the universe. The book is pedantic during the first chapters and vague during the last. The tests difficult in that you never knew exactly what professor Wegner would ask about; frequently, it seemed like he simply presumed we understood the most important ideas, and tested us on less important ones. He also gave daily quizzes before lectures, as a way to 'encourage' people to come to class. Again, these sometimes seemed to test one's ability to remember a random fact. Overall, I enjoyed learning about astronomy, and even appreciated the review of a wide scope of scientific concepts. Astro 2 makes a great third course--the material is light and easy and fun. Professor Wegner is probably better off avoided.\"",

To his credit, he incorporates in-class experiments, sometimes with volunteers, to bring some energy and excitement into the class.

The quizzes were standard 10-question multiple choice, and he drops one at the end of the term, plus awards extra credit and stuff on a couple, so it was really easy to do well on them.

The group projects are bad in the sense that they're irrelevant to the material, but they are basically done in class for 20 minutes and are just applied thinking questions. The class will not be difficult or interfere with your other courses unless you try to fail this class.

One thing you should know about the course is that there's a lot of stuff to do: four tests, six quizzes, four group projects, and four labs. Average that over 10 weeks, and you're always studying for or working on the next project. It seemed like just after each test, the next quiz or lab was coming up. However, this had the happy consequence that nothing was worth too much, so it doesn't matter if you tank a quiz or two. One criticism is that Fesen seems to ask very pointed, seemingly unimportant questions on quizzes and tests -- really specific questions about things that either aren't very major concepts, or on things that he covered in class over just a few minutes. He'll ask which planet the Cassini spacecraft visited -- is that really important? Shouldn't we know what important things it discovered instead? It's just a memorization thing where he probably should have been asking more conceptual, important things. But don't think he's a bad prof.

I was hoping, though, that it would be an interesting and fun class. Although the subject itself was interesting and thought-provoking, the professor killed the class. He assigned too much work, the labs were disappointing, and the exams were either too hard or too easy. Prof. Young, although a very smart individual, didn't treat the class with very much respect. He also was not able to explain the concepts very well in class. Taught by another professor, Astronomy 1 could be an easy, fun summer class.\"",

This class has the potential to be interesting, and the material is not that hard. However, the class is organized so poorly and the professor is so ineffective that this course is definitely in the running for \"worst course at Dartmouth.\" Lectures are boring. Students are allowed to walk in and out of class whenever they feel like it. Homework and exams ranged from insultingly easy to ridiculously hard, with little in between. Labs are a pain. They are poorly explained, inconsistently graded, and totally uninformative. Despite the fact that this should be an easy class, I don't think many people will be happy with their grades. The only good thing I can say about this class is that I never have to take it again.\"",

I don't really feel like I took anything important away from this class, other than a profound relief to be done with science. The prof wasn't hard, just inept and kind of confused.\"",

He's a great prof, very charming, and the class load is incredibly minor.\"",

This was probably the easiest and most interesting lab distirb I could've taken. Prof. Gleiser is really cool, his lectures were extremely interesting and easy to understand. There is no real math or hard science needed for this course. It's more a history course, where you explore the history of physics throughout time. You will study the ideas of Galileo, Newton, Einstein, etc. This class is basically \"physics for poets\", 10/10 recommend it.\"",

You have to work hard to do well, but it's worth it.\"",
            "review 6: \"04S with Marcelo Gleiser: There are two professors for this class. Marcel Gleiser was WAY cool and did an incredible job of lecturing. I would get very happy if I saw he was going to lecture for the day. The other prof was not near as good; his lectures were dry, not very interesting and tough to sit all the way through. This whole class is full of contradictions. While it is fun and enjoyable to listen to Gleiser's lectures, it is not so fun listening to the other professor. While the classes are interesting (at least to give an overview of physics - which is important), the labs were painful, redudant and shockingly difficult. Of course, this class came easier to some than others - which got frustrating - and because of that, the curve system felt unfair. The tests were also very different from the classes and tested specifics instead of important concepts. While I enjoyed learning the physics I did in this class, I am dissapointed that getting a decent grade in this class is so difficult (unless physics comes easy to you). Also - the labs were graded by T.A.'s which could get frustrating, but they made themselves very accessible if you needed them. So - if you need a science, this one provides physics information that is somewhat valuable to everyday life (and somewhat interesting), but unfortunately - the class is more than just the lectures - it is labs and specific-oriented tests. I guess the professors have trouble evaluating so many students, with so many different levels of capability, but I think they should do a more fair way. Final warning - this class is a LOT of work - do not let the 001 level trick you!\"",
            "review 7: \"04S with Marcelo Gleiser: This course, while easy and relatively interesting, no longer serves any purpose in the Dartmouth curriculum. The only reason it did exist was to fulfill the interdisciplinary requirement, which thankfully no longer exists. It does take care of the Sci w/ Lab requirement, but it would be nice if this course lapsed, so students could take more meaningful classes to fulfill that requirement.\"",
            "review 8: \"04S with Marcelo Gleiser: More or less everything about this class was wonderful. The one bad thing was how Gleiser was so amazing that he made it a drag when Kremer would give lectures - even though Kremer himself is a very good lecturer in his own right. The class was interesting, incredibly informative, thought provoking, and conveniently lets you get away with doing half-to-quarter the labs other classes do and still getting a full lab credit. Gleiser is personable, funny, and his knowledge of natural philosophy since Ancient Greece is unrivaled save for Kremer's. Both of them know almost everything there is to know about the topic, readily answer questions in class, and just overall know how to teach the class well (complete with a lot of demonstrations). I would recommend this class wholeheartedly, particularly if you need an SLA, but even if you don't.\"",
            "review 9: \"02S with Richard Kremer: The class gives you an I, an SCI/SLA, and is a lab. You never need to do the reading, the labs are so easy, and the tests are a very fair assesment of the lecture material. Additionally, the material is fairly interesting. Prof Kremer is an boring but is always willing to help. Professor Marcelo Gleiser is one of the most outstanding professors at Dartmouth. He is funny, interesting, knows the material, and is a scholar in his field, the class is worth taking, if not for all the other things above, just to have Gleiser as a prof.\"",
            "review 10: \"02S with Richard Kremer: Physics 1 is a respectable intellectual history course with pretensions of being a science course (which gives credit for SLA and I). I am decidedly not a science/math inclined person, but this course nevertheless provided a nice \"National Geographic\" style introduction to the history of physics, with only very very basic overall scientific concepts emphasized. Towards the end of the course, things get a little bit more scientific and a little less historical (this as we get into the more freakish areas of physics, such as relativity), but if you stay on top of the lectures (don't rely exclusively upon the printed-out copies of the notes from the course website) and readings you'll be fine, even if you're weak in science and math (the most advanced math you every use is basic algebra. For one lab, we had to use the lOG key on our calculators). Marcelo Gleiser's book for the course, \"The Dancing Universe\" is very interesting and it's a worthwhile read, whether you're going to take this course or not. Prof. Gleiser is a very effective and captivating lecturer, and an interesting lecturer overall; Prof. Kremer puts the class to sleep. The requirements are a midterm and final (I think each is 30% of the grade), a paper on physicists (20%), and four labs (5% each). The exams require knowledge of a lot of obscure details. Good notes in the lectures are a must. The books for the course are, \"The Dancing Universe,\" by Marcelo Gleiser \"From Alchemy to Quarks,\" by Sheldon Glasgow \"The Physicists,\" by Friederich Durrenmatt. This course is a worthwhile course to take--esp. if you're a non-science major, and need to fulfill your SLA and I (and Astro 4 with Gleiser--the history of Astronomy--will take care of your other Science credit). Unlike most distributive-fillers, it is actually an interesting class, whether you're an non-science major seeking science credit, or a science major seeking to get a better perspective upon his discipline.\""
