There were 6 total writing assignments for the term: 3 reprise responses (250ish words each, 10% of your grade each), a midterm essay (1000-1500 words, 25% of your grade), a final paper outline (no word limit, 10% of your grade), and a final essay (1500-2000 words, 20% of your grade). The last 15% of the grade was attendance-based. We had readings for nearly every class (40-50 pages), but you don't need to do all of them; just get a few good quotes in class so you can cite them in papers. Professor Long is chill and very lenient on grading; literally 75% of the class, if not more, got a 90 or better on both of the major essays, and nearly everyone got a 10/10 on each reprise response. She also had a bunch of extra credit opportunities in case you somehow screwed up your grade. Basically, if you want an A, you can guarantee one if you turn in a half-decent draft for everything on time and do an extra credit assignment. Content-wise, you'll go through the entirety of Southeast Asia, reading case studies about religion in each country for homework. You'll then come to class and discuss in small groups and then as a class. Occasionally, you'll watch a movie, go to the Hood Museum, or have a guest lecture. Would definitely recommend the class, especially with Long.\"",

I needed a TMV requirement, so I hopped in this class hoping it wouldn't be too bad. It turned out to be easily the worst class I've ever taken at Dartmouth. I worked really hard in this class. I basically had to learn Islam from the ground level (I have no religious background), I participated in 90% of class days, and I went to office hours on multiple occasions. For an intro course like this, just showing that kind of engagement for a subject you know nothing about should get you an A, but the grades seem subjective and nobody really has a clue. It really starts with Prof Silkaitis. It was her first time ever teaching a class. She is a Princeton PhD student and was WAY over her skis. Sometimes, I was worried about her overall sanity because she didn't seem all that stable mentally. I feel for her and hope she gets help she needs because it was clear that things were not always alright. It was clear as soon as you entered the room what kind of mood she was in. If she was having a bad day, it was going to be a brutal 65 minutes of class. Beyond the teacher's mental health, the class was simply unpredictable. I remember the first day we had a pop quiz on the readings that were assigned the night before and people were freaking out because that wasn't written on the syllabus. The majority of the class is participation based, and it accounts for about 25% of your grade. This makes it extremely awkward since Prof Silkaitis isn't a good conductor to steer the class to a successful discussion. This makes it extremely difficult if you don't have a background in Islam. If you don't have a background in Islam, it's hard to do the readings because you don't know any of the characters, and you won't learn the characters until you go to lecture the next day. The class is completely backwards: lectures should tell you who the people are, then you should read, then you should be quizzed. But this class is too unorganized for that to make any sense. The midterm was 20 free response questions but only answer 10 of them (yes, weird format). It ended up being an insanely difficult midterm, and Prof Silkaitis had to grade it super easily so everyone didn't fail. Every week you have a reading response paper that's about 1.5 pages. Throughout the term, she pretty much changed that to 2+ pages if you want an A. Another fun curveball nobody saw coming. The final was pick 2 out of the 3 questions to answer and write a total of 10 pages on those two prompts.\""

She usually does a chill lecture, then you discuss the given prompts with your table, and then there is a larger class discussion. You have to do the readings (some are really long and difficult to understand) because there are prompts that you answer every day in class on Canvas. With that, she has high expectations for the unit synthesis papers, so you do really need to try hard on those if you want a good grade.\"",

Every class has in-class activities that are submitted on Canvas for a participation-type grade that covers 55% of your overall grade in the class. These are super straightforward, and your lowest 3 are dropped. I also found that doing these activities made the class more engaging. Generally, class is structured either as more of a lecture or discussion, each class having at least one of these activities. Your table is your small discussion group that you stay with throughout the term. Switching between full class discussion and small group discussion also made the class block fly by. The other 45% of your grade is 1000-1250 word open ended papers: basically you need to make any argument you want about 3 of the sources from the unit. There are 3 of these. Meet with Swenson and put in the work and you'll be more than fine on those. Swenson is the best! She is super caring and accommodating and makes the material approachable and interesting.

As long your group submits something for the class discussion, you'll get a 100 for that. Take notes on class discussions and it's pretty easy to write the papers/ relate common themes to the readings. I am not a strong reader or writer, but absolutely loved every reading and every class.

That said, there were lots of moments at the end of class where I would walk away with a great insight and definitely felt like my understanding of the concepts had gotten a lot stronger. Also, the workload was manageable enough, and Professor Wilkinson is very smart and explained concepts very clearly. The not as good parts: Grading was fair, but tough. This is reasonable, but I was definitely disappointed with my midterm performance, especially since I found studying for it to be pretty tough since I'm not that good at taking notes. I wish we could've gotten a terms list or something ahead of time to make it a little less of a shot in the dark. I have no idea how I did on the papers, considering that they were at the very end and we never got feedback. It would have been nice if one of the papers was earlier in the term.

I understand tough grading if it's genuinely meant to help a student improve in their writing, but I think it fails to do so here. I don't think there's a single person finishing this class with an A, which is kind of ridiculous for a required class (first-year seminar.) There was a point where I went to office hours for my essay to be proof-read, and I heeded every piece of advice that was given and modified my paper accordingly. When I got it back, the paper was full of completely new critiques in areas that were not talked about at office hours. I think that this just goes to show that Ackerman (at least for first-year seminar, I'm not sure about her other religion classes) often grades/critiques pieces of writing for the sake of doing so, and seemingly goes out of her way to find reasons to take points off rather than giving genuine, constructive advice. If you're someone who cares deeply about your grades, I highly advise you not to take this class.

The first 3 essays are graded harshly to try and shock you to get to grind on the class, and since that the grading has been more reflective of the time I've put in.

Seton is an excellent professor in my opinion, caring for his students and wanting to make the course reasonable. However, his style of deconstructing people's questions is not for everyone. In terms of workload, this course is not a layup as its name might suggest. It operates as a flipped class, with a 1-2 hours of reading/video lectures to prepare for each class. In class, we just reviewed material and asked questions, with the occasional lecture. All that being said about workload, you can expect an A if you just do the work. This course really alters people's worldview, and I assure you that it is worth it. While there is no meditation in class, Seton offers MWF morning meditation sessions, and you should take as much advantage of them as you can. Important to note: Seton offers a class solely focused on Tibetan Buddhism that gives a bigger picture of Buddhism with less focus on meditation (especially contemporary Mindfulness), so if that is more your wave, check it out.\"",

I was interested in how religion intersects with the moral dilemmas of modern tech like genetic engineering, stem cell research, organ 3D printing, etc etc. We spent barely one week at the very end of the term on these things. He for some reason decided to start at the verrrry beginning of \"technology\" so we spent class after class in boring discussion about clocks towers calendars wheels etc and their roots (ie towers bring you closer to the heavens! wow! Not what I was excited about.). Some kids would really get into it and participate a lot in those early discussions but I almost couldn't bring myself to because it was so dumb in my mind. If that's what you're interested in, great! But I wanted to get to the fascinating new technology. We talked in class about whatever he's interested in which made it really scattered. For instance we'd hear him ramble about certain figures who brought religion onto radio broadcasts and TV programs etc. It wasn't anything that any of us cared about. The midterm was a pretty easy test straight from the study guide- just memorize what he wants you to know about the figures and people like Galileo and you'll be fine. Again, not stimulating. You do get freedom at the end to write a paper about whatever you want which was nice! Generally was very displeased with this class. If you want a class that won't teach or engage you much but has close to no workload (readings are long but you can skim and it doesn't make a difference) this is the class for you.\""

Frankenberry seemed little able to separate her own beliefs from the conduct of the class, which was a little frustrating--but again, in office hours, she seemed much more amiable.

Every student was also required to do a powerpoint presentation on an assigned topic, worth 5% of their grade. Interestingly, this class required very little textual analysis (unusual for religion, I hear) and focused much more on visual materials, which works out, since ancient Egypt has a vast and rich visual heritage.

The readings were diverse and on the whole pretty easy to digest, and Professor Macevitt is a nice guy who definitely wants to make sure everybody comes out of the class understanding the material. However, some of his grading policies are bizarre. On the first day of class, he explained that his philosophy on essays is that you need to get bad grades on them because that will somehow inspire you to work harder and write better next time (he reiterated this as he was handing the first paper back). Both of my essays had strange comments that sometimes didn't even seem to pertain to the content of whatever it was that I wrote about. My overall grade was pretty good, however, leading me to wonder about exactly how much stock he puts into the essay grades that he assigns. Also, he often tries to fit a lecture and a discussion into one period, with the result that adequate time is devoted to neither, with his informative lectures cut short and the subsequent discussions running into the end of the class. These flaws are pretty minor, however, and shouldn't detract from the overall experience of the class.

Professor Raz is great at encouraging students to question their assumptions and re-evaualte our categories (this is pretty much what the whole course is about), and you will definitely leave this class with a MUCH deeper understanding of the theoretical arguments that underly the academic study of religion.

Not only is he an incredible resource, but I really loved his teaching style. He emphasized class discussion over lecturing, but made sure to guide us through a difficult discourse. Also, you could tell he cared a lot more about what we were learning than our products. His comments on our work was always super honest and helpful, but the grading was not as brutal. He was very understanding. I was in the in person section, and to me the fact he was willing to offer an in person element in the first place is a testament to how much he cares about his students.

So, this course will be a time commitment. Almost the entire grade came from a research paper- we had to submit a first draft, give a presentation, and then turn in the final 15-20 page paper by the end of finals. The paper could be in any comparative religion topic that interested us, which was pretty cool.

His office hours were Tuesday from 10 am to 12 pm... not good for me. But he did open it up later in the term so that he was in his office on most days. He was a nice guy... He clearly reads every word that you write, but his grading was, I felt, inconsistent. He said in one paper that I wrote too much (I was at 7 pages mind you within the page limit)... and said I was amazing in the other (I wrote the same length of 7). I really don't think the papers were much different. Also, write the research paper if you can... I think you learn something new and interesting... and you aren't bound by his questions for the essay topics. I will say that I lost a few days that I would have preferred not to writing papers for this class. BUT IT DID PAY OFF IN THE END. And that says something about Hardy recognizing hard work. Assignment weight goes like this If you DON'T do the research paper: 25% for the 6-8ers (75% total) 12.5% for the 3-5 er 12.5% for the group presentation If you DO the research paper 20% for the 6-8ers (40% total) 10% for the 3-5er 10% for the group presentation 40% for the research paper Final notes.

However Professor Reinhart was not approachable and carried a certain arrogance. This was my first religion course at Dartmouth and I felt intimidated and unwelcome to speak with him because of this. He was not friendly or personable in class and so I never went to see him during his office hours.

            "review 9: \"06W with A. Kevin: The biggest criticism of Prof Reinhart is that he is pompous/condescending/etc. While I would agree that some of his behavior is questionable (i.e.: a girl handed in her paper at 10:01 instead of 10:00 and it was considered late) - I still think he is a great prof. He is incredibly articulate, captivating, smart, funny... I was always interested during his class. Don't make the mistake of not doing the readings. At least skim them and then go back and read the relevent ones when you get the take-home midterm/final. Prof Reinhart doesn't bring the readings into his lectures, so making the connections (that are required for the midterms and finals) are all on you. I think this class is relevent to current events and made me a better world citizen. I would recommend, however, that you take intro to Islam before Modern Islam. I would have gotten more out of this class if I had taken intro to Islam first. (I have no background in Islam, so I was definitely confused at some points.) Overall... great class - and if you can look past prof Reinhart's arrogance, great prof too...\"",

He calls out his students, acts annoyedd at honest questions and talks down to his students any chance he can get. The only thing that saves me from failing him as a prof is that he gives great lectures, when he isn't making someone feel stupid for being confused. He tends to cram too much information into one class, where at one point I had 5 pages, typed notes and I certainly did not get all the information he was throwing out. The readings are never incorporated into the lectures but are the sole source for the take-home midterms and the length he requires for such arbitray, random questions was absurd. As a class, there was a concensus that his midterm was extremely unfair and unrelated to the class. If he could get over his power-control issues, he could be a great professor with a great class, but instead he ruins it by feeling the need to put everyone in their place, no matter the cause or reason. He is simply just a jerk.\"",
            "review 11: \"06W with A. Kevin: This was basically a history class. The main text (one of the few texts we had to complete) was very detailed and focused on history. I was expecting more about current events and the factors that affected the relationship between \"the West\" and Muslims. There was some of that...but we had one just class where we talked about Bin Laden. And our class that went over the effects of 9/11 was just a discussion ... we had to describe what had changed. It isn't an overview of the religion either (I think that's religion 8...) So, if you want to learn more about the modern history of the Islamic world, with a little emphasis on current events, you'd like this class.\"",

He was arrogant and abrasive, which is really unfortunate because it is obvious that he is incredibly intelligent and knows a lot about the subject matter. There was a LOT to read for the class but the readings were interesting, and you definitely need to do them at some point, or at least get a general sense of what they are about in order to even begin to attempt the midterm/final. The lectures were basically 65 min of straight note-taking which I personally don't find as the best method. Also, we barely touched upon \"modern\" Islam, and there was little to no background info taught on the basics of the religion...it's more like a history course. Overall I did learn quite a bit but it has a lot more potential.\"",

The reading is interesting but excessive in difficulty and length, luckily you don't really need to do it. Reinhart is a great lecturer, his lectures are concise and interesting. You really learn everything you need to know in the lectures. The optional discussion sections are really interesting and the reading he specifies for them is worth skimming. The take-home midterm and final were challenging but interesting. Also, Reinhart is very arrogant and this put me off a little but he is sometimes funny and its a big class so it can be ignored.\"",
            "review 14: \"06W with A. Kevin: I must give him some credit- Professor Reinhart knows his stuff. He is extremely educated on Islamic studies and Muslim culture. But for that very reason, I disliked the class. His lectures were interesting and the books he assigned seemed cool (He had us read a book of messages from Bin Laden and a graphic novel about an Iranian child, as well as 5 others...) but it was all way over my head. Also, he never really mentioned the readings or related them in anyway to the class!! He did have optional discussion sections during the x-hour that I didn't attend, but even if I had, I don't feel like they really would have helped me on his tests. There was only a midterm and a final (seemed nice) but they were both very poorly organized. The midterm was 2 questions tha could easily be answered in 200 words and he made us do it in 1500. Things like that made the class incredibly unbearable. The man is also horribly unfriendly during office hours (I went 3 times and never got anything out of it) and he only seems to like you if you are taking Arabic, going to Morocco with him in the Spring or are incredibly intellectual about Arab affairs like himself. It is kind of disappointing because I was excited about the class, but the exams he gives are a horrible test of the knowledge I thought I had gained. If you do take the class don't do any of the readings until he assigns the tests! There's no reason to!!\"",

He was also very well informed in the subject and astute.\"",

Boy did this class ever open my mind. Islam is a fascinating, dynamic religion and civilization, which has the potential to be a great power in the struggle to create a better world. I wish every American and European could take this class. I gives the knowledge and perspectives the media doesn't show. Some people in the class thought Prof Reinhart was arrogant, but I disagree. He has higher standards than most of academia (rightly so), and expects students to take the responsibility to live up to those standards. He's always willing to point you in the right direction with accurate criticism. Don't be too sensitive, and recognize that he's not putting you down, he's demanding you pull yourself up.\"",
            "review 17: \"01F with A. Kevin: The lectures were very interesting but the reading was not. Attending and paying attention in class is important unless you have background in Islam and are willing to wade through horrid reading. Professor Reinhart moves through his lectures rapidly and covers a lot of ground. Good note taking is advised. Good notes and light reading is enough to allow you to handle the mid-term and final essays which are about 6 pages a piece.\"",

Reinhart is an intelligent, interesting, and friendly professor who is always willing to chat about anything from Islam to traveling to journalism... Overall, this course was a powerful introduction to the ideas in the reactions of Islam and Muslims to the process of modernization. The readings were generally good, although some were a bit too lenghty and not so helpful. The good thing, however, is that you can choose to not read certain documents if they seem boring to you. Professor Reinhart provides you with a multitude of sources that will help you understand the subject, but if you don't want to read it all, it won't necessarily hurt your grade (although it will make it more difficult to understand the greater picture of modern Islam). Overall, a highly recommended course.\"",

Prof. MacEvitt makes no secret of the fact that he almost exclusively focuses on Western Roman Catholic Christianity once he gets past about the year 200 CE, so don't go into this expecting to hear a lot about Christian groups in Africa, the Middle East, etc. He stops before the Protestant Reformation as well. But the exams aren't terribly difficult even if you don't have the same kind of background I do. Merely paying attention in class is typically sufficient to understand the material well enough to get decent grades. He grades the papers a tad harshly, but they're not terribly difficult to write. He gives you almost complete freedom on the topics of both, so you're free to work with just about any text covered in class.

If you don't know Chrisitian history but have any interest, take this course.

The class itself is lecture based, and you can make of it what you want. If you engage in class discussions, the class is infinitely more interesting. There are roughly 60 students, so I suggest sitting in the first two or three rows of the lecture hall and really trying to participate. Not only will you push yourself, you'll create a relationship with the Prof, which is valuable in this class.

Professor Green is a very nice man, and he is a real authority in the field of bioethics and is very insightful. The readings usually present multiple sides of ethical issues, which is great, but his lectures usually focus on his own beliefs. His ideas are well supported, but just don't expect each ethical argument to be given equal attention. There is quite a bit of reading, but since Green only addresses what he finds to be important, doing all of the reading seems pointless at times, and when you bring up arguments that contradict Green's ideas, he will politely argue his point and effectively (but nicely) shut you down. So don't argue with Green too much. Also don't expect very much religion. Other than the first and last week of the course and a few teachings of the Catholic Church on issues like abortion and homosexuality, religion is noticeably absent. He also focuses on his NORM reasoning, which isn't a difficult concept, for far too long. Because the prof is biased, you will be marked down if you fail to address what he believes the most essential points are even if your arguments are well supported. Still though, it isn't difficult to pull an A-. Pop quizzes are 20% of your grade, and basically each question you miss is a 1% off your grade, but you can drop one quiz. While intense, it isn't difficult to pick up on when Green while quiz you. Overall the course is very good.

Even though I agree with most of his views (not religious), I sometimes would raise objections that a religious person would make, in an effort to understand the other side. Instead of engaging these queries with serious thought, he would dismiss them, as if saying, \"oh, well you don't really understand...\" I *do* understand what you're arguing, I just want to understand what the *other* side is arguing.

Prof. Green's impressive first-week lectures fell apart over the course of the term; they became ever slower, more repetitive and toward the end focused almost exclusively on his method of moral reasoning, which truly does not require more than one lecture period to discuss. If you're a pre-med and you want to listen to guest lectures from doctors, you'll probably get a lot more out of this course than someone who wanted to learn about, oh I don't know, religion and morality. The only religious viewpoint that's discussed is the Catholic outlook on various practices (homosexuality, abortion) ... nothing earthshattering/surprising there.

Plus, the material is bound to interest everyone at least a little bit, since it covers every hot-button issue from abortion to stem-cell research to mercy killing. Pop quizzes based on readings count for 20% of your grade, by the way. But other than that, big chunks of the grade were two papers - a research paper on any ethico-religious topic and a final answering the course's big question. Class discussion was on most days thoughtful and inspired. A lot of people remained quiet because there is indeed a lot of background you need to speak up without sounding foolish on some issues - this is the kind of class that can attract people who think they know everything about everything. But Green responded thoughtfully to all comments, so be not daunted. Basically, a pretty good way to get your TMV. You'll leave with a new outlook on the world and the decisions you make.\"",

Actually, I gained a bonus from the class: not only did I get my wish of learning more about ethics but I have also gained the scientific and political knowledge behind current biomedical controversies. I feel as an informed citizen on biomedical issues after taking this class. Also, Prof Green is a remarkable lecturer. His expertise in bioethics make him a non-pareil resource for the students interested in bioethics, human values and applied ethics. To be fair, here are a few of my \"insider's\" notes: -Be open to new perspectives since the topics in class will be very controversial. -Participate in class but you will profit more by listening to the prof and to your classmates. -If you are interested in ethics (in the philosophical sense) you will have to either dig it from the background of the readings or be very patient until Prof Green discusses it in depth at the end of the course. (Just remember that biomedical ethics will be the focus of this class) I recommend doing your own research or asking Prof Green for additional resources. -If you are planning to take many courses in Religion and you happen to be religious, start getting used to the notion that religious texts cannot sources of moral authority. This will be a recurrent theme in the study of religion. -This course will not offer the perspectives of all religious traditions. It will focus a bit more on Christianity and Judaism (Mainly because these religions have been more proactive in the biomedical intellectual dabates). -Try to understand the theories and the issues thoroughly before you start giving your opinions on them (or challenging anything). -Remain open and optimistic (my best advice!)\"",

We first talk about religion, then focus on individual issues that range from homosexuality to abortion, then look at ethics, then examine the relation between ethics and religion. I found only about 20% of this course relevant. The rest were just case-studies of arbitrary controversial issues. It was random and lacked continuity. 3. Again, if you take this course, do whatever you can to AGREE with what he says. On the essays just take a topic that seems to appeal to him and apply his 'NORM' reasoning method to analyze it. I didn't do this and, not surprisingly, did not receive the grade I had desired. I took this class because I wanted to learn about how religion can apply to everyday situations.

In that end, I believe this class is much much much more useful than taking all the Chinese language classes in the world. Why? Because all Chinese people who are well-off enough to engage in business with Westerners probably speak English themselves. BUT, to understand the mentalities, outlooks on relationships, and ultimately culture and ways of life of the Chinese, is much more useful in fostering benevolent interactions with China in the future, whether economic or political.

Don't expect merely to read the lives of saints and sinners--be prepared for often difficult texts that address those broader issues. This was the first course MacEvitt taught here, and, since it was a seminar, it's difficult to judge how MacEvitt would handle a lecture. The course was often disjointed and incoherent.

Basically, when all my friends where beating their brains writing their final paper during finals, I had already turned in my 1st draft 2 weeks beforehand. It gives you plenty of time for improvement and to settle questions you might have. In the end, learned a lot about planning and writing a research paper. The HW readings were too technical sometimes. A lot of us in the class were unclear about the articles until he discussed them.

To be honest, when I took Religion 6 I found myself wondering for a brief while whether or not I'm all that interested in the study of religion. However, I attribute this to Benor being such a fantastic teacher that he presented the study of a religion to the class so well that I was able to learn both something about what I'm interested in and a lot about Judiaism. Truly an educational experience. I have the utmost respect for Professor Benor and his ability to teach, even if I'm not so sure if I'm actually interested in what he teaches. One of the best rules of thumb for course selection to follow the prof rather than the subject, so I have every intention of taking more courses with him. The reading in Religion 6 is quite managable, and interesting. One of the books, which is on the syllabus to provide very general background information--essentially Judiaism For Dummies--may have been unneccesary (some people in the class told me that they already knew everything in it, and found it superfluous), but I found it a lifesaver since I went into the class knowing literally nothing at all about the subject. The other reading is much more upper-level, and very, very interesting. 50% of your grade is determined by the midterm and 50% by the final. The midterm and final are self-timed take-home essay exams, which are emminently doable if you study for them. Benor hands out a list of questions before the exam which contain all of the questions on the exam, plus 3 times as many questions as that in addition, which will not be on the exam. Benor does not tell you which of the questions will be on the exam, but encourages you to study for--and even draft preliminary responses to--all of them. If you do what he says, and you write intelligent responses, you will undoubtedly get an A in the class. The lectures are most important for the exams (so take a lot of notes), but don't ignore the reading.\"",

The lectures were kinda boring, they just consisted of the prof talking, very few questions asked. The room was also really hot so consequently I fell asleep a bit. I also managed to make it through the course while doing little to none of the reading, i never bought the source book. I read a bit for the first exam, it definetly helped. But I made it through the final without doing any of the reading. I definitely recommend the course, really interesting stuff, the tests werent amazingly hard, and I put little to no work into it.\""

Yeah, apparently he's been an assistant prof. for like 15 years or something and tehre's a bug up his ass that desperately needs to die. His powerpoints suck and they continuosly malfunctioned (he claimed it was the machine but it walways worked perfectly for Green; I personally thought that it was the machine and it hated Reinhart as much as we did), he was snippy and high-handed in all discussions, to the extent that I didn't go to office hours, because I had a class during Green's and didn't want to be put down at Reinhart's. But I guess it's hard to totally blame him. Every time papers had to be passed out, janitors summoned, assignments put up on Blackboard, or things blitzed out to the class list, he had to do it. Green was just livin la vida loca, and Reinhart was down in the trenches, bitter as can be. But still. I had a friend who went in to check her Reinhart graded midterm and he had marked key concepts that he clearly couldnt or shouldnt have messed up wrong, probably bc he thought she would never check her grade, as most ppl. did not. Why he would do that I have no idea, but there you are. Way too much reading in this class, it is for sure impossible, but the good part is that the readings matter for jack until the final. The entire midterm and basically anything of import, consequence or necessity could be found in the class notes. I can't stress how important it is to have a complete set of typed class notes. This is basically the only important thing, to the extent that me and a friend team took the course; one of us was there almost every day and we simply shared notes. The final had some questions on the readings, I think bc they knew no one did them, but they were questions like 'list three reading titles'. The profs seemed to realize as well that the reading list was impossible. Though it can be a strain come finals time, the fact that there are two papers and two exams both due in pairs at mid time and finals time and no other graded work whatsoever in the course i found to kick ass. There is a weekly 1 hr. req'd. TA session that counts as your class participation (10%). What I liked about the course was that I learned a lot of incidentals and basics about major world religions and some key concepts that can be applied to thinking about societies in general (liminal patterns, civil religion, fundamentalism). The class had just way too much info to cover; Rel 1 as a surveys course shouldnt even be offered, there should be prereq's for several rel. classes that look at 1 or 2 huge world religions in detail, and then once you have 2 or 3 of those, then you should be able to look at the patterns inherent within them. I think if you did that though, then you would already realize most of the answers as obvious and the profs wouldnt sound quite so revelatory, indeed you might have already stumbled across some of the websites they blatantly plagarize word for word in their powerpoints.\"",

I'm not sure about the eastern religions, because most of what i know is from this class, but Christianity (not the \"church religion\", but faith in Jesus Chirst as the son of god, who was crucified to redeem mankind) was misconstrued in the class.

No, this class is not a tour-de-force of religion, but rather a types and tools class that gives you the skills necessary to analyze religions, communities, and rituals. For example, the class spends some time analyzing American Civil Religion (yes we have one), and the tools you learn throughout the course really help you understand this phenomenon. Reinhart may be too sarcastic and harsh at times, and his lectures may not be very well organized, but he is an interesting and informative lecturer. Green is a wonderful person who is very open and receptive to students. He is one of Dartmouth's best professors and applies his knowledge of religion and philosophy to many other fields such as bioethics. The readings are a bit lengthy and sometimes dry.

This class is EXCELLENT for that stuff. It's set up in a really interesting way, where it's completely comparative. You don't just have the time divided up by world religion, you have it divided up by different patters in religion. So your first unit is creation stories and your last unit is salvation. Then you look at different religions' takes on these matters, and see how they're similar based on certain models of religious behavior. it's just really set up well. Initially it starts off REALLY easy and you're reading like 10 or 15 pages per class, which was just way too easy. As the term progresses though, there's more work and it feels like a legit workload. The lecturers are great, ESPECIALLY professor Ackerman. She's SO FULL OF ENERGY and enthusiasm, it's excellent :) Professor Onuma initially seems a little cold and uninterested in teaching this class, but as it goes on you see her warmer, funnier side and she tells you a few funny stories. Overall, I would highly recommend this class, especially because it teaches you of things that are really important in individual religions, but that you wouldn't really know unless you're part of the religion. For example, I learned of the Jewish festival of Purim and the focus on \"the word\" in Christianity, which are super important to the religions but not really well known to people of other faiths. Also, ackerman specializes in Judaism and Christianity, and Onuma specializes in Buddhism and Hinduism. The only thing that really gets shortchanged is Islam, which they only spend one day on, whereas literally 1/4 of the course prob covers buddhism and/or hindusim.

I had also heard the class was all multiple choice testing, which I excel at personally. This was not the case. Grading is based on 2 papers (30% each and 6 pages in length), a midterm and final exam (each 15% and around 10 short answer response questions), and 10% class participation in weekly discussion sections. Prof. Ackerman is the chair of the department and teaches western religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) while Prof. Raz teaches the less familiar Buddhism, Daoism, etc. Ackerman engages the students and speaks clearly. Notes are available as powerpoints on blackboard after the class. Raz is an Israeli, however, and his accent is difficult to understand. Both are extremely nice people and I have had interesting discussions with both. Yet, I dreaded the classes where Raz was teaching. He meandered through the lecture and did not present a clear idea of the subject matter. He is very knowledgeable about his subject as he spent a lot of time in China and tries to communicate his interest with students best he can. Between his accent and the fact that unfamiliar eastern religions are difficult for many students to grasp, Raz just isn't effective. The readings are OK, nothing too exciting. The class is NOT a survey of each religion. The course is broken down into several 2 weeks units such as Religious Heroes, Liminality and Rites of Passage, Suffering and Salvation, and Religious Modernity. In each section, different religious responses to the questions asked are discussed in order to teach you how to think about religion rather than just provide the basic outline of theology. I personally would have rather spent 2 weeks on each religion in a more traditional approach. While I will likely get an NRO for the class (I set it to A-), I did work for the class in an attempt for an A in the beginning. Grading on the papers was fairly lenient but many students including myself did not do so well on the midterm. The profs were looking for too many specifics and it was difficult to pull specifics out of Raz's lectures. Since I used the NRO, no harm no foul though. This class was decent, but I cannot recommend it in its current set up. Those are my humble 2 cents.\"",

In that way it was informative, but still some of the main background of each tradition is not conveyed and for someone with absolutely no knowledge of religion it can be a little bit confusing. As far as the professors go, Ohnuma is fabulous. Her lectures were extremely structured, informative, very easy to follow, and interesting. I loved going to class on the days she lectured. She only taught classes when the subject was Hinduism and Buddhism, which was good because I knew NOTHING about them and her clear teaching-style helped me learn a lot. On the other hand, I wish she could have lectured on the other religions too, because I would have liked to learn as much about them as well. Professor Hardy is pretty unorganized and confusing. He trails off and kind of mumbles when he speaks. Even when you strain to listen because you know he's going to say something important you can miss what he's trying to say. He assumes students have more background knowledge than they probaby do, and alludes to different bible passages briefly and offhand as if everyone should be familiar with them. It is very difficult to understand WHAT he is trying to teach and his lectures were somewhat painful to sit through. The work for the course was both easy and hard. The readings were lengthy at times and about half-way through the course I learned which ones were important to do and which ones were unnecessary. The midterm and final were pretty easy if you went to class and reviewed the lectures, but the two take home papers (which were each worth 30% compared to the tests which were each %15) were quite time-consuming and difficult.

I feel that, especially with Hardy's lectures, it was assumed that the students had previously knowledge of religion. Ohnuma is an amazing professor and I learned so much from her lectures. Not only were they very informative, they were also so interesting and clear. If given the chance, I would suggest taking one of her courses. Hardy's lectures, on the other hand, were usually more scattered and I honestly did not learn very much from them. I feel he would be better suited teaching a more specific, smaller class. As for the work in the course, it wasn't terribly difficult. You will very quickly learn which of the readings you have to do (only a select few, especially at the beginning of each topic) and which ones you can skip (most of them!). Beware of the exams - they ask fairly specific questions. I felt I had a good understanding of the concepts in the course, but there were some details I missed out on and therefore lost points on the exam. The papers were fairly straightforward as long as you spend a decent amount of time on them.

This class changed my conception of religion entirely. It also changed the way I think about psychological constructs and the world in general. I would take definitely it again with the same profs but I am not sure about others because the approach changes slightly each term. Benor was very philosophical, he sure got me thinking, and the one office hours I went to with him was even better for this, but his lectures tended to be difficult to understand either because of quietness or monotone. Ohnuma's lectures were very clear, articulate and organized but were at times a bit dry. Discussion sections were more like interactive lectures but they could be fun.\"",
            "review 8: \"08W with Ehud Benor: I really enjoyed this class and think the professors set it up very well. The big picture was always kept in focus and the professors alternated lecturing. Their lecturing styles are pretty different. Professor Ohnuma covers the readings very well in a clear, easy to understand way (so much that I didn't always find it neccesary to do the readings until after class when I could skim what was important), while Professor Benor's lectures were grounded in the readings but ventured into really deep, interesting topics and ideas. It would have been nice to understand how we were being graded a bit better. The exams were based on topics covered in lecture but were a little unusual in that our responses were supposed to be brief, only a sentence or two. The papers assigned were very interesting. Overall, a very interesting class if you're interested in religion at all and have an open mind. I really enjoyed it because I loved the topic and felt that the professors did a great job.\"",
            "review 9: \"08W with Ehud Benor: This class was very good in providing the basics of both religion and human expression and development. It was effective at both connecting and differentiating between the five religions focused on. The readings were mostly interesting with a few on the long/boring side. The two five-page papers were effective at testing understanding of material because they challenged you to apply the themes and topics to an undiscussed issue. You have to think somewhat creatively and understand the major issues at play that you were talking about. I would suggest talking with one of the Profs about where you think you're taking the essay before you actually write it. Grading on the papers was difficult, so it's best to make sure your answers logically fit with their intentions. The midterm and final were interesting because the Professors only wanted short answers, but with the maximum amount of relative information. Make sure you have a broad grasp of the material before the exams as you never know what they might ask for. Try to give as much information that you know is correct and relates as possible. As they are short answer, both exams can be finished with a lot of time to spare. Professor Benor is extremely interested in his subject and appreciates it when the students are interested too. Unfortunately, though he loves to talk about his material, his speaking style is something of a low mumble, but understandable if he uses a mic. His lectures can be long and, though informative, sometimes lack a specific structure which can make them difficult to follow, and his powerpoints are too supplementary to use as outlines. However, Benor truly wants students to understand and be interested. Talk with him during office hours as much as you can. I did at the end of the course and left wishing that I'd done so right from the beginning. He explains things much better when it's one-on-one and he knows where you are having trouble. Professor Ohnuma gives clear, straight-forward, easy-to-understand lectures with coherent powerpoints and outlines that highlight all of the important information. However, I found her enthusiasm, engagement, and expectations to all be less than Benor's. The discussion sessions, led by a TA were fun and interesting, allowing for a chance to really talk about the material with others to help grasp the material. Make sure you speak up, and do the readings before you meet.\""

            "review 1: \"01F with Charles H.: Professor Ohnuma was much more thorough and comprehensible than Professor Stinson, but overall the class was interesting\"",
            "review 2: \"01F with Charles H.: This class isn't particularly hard, nor does it require much work. The material is pretty interesting in general, and you get to learn about a wide variety of subjects, which keeps things fresh. Lectures vary in quality, as some can drone on. Ohnuma is the more attention-grasping lecturer, though Stinson is very knowledgable (though at times a bit dry). I'd recommend it if you have some interest in the subject and want an overall overview of religon.\"",
            "review 3: \"01F with Charles H.: this class could have been good. the reading was really interesting, but the professors taught according to such a formula - from lecture topics down to lecture outlines - that they made it very boring. they acted as if we brought nothing with us into the class. i felt like i was in high school again. they turned religion into memorization of bullet points. it wasn't too hard, but it was a waste of my time. stinson's lectures make no sense. the material was not up to date. i felt that the professors didn't put a lot of effort into the class, which made me wonder why i should. in the end, i got a lot out of the readings, but the lectures were painful, the tests silly, and the class pretty useless. with other profs, however, it could be much better.\"",
            "review 4: \"01F with Charles H.: this class was neither good nor bad, nor did it evoke any emotion from me. I just kind of went on occassion, was pretty uninterested in what occurred, and ended up doing fine. Stinson likes to mumble when he gives lectures, and the lectures are not very useful. He does the western religions. His counterpart, Reiko Onuma, gives lectures on eastern religions. She is very didactic in her style, and the two are basically polar opposites. I learned more from Onuma's lectures. The class contributed to my overall knowledge of what different people believe. If you just want to fulfill a random distributive such as PHR, this is a pretty easy and non-time-consuming way to do so.\""
