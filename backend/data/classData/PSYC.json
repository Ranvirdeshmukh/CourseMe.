You can get away with doing part of the readings because you only have to write a short reflection on the readings before each class. The first half of class was usually watching a TED talk or a small lecture, then the second half of class was small group discussions and whole class discussions. The topics are really interesting and pretty helpful even in your daily life. Professor Detzer is an incredible person and is always super nice. He's great at facilitating discussions in class and really just wants everyone to learn about the topics. He's taught Health Pscych for years but this was the first time he taught this class as a 50-level course so things were a little disorganized at times but in the end everything worked out. The workload as mentioned wasn't too much, mainly readings and a short reflection before each class, a mindfulness reflection each week, then a choice of a 15 minute recorded presentation or an 8 page paper. He didn't really give much feedback in terms of grades during the term, but I'm pretty sure everyone got an A as long as they completed the work. Overall, a really great class experience and highly recommend taking it with Detzer next time it's offered.\"",

Professor Detzer is incredibly kind and cares about his students a lot, so if you're ever behind on work during the class you can always talk to him. Workload was low, the class discussions were interesting, and I found the subject material to be engaging.

            "review 1: \"23F with John Jordan: Definitely disagree with the other review. I dropped the course after week 2 because the professor set unreasonably high expectations, consistently interrupted female students (of which there were very few in the course, and even fewer people of color), and generally came off as anything but genuine in class. Materials were interesting and definitely contributed to my leadership development, but don't listen when he says this isn't a lecture course because he spent the first two weeks lecturing (i.e. just reviewing highlights of the textbook). The one time he addressed his own biases (which were pretty present in his teaching style) was a brief mention of how leadership as a topic in academia was predominantly led by people who look like him, \"white male or whatever\". He's a D'78, and I found him to be a hypocrite with unclear instructions who made me feel disrespected in class. He was also rude and ingenuine to our guest speakers, which was really disappointing to see. I took this as a fourth-course schedule-filler based on the previous review, so I had no reason to stay in the class other than I was interested in it, and the class turned out to be a drag so I dropped it. Jordan pretty regularly assumed questions came from a place of unknowing, whereas I tend to ask questions to double-check the information I have in my notes. Assumptions were a pretty big theme in his teaching style, I found \u2013 I regularly felt like incorrect assumptions were being made about me and I was not given the time or space to correct them. One thing I found particularly frustrating was how he preached about improving your own leadership abilities through the insights of others and yet neglected to do that himself. When I dropped the course, I was removed from the canvas site no questions asked. When I challenged a grade and the feedback that I wasn't making meaningful contributions (even though I went far out of my way to bring 8 separate unique and relevant resources to class for my peers to borrow and use to further explore the topic of the day), he simply didn't respond to my message. I'd challenge something he'd say in class and I'd be interrupted and the focus would be redirected to someone else who more willingly agreed with his ideas. I can definitely see how this would be an amazing course for some people, but unfortunately, Jordan spends his time catering to the Psi Us of the world and if you aren't interested in fitting that model, your participation grades suffer. If you're interested in leadership, especially diverse/inclusive leadership focused on listening and improving, just buy the textbook, skip the course, and find a club where you can create a leadership project on your own. 3/10 stars, would only take again if I had to.\"",
            "review 2: \"23F with John Jordan: Majorly disagree with the previous 23F review. Best class I have taken at Dartmouth, and best Professor I have had too. Professor Jordan is wonderful, nice, and cares a lot about his students' personal and professional success. He is an engaging leadership and organizational psychology practitioner that brings topics to life through many diverse and impressive leadership speakers, creative lectures and activities, and experiential learning. Professor Jordan works really hard to make the class fun and challenging, and he grades fairly. If you work hard and come to class prepared, you will do well and really enjoy in this class.\"",
            "review 3: \"22F with John Jordan: This was the single best class I've ever taken at Dartmouth, and I don't say that lightly. That being said, it is most certainly NOT a layup. Professor Jordan brings an incredible wealth of leadership experience into his class, and he's not shy about it. He challenges every one of his students to push themselves in regards to their leadership ability, and does so through an intentional, incredibly organized manner. As part of this class, every student is responsible for creating and implementing their own leadership project within the Dartmouth community. Throughout the term, you work on the project while receiving coaching, building concrete skills, and learning about different approaches to leadership. You also complete a paper in which you interview three Dartmouth alumni in leadership positions in order to ascertain what qualities make for the best kind of leader. And this class is a real challenge. Professor Jordan expects a lot out of you, but he also works incredibly hard to give you the skills you need to take on the challenge of the class. He's an incredibly good lecturer and a great planner: every class and assignment felt intentional, and every activity felt like it contributed directly to leadership development in some way. This was only his second year teaching the class, but it felt like he had been doing it for decades. He's also quite receptive to feedback, so I imagine that it will only continue to improve. Bottom line, I'd only take this class if you're genuinely interested in pushing yourself to be a better leader. It would probably be a waste of your time otherwise. But if you're really looking to challenge yourself, to build your leadership skills in an actually meaningful way, then you'll find just as much value in this class as I did. It's the best one I've ever taken at Dartmouth, but it's not for everyone.\"",
            "review 4: \"22F with John Jordan: Heavily disagree with the negative review. This was the best class I have taken, ever. I think the reviewer might have confused Professor Jordan being unfair or overly critical with him wanting to challenge everyone in his class to participate more. If you are not outgoing you obviously will feel out of place in a class that emphasizes participation. The class is about leadership, and leadership involves going outside of your comfort zone, and often times, believe it or not, talking to people. Professor Jordan constantly talks about diversity throughout the course and how it is extremely important to consider when talking about leadership. He also brought in multiple guest speakers who represented minority groups\u2026 There was also plenty of diversity within the class as well. No, the class was not 80% female like a lot of other psych classes but that doesn\u2019t mean that it is not diverse. It is not fair to say that he only caters to the \u201cpsi us of the world\u201d. Professor Jordan truly cared about every single student in the class and committed a lot of effort to make sure that we are getting our moneys worth for our education. Definitely take this class if you want to learn about how to be a leader in any aspect of your life.\"",
            "review 5: \"22F with John Jordan: Incredible class with one of the best professors I've had at Dartmouth. The structure of the class involves a) learning about major psychological theories of leadership (assessed with a few open-book, unlimited time multiple choice canvas quizzes), b) learning about these ideas in practice from real life leaders (he brings in a ton of cool guest speakers like a Congressman, high up exec at Adidas, & the head of recruiting at McKinsey; we also did a project where we interviewed 3 very successful Dartmouth alumns about their leadership journeys), and c) leading a service-oriented project at Dartmouth (super rewarding and fun to plan). This is one of my favorite classes at Dartmouth and has helped me immensely as a leader in my clubs, frat, and internships since then. It is definitely a non-zero amount of work that you put in, but Prof Jordan is incredible and you really do get so much out of this course. Loved this class and cannot recommend highly enough!\""

Second of all, he really wants to know if you are grasping the material he is telling you. This man gets so happy when he is talking about monkeys, babies, or baby monkeys.

The powerpoints were very nice and simple. He puts things in green you really need to know, and there are rarely a ton of words on a slide, so it's pretty easy to take notes. I learned a lot about how neuroscientists conduct research in this class. The hardest part is probably the \"Dual Perspectives,\" which are where you have to read a scientific paper and debate with another paper.

You basically get a 10/10 on them if you put in any type of effort. The only other assignment was a final research paper on a topic of your choice. It definitely took a lot of time to write, but at least there were no exams or quizzes. The biggest issue is that the classes were super boring. Everyone just sat on their computers and did random other things while the professor just talked and attempted to ask discussion questions (no one really answered them). Some topics were more interesting than others. Dr. Silbersweig is a super nice man nonetheless, and it was cool having a doctor as a teacher. He told some cool stories. For the second half of the term, we had class in his living room at his house on Occom pond, which was super nice of him. He would put out some form of fruit, candy, cookies, etc. every class. Overall, he tried really hard but the class was pretty boring (which is sad because in theory it's a super cool topic).

Also shoutout to the TAs who were literally the best (Byeol and Arati) - they were so knowledgeable and incredibly helpful in preparing for the lab practical. The practical felt so intimidating at the beginning of the course but was actually so fine you will do great.

He clearly wanted us to succeed and would spend as long as I needed answering my questions in office hours. However, he is super picky on his exams to the point where I did not understand the detail he was asking for because his questions did not specify that's what he wanted. Because we only had one midterm and then the final (along with the practical), this put a huge amount of pressure on the final for me because I did not have a second midterm to get used to his style of exams. Additionally, during class he could rarely answer anyone's question on the spot and would have to come back to it, often leaving us more confused than we started. He always went over class time, not just by 1-2 min, but by at least 5-10 min everyday, which was frustrating because it clearly didn't matter that people had elsewhere to be. He didn't get through a few lectures by the end of the course that we were supposed to get through. I knew this class would be difficult and it certainly was, but it's manageable.

Pfister genuinely cares about his students -- for example he has popsicles and brownies at office hours and sought feedback 2 weeks into the course about how things could be improved. Additionally, he left room at the end of each quiz for students to raise concerns about the wording of questions. Def a great class to take in order to meet the 50s requirement for the psyc major or minor, and a great soph summer class overall.

Professor Manning is very responsive to questions via Slack and is willing to help you out if you ask. Overall, I thought it was an interesting class because it was a unique way of blending together the humanities (storytelling) and STEM (coding, data science).

Many reasons why and I'll explain them thoroughly so that no one makes the same mistake of being excited to take this class or enrolling voluntarily. 1. The class is incredibly unorganized. The prof always finds himself talking about something very unrelated to the main topic and side-chatting (they're not casual talk and still related to the field, but it's very difficult to just understand what he's trying to get at, no matter the topic). 2. His course structure is very weird as towards the second half of the semester he basically asks us to teach amongst ourselves and he barely has a solid lesson plan each day. 3. THE BIGGEST REASON (for me at least) is that the writing style he requires from students is very odd and strict, so if you don't follow his specific style of writing you will constantly do badly. If you've written any type of scientific paper, either from research or any paper scientific, you wouldn't feel too comfortable with it. In short (with some exaggeration for a clearer image), he basically wants you to take these highly specialized psych concepts and write about them as if you're writing to a middle schooler. I really hated this, but if you think you'd like that maybe you'd actually like this class. One good part is that the prof basically does not have any word/page limits on essays.

The only necessary reading beside the two research articles you chose for each essay (which you were allowed to have ChatGPT read for you) was the half of a chapter you get assigned. Then, you have a presentation on it, where you don't have to memorize anything and are welcome to use any sort of notes for.

There were 4 essays (1 graded for completion, 2 essays, and 1 final research paper). For each essay, you were able to create your own prompt which was really nice but also gave you no guidance with your essay. The nice part was you had to submit a rough draft (graded for completion and most of the times could just be an outline), and he gave you good feedback on that. I would recommend submitting as complete of a paper as you can so you can get ample feedback. You also had to lead one seminar (which you can do with a partner) and those were really fun. You ended up spending about 2/3 weeks on just listening to others seminars which was cool. His grading scale was also really nice. It was all point based and rewarded you for doing good work, instead of punishing you for doing bad work. I didn't know this at the beginning, but you can rewrite any essay of the term!!!!

Furthermore, when we did have to think for ourselves in the final assignment, both the TA and professor were out of town and not on blitz. The whole class sat in the lab , at a complete loss of what to do. The only redeeming value for this class is that the subject matter, fMRI, is actually fascinating, I enjoyed reading the book and playing around with data.\"",

Granted, it's \"methods,\" not hands-on, and we did a lot of work with data (generating brain images was probably the coolest part of the class!), but a majority of the work came at the end of the class as we were time-crunched to work through data and i feel like things could either have been better redistributed so that we could've gotten to data crunching earlier, or the volume of data work reduced so the class wouldn't end up so heavily back-loaded. Kelley himself is pretty hilarious--he has some terrible jokes that he inserts into lectures, but they're terribly funny sometimes. Kelley gives good review sheets--questions on the exam are often an easy guess based off of the review sheet, so the tests were very straightforward. This is not a difficult class to do well in, particularly if you're comfortable enough with physics to get the MR physics that comprises the first couple weeks of the term. I imagine next year's version will have some major changes done, so this review may not be particularly relevant or helpful by the time you read it. Sorry.\"",

The workload for the first 3/4 of the term is extremely manageable, so it makes a great third course. The downside is that you *will* put in a lot more time into the project/write-up (primarily processing data) during finals period. (However, the format might be changed to a two-term course in the future...which might make the course even more worthwhile.) If you're interested in understanding fMRI better and looking for a more \"hands on\" class (that isn't super-stressful), this might be a good choice for you.\"",

The tests were super reasonable and not too hard to study for since he told us what would be on the test.\""

This is one of the few classes I've taken at Dartmouth that I know will have a direct impact on my real life. The problem with the class is there is just way too much material to cover in 9 weeks and Van Horn expected way too much out of you. The upside, at the end of all the stress you've actually learned a lot about fMRI, a topic that most undergraduates don't get to experience at other schools. Emily Cross, our TA, is amazing! She saved us!\"",
            "review 2: \"06W with John D.: Like a lot of the other reviews have said, this course is amazing because of what it offers you to learn - I don't know of any other place that gives undergrads the chance to learn how to use fMRI hands on like this. That said, I was really disappointed with Van Horn's teaching style. He's a competent lecturer with lots of experience and an obvious love of the subject, but he consistently failed to keep the students' needs in mind - i.e., the syllabus was completely useless, lectures repeatedly (especially in labs) ran over time, our final paper topic concerned his own research interests rather than assessing how well we'd learned to collect and process MRI data... Labs were by far the most frustrating aspect of the course. It's true that you don't need any LINUX or similar computer experience to learn to process MRI data, but Van Horn taught by spouting off lists of processing steps without stopping to explain many of them or assist struggling groups. More advanced steps in processing (like creating images) that he later graded harshly were not given nearly enough time or explanation. Mishaps that occurred in processing often could have been prevented with a bit more foresight and explanation on the part of the professor. He often did not seem aware that the few students who really excelled in data analysis had strong computer backgrounds and did not represent the skills of the entire class. Scheduling was a nightmare: our final presentations were cancelled at the last minute because Van Horn didn't realize there was only one week left in the term. He also attempted to give us a quiz after the end-of-term testing deadline. My advice: take the class anyway, because the material's awesome. Scribble down everything you can during lab, prepare to have your time wasted (Thursday's 2-hour class was devoted to scanning, so everyone had to sit in the scanner control room and do nothing while one person scanned another), don't worry about watching the videos, make sure your lab group has people you trust to work with, and ASK QUESTIONS, otherwise you probably won't get yours answered. Also, hope for a good TA - Emily Cross did an amazing job of trying to fill in the gaps Van Horn left.\"",

Prof. Van Horn really loves this subject and is readily available outside of class to help you. That being said, this course is a ton of work and requires a lot of patience (especially with computers). The midterm and the final are seemingly endless projects, and in the first half of the course there are several hours of videos to watch each week. If you have the time and the interest, the class can be very rewarding...just know what you're getting yourself into.\"",

That said, it is A LOT of work. Not only are there tests every two weeks (each covering lectures, study guides for four book chapters, and four videos that you have to watch outside of class @ over an hour each), there is also a large midterm report (group) and final report (individual). In addition to this, you need to spend a lot of time outside of class in the lab processing data (some students spent over 60 hours during the term). Definitely take this during a term where you have a lighter course load or extra free time.\"",

I was hesitant taking a course with a researcher, but Prof. Van Horn turned out to be one of the best profs in the department. He knows his material extremely well and communicates his love for it balanced with a healthy dose of skepticism. The exams (\"quizzes\") can be intimidating at first, but are actually completey doable and everyone does well. The projects are extremely time consuming, but ultimately very rewarding. The course is disorganized (throw out the timeline the minute you get it, the actual class will be completely different), but then again, that's the way real research works. There are some videos he assigns, but they aren't necessary to do well on the quizzes--just look at the slides provided with them and you will save hours. Overall, great class, and everyone got gift certificates at the end!\""

You stop having lectures halfway through the term because we break for presentations of our term projects, which are just a quick lit review, essentially, on some broad topic of your choice. There's also a self-analysis early on, in which you and a classmate are videotaped having a short conversation and you have to write it up briefly, pointing out your non-verbal behavior. Very easy.

            "review 1: \"08S with Catherine Norris: When I was looking for social psych seminars, I was debating between this and Hull's Interpersonal Relationships. At the end of the day, I figured that while both had the potential to be interesting, this one would be more applicable both in job applications as well as once you're out there in the real world. Take this into consideration when debating over which seminars to take. As I knew nothing about Professor Norris, or much about the class beyond what the ORC talked about, I was pretty nervous entering the class. The reading in particular looked pretty daunting. Fortunately, though, the reading would never be too heavy, especially since Professor Norris would often allow us to choose from a selection. Although the course content was interesting overall, naturally how engaged you were in the topics would vary based on what we're talking about (although some were pleasant surprises). While a strength of the course is that it spans a bunch of those topics (the research, and the applied, including stuff regarding politics and marketing/branding), some of those applied topics felt a bit rushed since we'd often only have one day to focus on something. The class on a whole was very motivated to participate and discuss the topics, which was a plus. For better or for worse, however, a lot of times the class did digress to advertising topics (namely, commercials). The assignments were as follows: - 10/13 one-page responses to the readings, due the night before class; if you do more than the required 10, she drops the lowest scored responses - leading two discussions with another student - a 7-page midterm paper where you essentially make up an experiment and do the full write-up on it (background research, procedure, implications, etc.), where you essentially make up the data - a 10-page final paper where you can further explore any related topic you'd like, or actually conduct the study you made up for the midterm Note that all of these assignments test analysis, and not recall (no tests!). So for those who love papers and hate tests, this course is a perfect fit. None of the assignments were too difficult. While naturally it gets annoying to submit response papers the 5pm the night before class, the response papers encourage you to engage yourself in the material, and try to shed some insight. Leading a discussion is all right, especially when you make it applicable and even insert some activity. The midterm assignment goes by quickly once you figure out what you're writing on and conduct the background research. The final assignment, for which a draft is due before classes ends, can be as epic as you'd like it to be: some students relied a lot on in-class readings, whereas others conducted a good amount of additional research. Since you have a lot of latitude in choosing what your midterm and final assignment topics focus on, you can look into something you're truly passionate about - or at least something you'd find easy to research. For example, particularly with the final project a lot of students analyzed advertising campaigns, while others looked at experimental procedures. Professor Norris is a good professor, and I hope she teaches at Dartmouth for years to come. Her lectures remind me of Hull's or Wolford's - it's not that any one of them is inherently an engrossing showman of a presenter/speaker, but rather they all enjoy the material and always have interesting things to talk about. (She also talks about her personal preference, so she would talk about her political leanings once in a while.) Norris was able to modify the course throughout the term to tailor it to students' interests, and despite her busy schedule always made time so students could meet with her. The 2A class would have the first hour devoted to lecture, and the next to discussion. Norris would often overprepare, so the lectures would unfortunately frequently be cut short. While she knew more about the attitudes literature (which was very impressive) than the more applicable persuasion half of the course, she invites several guest speakers from the Hanover area (for us, two professors and a businesswoman) to help cover that. While this course will unfortunately not be offered in the '08-'09 year, I highly recommend it for the next time it is offered.\""

A lot of the material was interesting but very repetitive and he has a tendency to spend the first 30 min on material covered in the last class. He's so sweet, but he is a little old, so his voice inflections were nonexistent and lectures tended to be pretty monotone. If you pay attention and are interested in face perceptions, you have the potential to learn a lot. I tended to zone out, so I learned minimal amounts. Workload: Very easy. Around 1-4 readings each week (ranging in length), and to be honest, you don't really have to do it. He said we would have a weekly question each week, but only ended up sending around 3 in total. We had an online midterm (1 hr 5 min and 9 short answer questions). We also had an online final that he forgot to post so we ended up having 4pm-8pm to complete 9 short answer questions. Then we had a paper which was supposed to be 5-10 pages, then was shortened to 3-4 pages outlining a research proposal. Over all: Layup.

Meanwhile, prof. Finn is doing zero work, falls behind on grading and outsources all of her work to her poor TA who she makes grade like 60 pages of writing per week. Good thing is though, there are no tests so you're really not responsible for learning or engaging with any of the material anyway. If you want an easy GPA boost this class may do the trick but the pain you will have to endure sitting through this class four times per week (she uses all x-hours and grades attendance!) is no joke and should be weighed seriously.

The twist in all of this comes at the end when those seven layers are not covered on the exam, presumably the assumption is if she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain it in 4 goes we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly understand it. While this is a nice perspective and the level of detail expected in exam answers was more than fair the lectures ended up feeling like a waste\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 why after all talk about something four times if mastery wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that important after all? The basic problem here is that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying so hard to help us out, be fair, and make sure we know it that she ends up making the class painfully slow. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to you to decide if slow but kind and careful is the lesser evil than spray and pray teaching. The class has two midterms and a final (2/3s of the info from the last third of the class the rest from the first 2/3s of the course), and two papers. The papers were not hard; however, the topics were made less clear by excessive explanation and reiteration. (Pattern?) Finally the prof has what appears to be significant clinical experience and background with split brains. This makes for a very interesting and different perspective in a department that seems increasingly interested in mice and electrodes. However, this is her ONLY perspective and as a result almost every topic covered in the class comes back to splits. While this review may sound really negative I did say the class was an A-/B+. While it is slow and fixated on splits the material is very interesting and the prof makes each class worth coming to (cool clinical videos etc). This would be a great 3rd class for an athlete or a good easy fourth class (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a good deal of psyc background already).

As far as lecturing, Muir isn't bad, he's just very straightforward, going through powerpoint lectures and editiorializing only to throw in some corny jokes from time to time. Prof Muir's overall nice-guy demeanor, easy grading of written assignments, and the fact that the course covers some pretty complex processes but also covers much more simple concepts, led me to believe that the exams would be not-too challenging. Boy, was I wrong. The multiple-choice essay Q's test your memory of specific brain areas, experiments, and menial neurobiological processes, not overall concepts. And the essay questions, for some reason worth much more than the collective value of the multiple choice questions, are just plain screwy. They do not require a well-thought out, well-crafted explanation of your understanding of the course material, but rather a complete regurgitation of certain concepts and phrases that the Prof happens to have on a checklist. That's right, if you don't happen to guess exactly what the professor has written to himself, you will not get an A. So you could potentially write a really good essay, that only specifically mentions 50% of the concepts or terms on the Prof's little checklist, and you will get an F. Muir, a new prof whose first teaching experience was this class, seems oblivious to what he can realistically expect from students, and what he can't. He doesn't know how to teach and evaluate the important things of the course, and instead tends to focus on the menial aspects of it, especially on his exams.

These quizzes usually were pretty specific, so it isn't necessarily the easy A you would imagine them to be. We then have activity papers that were genuinely so easy I feel like an 8th grader could have written them. Throughout the term, you have to fill out 20 emotion diary entries which is worth 5% and these are easy points as long as you do 20 entries. Do them in the beginning so you don't forget!

The material is both fascinating and challenging, and the course is structured such that the first part is mostly biology, the second part maths, and the third coding, meaning that, depending on your background, it will be a rollercoaster. If you're into biology, it will get progressively harder and harder. If you're into maths, you get to rest for three weeks in the middle as the prof explains matrix multiplication. And if you're a computer person, then you'll start off wondering what the fuck is happening and then end off in familiar territory. Although the TA was mostly confused and unhelpful, the real selling point of this course is Prof Granger himself. He is very knowledgeable about the material, which is interesting enough on its own, but Granger's theatrical lecturing style only serves to enhance it. He fills his lectures with fun facts, anecdotes, and interesting analogies, which might mean that they are more meandering and exploratory than your average university lecture, but it also means they are a joy to listen to. I'm interested to see that not many people seem to appreciate his weary, cynical, and slightly absurd sense of humour, which to me was always a highlight. Personally, I think if you pay close enough attention in class and take lots of notes, you can very easily ace the exams, as they are not particularly difficult as much as they are lengthy. If you'd like to learn more about the brain and don't mind a bit of unorthodox rhetorical flair in the lecture hall, I strongly advise you to take this course!\"",

This was really unfortunate since I looked forward to this course a lot and thought the material itself had a lot of potential. Overall, the course was very unstructured and disorganized. We rarely followed the schedule in the syllabus since lectures were usually scrambled and disorganized. Lectures were sometimes painful to sit through since it involved a lot of the professor rambling about how his colleagues were doing things wrong and/or involved a lot of sarcastic, unprofessional humor. Additionally, the readings that were on the syllabus were difficult to find on Canvas or weren't there at all. The lab also did not really help with improving understanding of class material. Also, the professor was not very accessible to ask questions. Office hours were on Zoom, but the day and time for it was not clearly communicated with the class. Directions for the lab assignment and the final project were unclear, but it was difficult to ask the professor and TA questions about those assignments. Asking the professor questions was also uncomfortable since he would sometimes respond condescendingly, or in a way that questioned why I didn't understand the material right away. Since the professor never communicated with us how we would be assessed, I have no idea how I performed in the class. Additionally, towards the end of the course, certain grades were removed or made unviewable on Canvas without explanation, further making me feel unclear and confused about where I stood in the course. We had 2 midterms, 1 final exam, 1 lab assignment, and 1 final project that we were graded on, though it was unclear to me whether the class is curved or not. The saving grace was that the class was recorded so I could at least go back and try to figure out what the lectures were about. If I could redo this term, I would have just chosen a different comp sci or neuro or cog sci class.\"",

Adding to that was the fact that most of the people in this class, if you are a freshman, will be older than you (some graduate students) which adds to the intimidation factor at the beginning. That's why I recommend you not to take this course if you are a freshman. If you are NOT a freshman, you are crazy if you do not take this course with this teacher.

His lectures are disorganized, he makes frequent mistakes, and he doesn't seem to take the class very seriously. Worst, he is NOT available outside of class. He has office hours, but he will act like he has better things to do if you show up.

Indeed, there were grad students, and true, the material itself is complicated (especially the readings that you thankfully don't actually have to do), but Granger does a really good job of simplifying things and taking them piece by piece. The scope of the class can be seen as a strength or a weakness. The interdisciplinary nature basically allowed me to check out two aspects of Dartmouth's curriculum with one course (incidentally, I'm really not into neurobiology but enjoy the computer aspects a lot); however, the breadth of material sometimes made it hard to understand the connections between the information. Nevertheless, I was always surprised at how we covered so much interesting stuff with so little work. Don't be scared off by the name - this was a solid course.\"",

But from the first day of class, I realized it wasn't going to be nearly as interesting as I first thought. Prof Granger was nice enough, but I felt babied by the pace and content of the lectures. Granger took 2 hours to describe something that should have taken 15 minutes, and his random and pointless digressions didn't help speed up class either. I did learn a lot about neural networks, but I feel like I could have learned so much more. That said, the class was also extremely easy. I barely studied for tests and still made great grades. Even though I attended most of the lectures, it probably isn't necessary. So in conclusion, if you're looking for an easy blow-off class to balance out an otherwise difficult schedule, by all means you should take this class.

I would say if you have a neuro background, like have taken Psyc 6, this class may be easier for you. If you haven't, it'll be a lot more difficult. There's a lot of memorization for the tests, so be prepared. Also, the medians were not at an A-...they were lower, like in the mid-B range.\"",

            "review 4: \"09W with Catherine Cramer: Cramer's a decent professor, and this a decent course, but how much you'll enjoy it depends on your background. As Neuroscience major, I found a lot of this course to be a very broad review, mostly of Psyc 6 material. Cramer's discussions of things like the action potential, synaptic transmission, LTP, etc. are full of simplifications and mistakes. If you haven't taken Psyc 6, you won't mind; if you have, you'll find this part frustrating. What separates this course from Psyc 6 is the more physiological (as opposed to neurological) bent of the material. For example, you'll read a lot about hormonal control of a variety of systems. This is new and interesting, but there's not enough of it, and we didn't go into much depth in any topic. Cramer's alright - she seems to care a lot about the material, and is very enthusiastic. On the first day, she was almost hyperventilating with her excitement about teaching this course! That said, she needs to brush up on some basic neuroscience - she seemed confused by a few of the concepts related to neural transmission and LTP. Tests were quite easy, with medians usually around 90. Just learn all the facts and you'll be fine.\"",
            "review 5: \"09W with Catherine Cramer: The material that we covered in this class was really interesting, but the assessment was frustrating. It was purely memorization (multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank), and covered not only the lecture material but all the content of the textbook as well. Prof. Cramer did a good job during lectures, but in order to do well you need to spend a lot of time memorizing the entire textbook, which is daunting if you don't have any background in biology/neuroscience.\"",

I am pleased with the way the course went but certainly had to put a lot of work into it. This is the kind of course where the difference between the B and the A is a lot of studying. If you're interested in the brain, then this is a great course. If not, it probably isn't the course for you.\"",

It's a pretty good overview of physiological psychology (which does include a great deal of comparative--that is, non-human--physiology). Cramer gives fairly good lectures but doesn't do as well answering questions. Her office hours are early in the morning; the TA is more accessible. Tests are fair, and you get to drop the lowest grade. It's not life-changing, but it's a solid class.\"",

If you haven't seen any of the material before, it's going to be harder. But even if you have only taken psych 6, quite a bit of it will be review. other people have complained that prof. Cramer is difficult to follow during class. I didn't find this to be the case, but I would definitely recommend doing all the reading before class.\"",

This course is best suited for pre-med people or neuroscience majors because the material is very dense. And it helps to have a previous experience with some of the information covered. Overall, it's a great class, but very challenging. So be prepared to work hard for this one if science isn't your forte.\"",

Also, the lectures were very fast paced, to the extent that most students had difficulty taking notes. The tests were multiple choice questions, and tested memorization more than understanding.

Professor Cramer has been teaching this class for over 20 years and really tries to help you understand the material if you ask her a question or go to her for help. The lectures are very fast-paced. Often I will be so caught up in taking notes in class and need to go over the lectures every night to understand what we learned. There is alot of memorization, but there's no way around that.

However, I would imagine that it might be more challenging for someone without such a strong background in biology. Professor Cramer definitely knew and was very interested in the material at hand, and the lectures typically revolved around and clarified the textbook reading, which was helpful but also a bit redundant. Also, although I didn't use office hours, she seemed very approachable and always wanted to help students understand the material. There were 5 exams (3 during the course, 2 during finals, one which of which is cumulative); you can even drop one exam, which is a very nice option. Personally, I thought the exams and grades were very fair, especially since Prof. Cramer seemed aware a lot of students weren't familiar with the material and simply took this class for the psych major requirement.\"",

The tests always seemed like they weren't too bad, but then it was a lot easier to lose points that it seemed initially.

Cramer gives clear and interesting lectures, and is a really nice prof outside of the classroom (although I never went to office hours). The material is also really interesting, even if one is not inclined towards neuroscience. I'm certainly not. The class seems to be a mixed bag, though. I had a really fun time with it; the class isn't \"easy,\" but more than manageable if you put the work into it. Others I know didn't seem to feel the same. In my opinion, as long as you pay attention during class and do the readings, you'll do more than fine. (I got an A... one of only two A's for my major that I've gotten my entire time here.)

Even if you had not taken any biology course in high school, the material itself is not too difficult since the course focuses on the generalization of each sensory system. Professor Cramer was very organized and clear during her lectures. Her office hours were very helpful since she was very welcoming. I found out that if you wrote all of the important information on the review outlines, then this is enough to do well in the course. Just put in the time and you will do well. Great course.

The tests aren't terrible, but are not always the best representation of what was emphasized in class or what seems to be the general ideas. They got a bit too much into knit picky irrelevant details. And the paper - TERRIBLE. The papers were graded almost exclusively on a minor formatting detail and content was irrelevant.

Every class, you are graded from 0-3 on your participation, which creates an environment where you feel like you have to say something even if it doesn't add much to the discussion. Assessment was 20% participation, 16% discussion posts, 39% quizzes, and 25% was a 1500-word essay. The quizzes covered material from the textbook that wasn't discussed in class and lecture material from the previous class. They were mostly fair, but there would always be one or two ambiguous multiple-choice questions or fill-in-the-blank questions where she would copy a line from a reading or podcast and remove a word. It was significantly easier to get an 18 or 19 / 20 on each quiz than it was to ace them, so by the end, I was reading the textbook but not actively studying it. A benefit of the quizzes was that they were low-stakes (8 quizzes that are worth 39% of the grade), but it meant you had an assessment every week. She made the seventh one optional. The final paper was to either write a parenting op-ed or design an experiment to test a hypothesis about child development.\"",

Prof. Herman would state main concepts incorrectly fairly often during lecture and then it would be confusing to actually understand what she was saying. She also admitted that her expertise is not in actual child development, and the class was consequentially very centered around the experience of race and SES in adolescents, which is what she studies.

Other than the textbook quizzes, the grading (all credit/no credit) for the class involved 5 1-page writing assignments in response to various readings or ted talks, a 1-2 page final paper on a topic of your choosing, and a group project that culminated in a 10-15 minute Zoom presentation.

            "review 8: \"08S with Janine Scheiner: The structure of the class is pretty straightforward and repetitive: learn about a clinical diagnosis' criteria, causes, vulnerabilities, and treatment, and then move onto the next one. With such a big variety of diagnoses to go over, you're bound to find some more interesting than others. However, how much they're talked about in class is often related to the amount of research done on them. So, don't be surprised if you spend a week talking about depression, but only 10 minutes focusing on histrionic personality disorder. Professor Scheiner is what you'd typically expect from what you've heard of: she is full of energy, is really enthusiastic about what she does, and can contribute personal insight since she also works as a clinical psychologist throughout the week. (She provides the more practical clinical experience, while the other person who teaches the class - Professor Margaret Funnell - provides more research experience.) Scheiner has a great sense of humor, and always has interesting personal anecdotes. That being said, she often goes off on tangents, and talks about her family a bit too much. Due to this lack of time efficiency, don't be surprised if you don't end up covering the last few topics on the syllabus. The work in this class is pretty minimal. Just go to class, and read a few chapters of the textbook (along with a handful of short articles) for the test. The amount of reading required for each of the three non-cumulative tests dramatically decreases. Off the top of my head, the amount of reading for the tests was roughly 200 pages, 100 pages, and 50 pages. With that you can see why it gets progressively easier to prepare for each test. Speaking of tests, they're...interesting. They're strictly multiple-choice, so those with a natural advantage with that format will love this class. For those who don't (such as myself), things get a bit difficult. The tests are not curved, and even after reviewing all the readings, I still find myself having trouble answering a bunch of questions. One particular problem was the often ambiguous wording of test questions. On test day, this often resulted in a constant line of students waiting to ask Professor Scheiner to clarify them. I'd strongly recommend that you ask questions if there is ever any confusion on the tests. One of the most difficult parts of this class aside from the test structure is the fact that it's a 9L. Naturally, if you go to class you get a better understanding of the material and learn things that the textbook doesn't mention, but which Scheiner would nonetheless include on the tests. However, if you're not a morning person, getting up so early three days a week can be quite taxing. By the way, the ORC description isn't exactly accurate. Personality theory is very rarely talked about throughout the class. There were no guest lecturers. There's also no \"special project\" to do. With Professor Scheiner, all you do is take those three non-cumulative 50-question multiple-choice exams. (Funnell requires a paper on top of this.)\"",

It's also starting to get a little out of date, so hopefully the next edition will be editted or the profs will choose a different book. The case studies book, on the other hand, is extremely well-written and interesting. This term the course was actually team-taught by two profs, Candice Monson and Jennifer Price... They were both pretty effective lecturers, and I loved hearing about their clinical experiences... Unfortunately, they didn't seem to care about the course itself, leaving test writing, grading, and review sessions mostly to the TA. The TA, meanwhile, cared even less about the course; she failed to show up to two out of the three review sessions! There were also a few guest lectures. These were generally interesting, but there was often a large overlap between what they taught and material previously covered by the professors.

Tests were written by the TA, and were harder than necessary, but probably were not the only factor in deciding grades.

She did not write the tests herself, or reevalute them. The TA (a grad student) wrote the tests which often contained material more advanced than that in the text. Monson was only available before the class for an hour (class was a 9) so all the people having drill were not able to ever meet with her. Also, if asked about a test or anything of that matter, she would just send you off to the TA's office hours.

The only problem with this course was that the multiple choice on the exam was put together by the graduate TA and some of the questions were unreasonable.

The class as a whole seemed interested, and Professors Price and Monson were very good at interacting while giving lectures (even if our sleepy selves didn't want to!).

My main gripe (if you can call it that) is that Dr. Monson was rarely available outside of class (or so it seemed to me). She works at the VA hospital in Vermont, so she was constantly rushing from class to work and I'm not really even sure when she held office hours.

However, if you are hoping to go into clinical psychology, this approach could have been better suited to your interests. As it was, the course lacked the \"hard science\" underpinings that I have enjoyed in some of my other psych. classes, and was not as compelling as it might otherwise have been.

She genuinely cared about our well-being and wanted to help us succeed in the classroom. She was dedicated and resposive, promptly responding to questions (even on weekends!). The exams fairly assessed our understanding of the course material and included both multiple choice and short answer questions. There was one essay, for which she presented clear guidelines and expectations. Oh, and the final exam was not cumulative! She posted videocasts of classes online, so some people chose not go to class. However, for the most part, people attended and were engaged.

            "review 3: \"08S with Janine Scheiner: The structure of the class is pretty straightforward and repetitive: learn about a clinical diagnosis' criteria, causes, vulnerabilities, and treatment, and then move onto the next one. With such a big variety of diagnoses to go over, you're bound to find some more interesting than others. However, how much they're talked about in class is often related to the amount of research done on them. So, don't be surprised if you spend a week talking about depression, but only 10 minutes focusing on histrionic personality disorder. Professor Scheiner is what you'd typically expect from what you've heard of: she is full of energy, is really enthusiastic about what she does, and can contribute personal insight since she also works as a clinical psychologist throughout the week. (She provides the more practical clinical experience, while the other person who teaches the class - Professor Margaret Funnell - provides more research experience.) Scheiner has a great sense of humor, and always has interesting personal anecdotes. That being said, she often goes off on tangents, and talks about her family a bit too much. Due to this lack of time efficiency, don't be surprised if you don't end up covering the last few topics on the syllabus. The work in this class is pretty minimal. Just go to class, and read a few chapters of the textbook (along with a handful of short articles) for the test. The amount of reading required for each of the three non-cumulative tests dramatically decreases. Off the top of my head, the amount of reading for the tests was roughly 200 pages, 100 pages, and 50 pages. With that you can see why it gets progressively easier to prepare for each test. Speaking of tests, they're...interesting. They're strictly multiple-choice, so those with a natural advantage with that format will love this class. For those who don't (such as myself), things get a bit difficult. The tests are not curved, and even after reviewing all the readings, I still find myself having trouble answering a bunch of questions. One particular problem was the often ambiguous wording of test questions. On test day, this often resulted in a constant line of students waiting to ask Professor Scheiner to clarify them. I'd strongly recommend that you ask questions if there is ever any confusion on the tests. One of the most difficult parts of this class aside from the test structure is the fact that it's a 9L. Naturally, if you go to class you get a better understanding of the material and learn things that the textbook doesn't mention, but which Scheiner would nonetheless include on the tests. However, if you're not a morning person, getting up so early three days a week can be quite taxing. By the way, the ORC description isn't exactly accurate. Personality theory is very rarely talked about throughout the class. There were no guest lecturers. There's also no \"special project\" to do. With Professor Scheiner, all you do is take those three non-cumulative 50-question multiple-choice exams. (Funnell requires a paper on top of this.)\"",
            "review 4: \"08F with Margaret Funnell: I found this course to be really interesting. Of all the Dartmouth courses I've taken so far, I definitely learned the most taking Abnormal Psych. Psych 1 has a lot to do with common sense. Abnormal, and the other psych classes in the 20s, begin getting into the nitty gritty of more specific subject areas and you really start to learn stuff you didn't already know. 4 exams. 3 \"midterms\" and a cumulative final. The third midterm was given at the same time as the final. The exams are part multiple choice, part short answer. Everyone says this about psych courses, but seriously: read the book, go to class, and you'll do well on the tests. 1 paper on the topic of your choice, 5-7 pages. Professor Funnell is really nice and has a very straight-forward teaching style. Sometimes a little boring. She's great during office hours. Go to her for help on your paper, and she'll basically find online journal articles for you. She's also really helpful during the exams.

The class incorporates both the psychological and biological perspectives of disease and looks at diagnosis, symptomatology, and treatment. There is a small amount of neuroscience during the course, such as knowing certain parts of the brain affected in various disorders and the major neurotransmitters. Prof. Funnell is very fair in her assessment of your performance- you get to choose which questions you want to answer on the short and long essay parts of the test. You will also write a short paper on a topic of your choosing. Funnell is pretty knowledgeable about the lecture material, but being a 9-hour class it is still hard to focus completely sometimes.

When he used an X-hour for the first time, he baked cookies for the whole class. I thought he did a pretty good job of highlighting the more important material as it pertained to preparing for exams. Speaking of exams, there were 4 noncumulative multiple-choice exams which made up the bulk of the grade. There were also like 6 5-question reading quizzes throughout the term. That's it, that's what you're graded on. As far as course structure goes, I tended to be a little underwhelmed with what we were learning. The whole class is built around this concept called the \"neruopsychosocial\" model of psychopathology, where there's a focus on the feedback loops between neurological, psychological, and social factors that lead to the development of mental disorders. I agree that as of our current understanding that this model is definitely the best way to understand mental illness, but the nature of the 10-week term and the relative lack of depth of the textbook meant that everything got only lightly brushed. For example, I would have been fascinated to explore the neurology of Schizophrenia in significant more depth. But, instead we briefly covered brain ventricles and synapse-pruning and that was it. I recognize that I'm criticizing this class for being too easy, which is probably not the concern of most people reading this.

The examples are humorous and help grasp the ideas based on real events that happened to real people and how they are used to influence are everyday life. The second book based on research findings was interesting because it showed the science side of psychology and where all the information comes from. This book especially helped me since I was taking Psych 11 this term as well and I gave me a greater appreciation for the work that these authors put into their research.

It was $80 (and I had to pay rush shipping because the first few homework assignments were DUE and I didn't realize you had a free 2-week trial period) and the text is absolutely required so that we can take quizzes and recaps that were 13% of the grade. I didn't find out until the last one that there are answer keys online and that's why I was doing so poorly--the questions are oddly specific and difficult. I'm writing this before the final, but honestly I couldn't call this a layup. I would be surprised if the median is even a B+, since looking the grade ranges an average of 85% on the four (4!!!!) midterms seemed to be about the middle of the pack. Finally, a normal class has about 3-5 components of the final grade. That way the amount of effort sunk into any project is justifiable. This class had 10 different assessments, including: four midterms, a final, a \"scrapbook\", in-class writing, quizzes, homework, and a short assignment. We had a fucking \"short\" assignment worth 2% of the grade! And when I handed mine in I saw that others had submitted literal essays. At first I thought these were \"gimme\" grades, like we'd get 100% if we put in enough effort, but they're legitimately being graded on content. Poor TA for having to grade 120 of these things. Unless you're a psych major, stay away, and even if you are, drop the fucking major. god\""

This class surpassed the hype I had going in, and I still think of the class to this day - Professor Jernstedt was that good, and the material was that applicable. While some professors are incapable of improving their courses (due to ignorance, incapability, stubbornness, etc.), Professor Jernstedt every year significantly fine-tunes his course to provide students with a worthwhile learning experience. All the learning comes from lectures, interactive in-class presentations/questions, practice problem sets that prepare you for tests well, and two self-analytical papers. There is no reading for the course, I feel that I spent less time for this course than others (most of my work was done in the days preceding the tests), and yet I feel I learned so much more than the vast majority of courses I've taken. How's that for an efficient, worthwhile academic experience? One thing that surprised me was how analytical this course is. Doing well in the class relies on being aware of the details and applying the concepts. Professor Jernstedt grades blindly and fairly. The only downfall to the course is his current grading system, which has a grading criteria that awards you for properly addressing a list of points - if you neglect to mention all the points, you can easily get docked. However, adequate preparation for the tests (i.e., doing the extremely helpful practice problem sets) minimizes this from occurring. Learning was definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Dartmouth, and I'd recommend this course to any student of any major. The professor makes this course amazing, and the material is highly applicable throughout your studies. My biggest regret is that I will be unable to take an upper-level course with Professor Jernstedt before I graduate. P.S. If I were able to give him a grade Dartmouth style, I'd totally tag on a citation with that \"A.\"\"",

I cannot honestly think of anything bad to say about Psych 22... it doesn't require that much work outside of class either.

In the second half, he switched formats to a series of multiple choice/one word answers taking you through the case study, with instant feedback as you go. The problem with this is that how you did often depended on how well you were able to get into Jernstedt's head and see how he would interpret a single word in the answer, and not really how well you knew the material.

Christian: Professor Jernstedt is fully committed to ensuring that everyone in the course is familiar with all terminology and concepts, almost to a fault (the class sometimes dragged along when someone would ask for further clarification on a concept that everyone else understood by the second explanation). He is nothing if not accommodating; he had clear office hours set and was always there during the times I had questions. Halfway through the course, the format of the exams changed from an essay-style case study analysis (the mean on this style of case study was fairly low so he decided, in true \"Learning\" style, that it wasn't an appropriate assessment of our knowledge and changed it) to a fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice type. I performed considerably better on the latter type of exam-- none of which were cumulative except in the sense that the knowledge sort of builds on itself-- though I believe that the entire class would have done better if we had the second type of exam throughout the course. That he changed the exam style midstream is a testament to Professor Jernstedt's commitment to grading fairly. He also instituted six different grading computations and indicated that whichever one yielded the best grade for you would be selected as your final grade: 1. Absolute (the points you earned as a percentage of the maximum, which is the standard grading scale in other courses) 2. Relative (the one which yields the best grade for a number of people, but also fosters competition and some implicit sabotage because this scale gives you a percentage score-- a la the SATs-- about your performance relative to the other members of the class; this one was problematic for the rather large group of people whose marks were clustered near the mean, since performing slightly better than the mean resulted in a huge jump in your relative status) 3. Scale (the course was divided into two sections-- Conditioning and Cognitive-- and there were two exams in each; the first exam was worth 22% of your grade and the second one was worth 28% of your grade, because it is assumed that your grade will be better on the second exam once you know how it works) A. Equal (each exam is worth 25% of your grade) B. Improvement (each exam is worth progressively more than the last, so if your performance improves over time, your grade really reflects this) The six combinations of 1-3 and A&B above produced your various grades. As I wrote above, the relative scale was probably the most pleasant scale for people in the class because it had less to do with your actual point score and more to do with how much better or worse you did on an exam than a certain proportion of the class. It was also potentially the most frustrating because if you had an off day, your relative percentage could drop, making the relative scale no longer your best chance at getting a good mark. The absolute scale didn't serve anyone well (except if Professor Jernstedt did a lot of curving) because few people consistently performed well enough to earn an A or an A- in that manner.\"",

Every class meeting was interesting and enlightening, and the professor was always very open and enthusiastic. My only real complaint is that the TAs do not really make themselves available to the students, except twice in the term when the class has to write self-analysis papers.

Very different in its style, the course has no text-book and is based on skill-development, not memorization of facts. Not having reading/problem set assignments will make you want to slack off, but do some reviewing - it'll help. When an assignment deadline gets near though, you will definitely be studying hard.

Jernstedt inspired a lot of interest in the subject, bringing in animal and human subjects to teach us about the principles of learning.

However, while the prof prides himself on having created this class so we learn the best way possible (based on scientific evidence) and I really do believe I learned a lot in this class, the grading (at least for me) is extremely harsh...The \"Academic Interns\" (TAs) graded our tests (called \"briefs\"...which were essentially real life situations which we had to apply as many of the learning principles as we could to in about 20 min...3 in an hour) and our papers (called \"Self-analyses\"..where we took a situation we'd learned in and analyzed it with the principles) and I feel like even when I studied harder after the first round of briefs, I didn't really improve very much and I think they all expected a bit too much out of us. We were often expected to talk about ALL of the possibilities in each brief, which is nearly impossible in 20 min, and as a result, I was somewhat discouraged by the grade I was getting...I really loved the course and wanted to do well, somehow I don't think that even if I had devoted all of my free time to this course I would have done THAT much better...But I did love this course, don't get me wrong, and maybe other people disagree with me about the way it was graded.

Also, I was disappointed with the simplistic, introductory nature of the class (though my non-major friends did not feel that way about the material or approach). Jernstadt is a great professor who has obviously put a lot of passion and time into designing this course; it just didn't work for me.

There is no \"blind\" or double blind system so that if the TAs have friends in the class, I'd bet they're more biased towards giving their friends better scores (unconsciously or consciously).

There are also 2 self-analysis papers, which also dont take too long. While these assessments were dont that difficult, as in, if you have problem solving skills, you can do them, the TA's thought that grading harshly would somehow be a great idea. The grading seemed arbitrary at times and just relied on using certain buzzwords even if you had the analysis correct. The grading ruined a very valueable course.

His goals for his students are inspiring and are a perfect example of how all professors should treat their classes.

It is run from a website that is mildly annoying but gets the job done. Tests are given in the form of 3 short answer question per test. 4 tests a term (final was just a regular test). many people didn't do well on the test because they didn't use the special buzzwords or terms we learned in class and instead implied them or used descriptions. If you used the silly terms for everything we learned, you did well. The TAs were very picky in the grading but if you used the terms, you did well. There are also 2 4-5 pages papers that are about a learning situation. These papers are pretty easy because again, you make up a story to use the terms. I know students who got into trouble trying to use a true situation because it didn't fit exactly and they couldn't explain it perfectly with the terms, so they got points off. The key was to take a fictionalized version of something in your life and then make the rest up to fit the learning principles. That way you can tailor the paper to exactly what they are looking for. It was very risky to deviate from this plan. Still, if you follow this advice, the class wasn't that hard, it's just not a typical psych class. i usually get As in psych classes and i'm going to get a B+ in the class because i didn't catch on to the regurgitate the terms concept until halfway through.\"",

Most people who take this class will tell you that Professor Jernstedt is the class' best aspect. And I could not agree more. Jernstedt is terrific, and has a knack for giving clear, engaging, and interesting lectures. He really is just that great. One thing that surprised me was how light the workload was compared to other classes. Since this was my first term here, the high number of the class (22) intimidated me somewhat. But it shouldn't. Out of the three classes I took, this class probably required the least work outside of regular class hours. There's absolutely no homework in this class, and there's no textboook either. This class isn't a breeze, mind you. Rather, it's just that everything you need to learn comes straight from the lectures. (This isn't a problem because it's Jernstedt giving them.) Of course, this makes it imperative that you attend the lectures, but there's no real reason why you'd want to miss them anyway. The amount of material you learn is actually not that much... the main thing is knowing how to apply it. Your grade is based on your performance on four briefs and two self-analyses. On the briefs, you're basically given four scenarios and given an hour to write an analysis for three of them before having to blitz them back to the TAs. Admittedly, the briefs can get a tad vague on occasion, but everyone's on the same boat in that regard. The self-analyses are also a bit vague, but more than manageable. My advice though: WRITE A DRAFT! It will give you a much better idea on what exactly they want from you. Jernstedt had this bizarre grading system where he gave you four separate grades based on different aspects of your work, and then gave you the highest out of the four. Still, don't expect the four grades to differ much... you really can't afford to slack off. (And really, it's kind of hard to \"slack off\" in a course where there's not even any homework or reading assigned in the first place.) As a freshman, I was worried about taking this course without taking Psych 1 first.

In other flipped classrooms I\u2019ve experienced at Dartmouth, the class time was filled with good activities and problem sets to reinforce the online learning. Not in this class. Class time was filled with Dwiel ranting about the quizzes (more on that below), complete time-waster assignments, and \u201cgroup work time\u201d for group projects that are honestly easier to complete separately on everyone\u2019s own time.

There\u2019s no nicer way to say it, and I feel bad because Dwiel is one of those young profs with a ton of kindness, people skills, and promise. I could see him being everyone\u2019s favorite prof in a few years. I honestly really liked him as a dude. But he\u2019s very new to teaching, and it shows. He put a huge emphasis on student feedback, especially regarding quizzes, but this led to him changing our quiz structure like 4 times throughout the term. He would waste time in class by opening up intensely minor contention points from the exams into these bizarre socratic dialogues. Sir \u2014 I do not come to class to have 30 minute conversations about whether to allow 2 or 3 make up points from quiz corrections. He clearly wants to give his students a voice in terms of course evaluation, but at a certain point he has to learn to man up and let his students cope about their quiz grades. People will always be mad when they get bad grades, and endlessly talking about that won\u2019t change it. 3. Pointless assignments. College profs across the board need to knock it off with these banal Canvas discussion post type assignments. They teach us nothing and waste our time. Nearly every assignment in this class can be considered 20 minutes of busy work, and nothing more. I fail to see how \u201cteach a skill day\u201d taught us a single thing about the course material. And my weekly reflection posts on Canvas were a weekly demonstration of how I can best write 150 words of complete nonsense. 4. The quiz questions just sucked. I didn\u2019t even do too badly on the quizzes generally speaking, but the questions were hard. I always had to guess at what Dwiel was getting at, and the \u201cchoose all that apply\u201d questions were particularly maddening. 5. In summary, this was supposed to be my layup class, but ended up being by far my most frustrating for those reasons. Not to mention that nearly ALL of the course content was related to small animal learning (mice, pigeons, sea snails, etc.), with brazenly large logical leaps to humans. It all just feels so silly that I took this class. I\u2019d advise that you take a different class if you have the option.\"",

Flipped class, so you watch all the lectures for the quiz outside of class and honestly I don't even know what we need to go to class for. He takes attendance by making students do in-class assignments, and this was a 9L so that sucked. So many small assignments to keep track of and you need to do all of them because of the grading system -- but there is no hard deadline, you just have to finish them before the last day of class. To be honest some of the activities/assignments do not really serve a purpose and to me it was all busy work, but you can get them done fairly quickly because it's all completion. Prof Dwiel is too nice to a fault. He loves asking for feedback on quizzes, etc, and that is amazing until it's halfway through the term and he is still changing class components/how we are supposed to take the quizzes. Changed them from canvas with 1 retake with the same question bank to canvas with 1 retake with completely different questions to canvas with corrections instead of retakes to paper quizzes with corrections lol. Most people hated this, or at least the ones I've talked to.The experiment proposal is easy to do. Quizzes are hard and kind of remind me of Psyc 1 -- if you really understand what is going on you will do fine but questions are phrased weirdly sometimes and they can be nuanced. I have a love-hate relationship with this class because I think Prof. Dwiel is an amazing human being, super nice and accommodating, just a very disorganized teacher, which makes sense because this is only his second term teaching. He takes feedback very seriously tho, and hopefully in future terms will be able to have a class that students have better experiences in.\"",

It's possible the content is far more engaging in person. Also, for some reason, I was expecting this class to be about the psychology of human education, in a similar vein to Cognition with Dr. Brown. No. This class is ENTIRELY about conditioning, stuff like Pavlov's dog, etc. Basically the different (conflicting) models of learning we've built from training rats, pigeons, and dogs with food and electric shocks. Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, etc. As a neurobio person, the whole class was far too model-based for me. There was little mention of biological/neurological phenomena that might underlie the conditioning behaviors. You just have to memorize a bunch of theories of how animals learn/are trained, with little basis in biological data.\"",

Word of caution, though; it is very easy to forget about the quizzes, which are online. He never reminds us about them in class, and if you are late at all, you get a 0.

I also like how the exams were structured - each was one third of your grade and they were not cumulative.

He also has study guides for the exams which are REALLY helpful! Study with these and you'll do well. Downsides: he'll try to scare you away in the beginning because he teaches the material very intensively and doesn't believe in making things easy for students (I think several people dropped out after the first midterm) ; also, he's not very helpful if you're floundering. He tries if you make the effort to go to office hours but he's just too knowledgeable about the topic, I think, to understand what it feels like to be struggling with the basics.

He is very unaware. \"okay,\" you're thinking, \"so what--he is ignorant like many others, what's the big deal?\" The big deal is he thinks he's woke and makes a point of it, and it's difficult to watch. He \"championed\" mental health and having a support system/ being good to ourselves & others/ treated better by the institution, but also made up for our Mental Health Day by having an X-hour the following week (were those 40 minutes worth of learning really that important if you're apparently so into students' mental health?). He acted as our hero by letting us have 4 hours instead of 3 for the final if we wanted, but it's the kind of thing where you know in reality he's just happy that he wrote an exam that's difficult or long enough to warrant needing to go over the allotted time period.

Exams are kind of unfair. Tse talks a big talk about \"understanding root concepts\" and \"applying knowledge practically,\" but that's not the case: Having taken this class in various forms about 4 different times, I should by now how be able to \"apply\" knowledge, but the exams are hit or miss depending on what key phrases/definitions you gleaned from the powerpoint slides/book.

Prof. Tse is a (charmingly awkward at times) professor who has a distinctly inquisitive lecturing style as he discusses how we end up perceiving stimuli. Of the senses we discuss in class, he favors vision, and it shows in terms of how much time he devotes to it in terms of the course and in terms of the cumulative final. He also presents this sense in the most interesting manner. We had three tests - two midterms, and a cumulative final. The tests do not require reading the textbook - the book works best when you need to clarify something discussed in class. Professor Tse is a Dartmouth alum who understands the plight of undergrads here, and implemented the ultimate incentive to make students study harder for each successive test: every time you received a higher score on a test, that score replaces every lower score for previous tests. For instance, if your test scores were in order 80, 90, and 85, the 90 would replace the previous lower score so your test scores would instead of 90, 90, and 85.

Hull has a great approach with them as well. There are a total of 20 homeworks. Most of them have 20 questions. If you pass with a 70 or above, you automatically get a 100 on the homework. So basically, if you pass all of the homeworks, you get a free 100 factored into your grade. Def a great grade booster. Hull is really fair about it too. He gives you two freebees, so basically you can fail two and still get a 100 for your homework grade. He also offers supplemental homeworks if a lot of the class fails a certain homework. The exams were definitely fair. But don't think you can just do the homeworks with an open book and the powerpoint lecture right in front of you, and then do well on the exam.

He's almost always available for 1-1 office hours and hosts weekly group sessions for people who need a little bit of extra help or practice. Class sessions directly reinforce material covered in the the homework and textbook, so if you don't understand it from one source it's likely you'll understand it from the other. The way he structures his class is pretty unique too: all students are divided up into working groups of around 6 people. Class starts with lecture from the professor and then groups break into collaborative work using pre-prepared packets with problems that reinforce the material covered in the class.

The material for the first exam seemed stupidly easy and I felt a little blindsided by how difficult it was considering how simple the questions in class had been. I cannot stress enough how much he focuses on the conceptual aspects of statistics. You barely need to understand the math aspect but drill the conceptual parts. The textbook was the most helpful for me when studying. He also made a ton of grading mistakes and I had to go to him at least three times to make corrections. Without those corrections I would have ended up with a grade two letters lower than I got so it was really necessary and not good that he made that many mistakes. The Learning Fellows really saved me in this class and explained things much more clearly than he did. I appreciated how many opportunities he gave us to correct mistakes and do better and he did make himself incredibly available.

The x-hour was typically optional and used to continue to work on problems. In addition, you'd have a short HW assignment due for each class - they're just graded on completion and if you finish all of them you get 2 bonus points on the final. After classes, he would have a 5 question canvas knowledge check - these are quizzes that you can retake as much as you want and would ask more conceptual questions on the problems you worked on. Pfister doesn't use any coding in this class and wants you to understand why certain statistical procedures are used. Pfister would start each class with a short lecture, which was sometimes confusing, but he held a TON of office hours, which personally I found way more helpful than the actual lecture.

Consequently, we all turned to the textbook, which is pretty easy to understand. The course itself is 'conceptual,' and really doesn't require any mathematical prowess, though I assure you it will be easier for you if you've been exposed to it a little bit before. There are two tests and a midterm, as well as homeworks (2-3 textbook problems) about twice, sometimes thrice, a week.

Even when I didn't answer in the exact way the professor was looking for, I received close to full credit for my explanation.

Professor Lorig's lectures could often be condensed to five minutes. As a matter of fact, a five-minute lecture followed by a tiny problem sets would've been the ideal balance. Yet balance was not present. Professor Lorig ineptly added fluff to attempt to make his lectures amusing and meaningful. He explained points poorly, and never referenced the book, which the majority of the class stopped reading after the first test. He did encourage us to get to know Excel better, and did introduce us to SPSS, which I believe is more widely used than rival program STATA. Yet time was wasted, and people were barely taught. Thank goodness for the TA. He was the anti-Lorig. He lacked charisma, but taught concisely and clearly. Fluff was kept to a minimum. There were no graded assignments other than the tests. Since the reading was irrelevant, and the two mini-assignments (I won't even give them the dignity of the label \"homework\" or \"problem sets\") only took a minute, many students had trouble grasping the more math-heavy material. Professor Lorig could have provided problem sets. Three questions per topic, followed by a detailed explanation - that would've been perfect. He chose not to do this. There were three tests: they were all open-book, and they were all given various time-limits. I really liked how they were administered on Blackboard, allowing us for example a two-day range to take a two-hour test. We could thus manage our schedules better to accommodate a stressful test. The questions were thought-out, and fairly straightforward, but they also required understanding, something Professor Lorig often didn't give. We had to appropriately provide paragraphs, graphs, charts, etc. to do well. The test scores also improved dramatically when Professor Lorig provided the class a bunch of example questions, complete with detailed explanations. He must have gotten lazy or afraid too many people were doing well, because he gradually phased them out. When requests were made for more example questions, he did not seem to pleased to go through the extra work. A bonus was that the course, which was an easy B+/A- to begin with, offered manageable extra credit, that after devoting perhaps two hours of your time, could result in a bump in your grade by a third of a letter (like from an A- to an A). It's a pity that so many students who took this class had to due to their social-science majors, with Psych majors explicitly having to take Psych 10. I feel that I did not learn much in terms of statistics, and what little I did learn is quickly fading. Thank goodness Tyler Lorig is only a visiting profesor. When he leaves, though, if you really want to understand your stats class instead of going through it with a weak grasp, go with Hull. He's more efficient, a better lecturer, and better at helping students reach their full potential. While it is true that Hull would actually assign homework, it'd be worth the effort.\"",

Yet, amazingly, both the students and the class lived up to her low expectations. Frankly, this was the WHINIEST class I've ever taken at Dartmouth. Normally, if a prof writes a test that is too long or too hard for students, the students hand it in, deal with it, and wait to see how it gets curved. Not in this class, though.

Granted, this was Professor Thornton's first term teaching, so it's understandable if concepts weren't explained very clearly or effectively.

            "review 1: \"23W with John Pfister: LOVED THIS CLASS!! Probably my favorite and most laidback class I've taken at Dartmouth to date. Not much work besides quick readings and some videos before each class. Second half of the term was mostly student seminars where you got to choose your own topic, which was actually a lot of fun. Professor Pfister is so sweet, he'd bring us hot tea and coffee and homemade pastries every Friday morning, which make the 9L a lot more pleasant. He made the classroom feel like a safe space and even the super shy people were consistently raising their hand towards the end of the term. He is super encouraging when giving feedback for essays and I only have good things to say about this class. Grading wise, he's very fair. However, you should put some effort into the pre-class assignments because losing points on those adds up. Every essay was super fun and I had a great time discussing some topics outside of class with him. If you can, I highly recommend taking this class with him!!\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with John Pfister: AMAZING PROF. Easy easy class. Barley any work- take this seminar if possible. Prof Pfister care about every student and really boosts your confidence. Every essay is pretty much pick your topic. Prof cares about students mental health and works around student conflicts. Fun, low key material like aliens and astrology. Just a good time all around. He has tea and snacks (often home made baked goods) every Friday so if you have to take him as 9L like I did, it's so worth it.\"",
            "review 3: \"20W with John Pfister: Prof Pfister is my favorite prof at Dartmouth to date. He's an eccentric character and super nice. Science and Pseudoscience was a HUGE layup. Not only that, it was an incredibly interesting course. Readings were quick and easy- and very fun and interesting. I'd HIGHLY recommend trying to take this course with prof Pfister if you can.\"",
            "review 4: \"09S with John Pfister: Let me start this thing off by saying that Professor Pfister is a wonderful professor and a wonderful person. Classes are very laid back, he's more than approachable, and it's evident that he is concerned with providing his students with an enriching educational experience. While I found the lecture materials to be absolutely fascinating, I'll tell you that they're not for everybody. Readings and discussions are about all things...well, weird, to be quite frank. Topics range from UFOs to Bigfoot to assisted communication to the paranormal to global warming. Professor Pfister is very knowledgeable about all of his class materials, he's very sensitive to respecting his students' beliefs/opinions, he presents both sides of each argument, and he leaves the direction of the course up to the class for the most part. As far as the workload is concerned, it's a 2-3 page essay every week. Very manageable. While this may not be as \"hard\" or \"challenging\" as writing a few 8-10 pagers, I found it to be more helpful. If you're going to become a better writer, you need practice. You get that with this class. What's more, Professor Pfister provides very punctual feedback on each essay. Also, if you turn in your essays by a certain time, you have the option of editing them and re-submitting them. Oh, and you are only required to do 7 or so essays so if you knock them out right away, you can spend the last couple of weeks preparing for your other two finals. This seminar comes highly recommended.\"",
            "review 5: \"08S with John Pfister: it was interesting at first, but then the lectures / discussions became repetitive and thus a bit boring. I feel like we've been talking about the the same things over the whole term. That being siad, the topics are interesting, we went through alien abductions, astrology, fengshui, twin telepathy, etc.. we usually learn it through watching youtube videos, and then we will discuss if we believe in it or not. it's a really interesting class but not that intellectually stimulating, i can almost conclude everything that ive learned in one sentence: do not believe in anything that is unproven. the prof is really friendly and approachable, and he talks A LOT. take it if you are looking for an easy class. we have to write 6 papers (2-3 pages each) and our \"research\" is done through a 1 hour presentation-- perfect seminar if you dread research papers.\"",
            "review 6: \"07S with John Pfister: There were a lot of papers but they were short and pretty simple. The large research paper was pretty easy as well. The class disucssions were fun and enlightening. The individual presentations were probably my favorite part of the class. My only reecommendation is that when you are considering this class for your seminar, keep in mind that it is a class on SKEPTICISM. It talks about the paranormal but if you are hardcore into the supernatural be prepared to look mostly into how the scientific method and the paranormal do not work together.\"",
            "review 7: \"06S with John Pfister: Credulity is a pretty narrow subject to have a course in, and there aren't a huge number of interesting things about it. So Pfister ends up getting too excited about material which isn't that groundbreaking. It's great to be passionate about what you teach, but his discussions are way too general. Analyzing why people believe in aliens or psychics or other myths every day can get pretty repetitive. There were a few demonstrations and explorations of myths that were moderately entertaining. The first day was a riot. But too bad class participation was part of the grade - I could think of better ways to spend my 2A time block. The second half of the course, student presentations (second half of the course) were again moderately entertaining. Pfister also had a tendency to comandeer the discussion during someone's presentation. Pfister's always able to work with you on papers and such. However, this is seriously a waste of time if you get around a B+ on most of your papers. Whether you put a lot of effort or a little bit of effort, unless you write with a style Pfister absolutely loves, the best you can do is an A-, which he'll assign you anyway at the end of term (it is the median grade). Don't think tons of extra effort or excellent content in your papers will get you an A. Pfister judges you almost entirely on style. I got A's and A-'s on all of the assignments, and I was under the impression the average grade was something like a B+ - hence, I was very surprised when I recieved the median grade, an A-. I also put a ton of effort into the course, trying to research original content for all of my papers. I could have BS'd my way through the course so much more easily. However, I did learn something from the papers as opposed to the class discussions because I did this work. Don't get me wrong - Pfister is a great guy. I just come from a different background and disagree with some of his philosophies on teaching and grading. That being said, this IS the seminar to take. It's easy, you can BS most of your papers - like I said, don't put much effort into them - it won't matter if you do them in half an hour or eight.\"",
            "review 8: \"06S with John Pfister: Definitely an interesting class. Talked about telepathy, pet psychics, hypnosis, demonic posession, and other weird stuff. We had papers due every Thurs. (approx. 1-3 pags on avg; usually 1-2) and they can be rewritten as long as they are handed in beforehand for review. Every1 had to do an hr long presentation on a topic of their choice-not that bad-most ppl showed some sort of video for half their presentation. Not difficult as long as u talk to the prof if ur having any trouble-a really nice guy-willing to work with u.\"",
            "review 9: \"06S with John Pfister: Professor Pfister is great. He is really passionate about the subject and makes himself extremely available outside of class. It is easy to do well because he is always willing to work with students and review/talk about assignments. In-class discussions are a breeze because the material is so interesting that essentially everyone has something to contribute. I strongly suggest choosing this one as your freshman seminar.\"",
            "review 10: \"06S with John Pfister: This is the seminar you want to take. Prof Pfister can be weird but he is great prof and a great guy. His office hours are great and he wants you to do good so you can rewrite papers. If your smart you will take this class.\"",
            "review 11: \"05S with John Pfister: Interesting discussions and plenty of media to discuss. Second half of the course is dedicated to student projects and presentations. These presentations are really fun to take part of. Also Professor Pfister brings snacks for every class.\"",
            "review 12: \"05S with John Pfister: This is a really really (really, really, really) fun class to take... we had some great in-class discussions. However, Pfister taught things like what double-blind experiments are, what \"statistical significance\" means, and basic logical fallacies like ad hom and strawman arguments. If you've honestly never heard these terms before, maybe you'll get something out of the class. However, if you're comfortable ideas like this from high school and you're looking for something intellectually stimulating, look elsewhere.\"",
            "review 13: \"05S with John Pfister: this is the freshman english seminar to take. interesting material and inspiring prof. can't think of anything negative to say about it\"",
            "review 14: \"04S with John Pfister: This class was awesome. For the first 5 weeks we had a simple formula for every lecture: 1 hour of watching a film + 1 hr of disucssion, with a break in between. It gets better. The material was limited to the supernatural (we basically talked about magic, ESP, UFOs, crop circles, etc. everyday), with the academic premise of 'How do we know what to accept as 'true'?' The last 5 weeks are just presentations for the final project. So, after you give your presentation, you can just still back and chill out, enjoying everyone else's work. It's definitely a stress-free environment. Prof. Pfister is awesome. He is truly in love with the material (the 'fun' side of psychology), and brings that excitement to the class. He did 'magic' for us on more than one occasion, and used his authority as the East Wheelock Dean to get us snacks. He's a great guy. So yeah, if you're looking for a 1st-year-seminar to take and have this as an option, TAKE IT. I can't see how you could get a better course than this.\""

            "review 1: \"03F with Ann Clark: The description made this class sound great; the description must have been about a different class. We did a few things: - read books (mostly modern gas station trash) - read neuroscience textbooks - watch movies - have the same discussion every other day - and right horrific research papers These things could be integrated into something of an interesting class covering the material outlined in the description. Instead they were left to stand alone in seemingly unrelated bits. The class was a tremendous disappointment. Although it was not bad (I didn\u2019t have to do much work and got a good grade) it had the potential to be excellent and made nothing of that potential. Although I wrote lots of pages I improved none as a writer. As for Prof Clark \u2013 well good luck. I\u2019m still not sure what her deal is. I have two theories: she has some sort of emotional disorder her self or she picks favorites and black sheep on the first day of class and then forgets which you are from day to day. Regardless be prepared for inexplicably mixed treatment.\"",

            "review 3: \"03F with Ann Clark: This course definitely had interesting material, but the format helped to decrease that interest. This was a 10A, so we would often watch a movie on tuesday, and then discuss the movie, readings, and books (you are supposed to read a novel every week, not completely necessary) for 2 hours on thurs. work consisted of 4 papers (3 research papers, the final one 12-15 pages), readings, novels each week, question sets, and a team presentation (the latter 2 both help your participation grade if you don't like to speak that much in class). for the papers, you hand in a rough draft and a final draft, with the final grade being an average of the two. *one thing i would say is that the people who had previous exposure to mental illness through personal experience definitely had an advantage. also, the papers tend to focus on the biological and scientific aspects of mental illness, and are not literary/social analysis papers, like you might expect. helpful in learning how to do research. the discussions were often tedious but some of the movies/topics were very interesting.\"",
            "review 4: \"03F with Ann Clark: This is a great course. The movies and books are pretty interesting. The only problem is the research papers that you must learn to write. If you take this course you will have to write 3 psyc research papers of lengths 7pages,6pages and 15pages. This was no where in the Description so I thought I'd mention it here. If you dont mind the papers its a great course to take/\"",
            "review 5: \"03F with Ann Clark: While this is a Freshman Seminar class for students who par out of English 5, this is not an English course. The readings are not \"higher literature\", but they are entertaining and helpful in learning about different psychological disorders. The majority of papers are research-based, which was unexpected but helpful in learning about the library system. Also, three of the four papers could be rewritten, so there was always room to improve your grade. Professor Clark was understanding about freshman inexperience and enthusiastic during discussions.\"",

            "review 7: \"03F with Ann Clark: Like everyone else said, the main thrust of this class is scientific research, and not traditional English papers. The research papers take a lot of time, and can be graded harshly on the first draft. Prof. Clark is very personable in class, and I really enjoyed the class discussions and movies.\"",
            "review 8: \"03F with Ann Clark: I expected this course to be a comparison between the media's interpretation of mental illness and the reality. However, this course was almost entirely about the the illnesses themselves! It was not a literary analysis like I expected, but rather a psychological research course which was exceedingly boring. The professor did not lead meaningful discussions. The discussions consisted of students asking inane questions and then the professor answering them because the professor did not seem to have a purpose for each class. The papers were research papers concerning specific mental illnesses. Aside from the first paper, which was on personal experiences with mental illness, they were all research papers. The final paper, a 12-15 page research paper was especially brutal. This class did not help me with my writing, which I believe is what a freshman seminar is for. The only thing I guess I learned is how to do a psychological research paper which, since I'm a non-major, is totally useless to me. Do not take this class\"",

            "review 1: \"02W with William N.: The course itself was interesting. I have to admit that I learned a lot about depression and mood disorders. The materials that we had to read were often dry and hard to understand -- since they were very technical and scientific based. The professor is another story. I strongly disliked the guy due to his condescending attitude towards his students. Often times, he would ramble on and on about his personal stories, which were quite boring. There wasn't a whole lot of discussion in the class because it was him who did most of the talking. He is very anal with the papers that we write. Often times, most students will receive the same grade over and over -- and it gets pretty frustrating. He believes that everyone should visit the composition center. His ego of him thinking that he is the best psychologist at the moment serves his arrogant personality. This seminar seemed to be the most interesting for me, that's why I took it, despite the negative things I've heard about the professor. I heard that next Fall is his last time teaching this course before he retires.\"",

I really wanted to learn about this topic so I was very disappointed. (However it easily knocked out one of my sci distribs so that was very nice) Prof Granger is the most scatter-brained socially awkward guy I've ever met. He is simply not fit for teaching a class in my opinion. I can't even begin to explain. I know it's Fox News but if you're considering taking this class you should know he's nervous all the time and this might explain why: https://www.foxnews.com/story/dartmouth-professors-wife-charged-with-embezzling-from-church)! Fun stuff! He's one of those geniuses that can't articulate anything so you can tell he's very smart but can't learn much from him. We had a textbook but pls God don't buy it. Each student picks a chapter to present to the class and I promise you that's the only chapter you'll need to read. there are no tests so the info isn't something you have to read or even pay much attention to. You have to write maybe 4 (?) short-is papers that pretty much make up your entire grade (in addition to the grade from the in class presentation on your chapter but he never took notes on how we were doing/gave feedback or anything so who knows how he came up with a grade- complete joke). The papers can be on really anything that you want but you must conform to the style that he likes to read which is sort of like a discovery science article that starts with a catchy phrase and includes almost no scientific jargon. It was cool to have that much freedom but he definitely wants you to take each very seriously so you get very good at writing specifically catered to what he likes.\""

At the time I wanted to be a neuroscience major so clearly I was very interested in the subject material. All the tests are multiple choice (as is unfortunately the case with almost all large lecture psych classes) and I am just not a multiple choice test-taker even though hypothetically this type of test should be easier! I guess the fact that the information is all crammed in there is more a fault of the quarter schedule than the course itself which is something I as a freshman had not gotten used to yet. The course material is incredibly interesting. Professor Cohen likes what he is teaching. You can tell he is very interested in it himself, but his lectures are not very exciting to listen to. The part where I learned the least was when the TA lectured. I know that TAs are learning how to lecture, but it was unfortunately placed in the last week and a half of class when all the material was 'coming together' in some fashion and I just got totally thrown off course by the TA's lack of lecturing skills while trying to mentally wrap up the course.\"",

The Quizzes? There were tricky questions on each one, and they often included detailed material only covered the day before. Take good notes and devote a couple hours to reviewing them, (if you can find the time, read the appropriate chapters), and you should be fine.

Except for those classes taught by Cohen. Cohen is a very condescending professor. He fails to understand that we are just students trying to grasp the concepts of the course, and therefore needs to teach us and not look down on us. His lecture slides were very helpful but had some mistakes in grammar that may have made the material unclear at points. Cohen's lecturing skills however were very poor. He often made mistakes in explaining the material and has a very annoying (diet Coke induced), high energy way of talking. The quizes were surprisingly difficult. I am a science buff and having taken the other neuroscience requirements, already knew most of the material coming in. However, the quizes were testing minor details that took away from the important aspects of neuroscience as a whole. Also, some questions were poorly worded. The professor was not helpful towards questions during the quiz so don't waste your time there. On the other hand, the quizes were only about 30 minutes long or shorter. Despite Cohen, however, I enjoyed this course because I am fascinated in the subject. If you like neuroscience as well, don't let this horrible professor discourage you. Do's and Don'ts.

I can see someone interested in perhaps majoring or minoring in neuroscience being turned off from taking this class. If you have to take this class for whatever reason, my advice is to not buy the book, because I used it about 2 times throughout the whole course.

That is NOT the case. Professor Cohen somehow manages to reduce 150 power point slides into 20 multiple choice questions. That's right, no partial credit, nothing, just pick a letter, and if you guess wrong, boom, there goes 5% of your grade. While most of the questions are fair, there are a few bad ones in each test, and this is enough to mess you up. While he does test mainly from his powerpoint slides, he gets a lot of his test questions from the book, and on a couple tests, we had questions about terms that he had never covered in class, but I found out later were in the book. Also, there are some questions that are just poorly worded. If you love neuroscience and plan on majoring/minoring, by all means take this course. The material was, for the most part, quite enjoyable and interesting. However, if you are just look for a science class that sounds fun, in order to fulfill your distribs, seriously consider another class. While you won't do well on the quizzes if you don't study, studying hard won't necessarily get you the grade you want. Also, while he claims that the class requires no previous knowledge, the kids who have taken bio 19, or are taking bio 15, have a serious advantage, because a good chunk of the most detailed molecular portions of the class are covered in bio 15 (as i learned from a friend taking both classes concurrently).\"",

The idea and the concept of the course was excellent; however, the execution of the course was downright horrible. Cohen is a horrible lecturer, both banal and disorganized. His lack of ability to effectively communicate makes lectures not worth attending (which I quickly found out after week 2). Moreover, he is contemptuous and disdainful towards students who ask questions, often giving the attitude of \"Wow, that kid is really stupid,\" or worse. Frankly, Cohen doesn't care about the students at all. The course material could be interesting; however, it is difficult to understand if one has not taken biology or physics, especially since Cohen places a high emphasis beyond that which is necessary on the latter (he was an electrical engineer). Bottom line: Don't take this course. If you want to be a psych major, take psych 1. If you want to take neuroscience, take it through the bio department. As long as Cohen is teaching it, don't take it.\"",

The quizes and grading do NOT test the pertinent class materials that showed you learned the class material. They mainly consist of trivial details that probably make this prof giggle when he writes them (those really annoying multiple choice tests.) Furthermore, when confronted about why the quizes are so trivial, this prof makes sure that you know why you were wrong-- he makes no effort to help you out. Going to his office hours was like entering a criminal court room and asking him questions during the quizes reminded me of the spanish inquisition. I might not be a pre-med or bio major, but in my four years at Dartmouth this will be the worst class I have ever taken.

Doing the readings is essential -- the information is presented in a much more organized way. I recommend doing them BEFORE the class in which they're discussed so that you don't get completely lost. Quizzing was a little weird -- often there was no time to review the material, because it had been taught the day before. Cohen is remarkably unhelpful outside of class; if he feels he's already answered a question that you ask him, he will refuse to reiterate the answer, and instead will tell you: \"I already sent a blitz out about that,\" etc. Which seems petty to me, but I digress.

Later in the course, when it starts to focus more on perception, memory, and learning, the lectures are more stimulating and engaging. And Cohen is better at explaining the material as well.

Professor Cohen is a good prof, very willing to answer questions in and out of class, & his explanations and powerpoint presentations are generally clear, that is if you can stay awake for the powerpoints. It's really very difficult to stay awake, not because the presentations are boring, but because the class is 2 hours long, in a dark, warm lecture hall, @ 10 in the morning. And there's no student participation, really, beyond taking notes, which makes it a lot harder to stay awake. (I guess that's normal for a science lecture course, but I much prefer classes where your presence actually makes a difference.)Going to class & staying awake for lectures does make a difference, though. Even though you do get powerpoint slides to memorize afterwards, it really helps to be there & hear his explanations. The most annoying thing about the class is that your entire grade depends on quizzes, given every week during the x hour from 3 to 4 on Wednesdays. There are usually somewhere between 20 & 25 questions on the quizzes, so missing a few really lowers your grade. & the quizzes really do not fairly evaluate whether or not you know the material. He claims the questions are clear and only one answer makes any sense, but that's not true at all - they're confusingly written, & often more than one answer makes sense, & he doesn't allow you to argue answers. Really, they're as much about understanding what he means by the question as they are about knowing the info. (If you don't know the stuff, you'll do badly, but you won't necessarily do well if you do know it.) This class rewards surface memorization more than actual comprehension or curiosity about the stuff you're learning. We learn that an ATP replaces an ADP without being told that that just means adding a phosphate group, because stuff like that is too \"in depth\" for the class. A couple tips for the class: DO NOT read the textbook - it doesn't help at all & the info is never tested. Just memorize the slides really really well & don't overthink the questions (easy to do, 'cause they're not always really explicitly written.) & get T-points, extra credit points from participation in psych experiments.

It looked like it would be interesting, challenging and fun, and I thought it would be a new experience--different from high school classes. But I was very sorely dissapointed by this class. I would not take this class again, and I would not recommend it to anyone else, not because the course material is bad but because the professor is. The class had no variety. Every period, the professor simply read off a power point slide lecture from a projector overhead. He kept the lights at the perfect dimness to induce sleepiness, and the boring approach he had to teacher fostered, along with the dark atmosphere, the perfect conditions for falling asleep in class, so that it was very difficult to stay awake during class, much less concentrate on what was being said. Also, professor Cohen was very misleading about the nature of the course. He said he would not assume a lot of outside knowledge about biology, chemistry or physics, but the questions on tests did require an outside knowledge of such things. Also, the quizzes and final did not seem to be a fair evaluation of mastery of material. there were 7 10-15 question scantron quizzes throughout the quarter that was worth 75% of the grade. The questions did not seem to test concepts, but rather see if students memorized every anal detail that ws not necessary for understanding concepts. Also, the professor did not give quizzes back in a timely manner, so that students whose performance on quizzes was poor would not know that until after it was too late to make improvement (there were no more quizzes). The final was also a 50 question scantron test which was much like the quizzes. In general, my opinion of Professor Cohen is that he is too lazy to make the class a real class, and it was a waste of my time and money to take such a bad class. I feel frustrated that Dartmouth has such a poor quality class to offer students, and my only hope is that Cohen's class is an exception rather than the rule.\"",

My advice to anyone that wants to take the class though is this: Be ready for the level of detail that this class has. So much detail that every little thing matters. You can't get by in this class by just knowing the basic \"concept\". Be ready to study in DETAIL for the class. If you know this, and study hard, I suppose you'll be fine.

One of his own areas of research is memory and learning....so you can surely imagine that he would know how to teach well. Additionally, Bucci is just a really cool guy, and he makes class fun and exciting. Workload: Lots of reading; but it was interesting reading. We read a chapter for every class, and we used quite a few x-hours too. Each chapter was anywhere from 25 to 40 pages. For each chapter, we took a \"pre-quiz\" online before the class dedicated to that chapter (to make sure you read). The quizzes usually took under five minutes to complete, so they weren't a big deal at all. This course had a heavy reading load, but it was made more manageable by Prof. Bucci's \"Reading Guides\" --- he told us what to focus on in the chapter so we wouldn't get too caught up in the details.\"",

Plus, the class participation is evaluated so randomly. I know several people who missed only one or two classes and only got credit for 1/5 of the class participation points, which changed their grades dramatically. Professor: Although Bucci is a great lecturer, he was almost entirely unavailable to students. He even scheduled his office hour during our x-hour, which we usually had a lecture during. Sometimes he wouldn't even respond to emails until I had sent them two or three extra times. Here at Dartmouth, the focus is supposed to be on the undergrad, professors shouldn't be too busy with their own research to help students. Workload: The workload was fine but there were 6 exams, you have to read a dense chapter of neuroscience a night, and there's a nightly quiz that counts towards your grade. It wasn't a brutal amount of work, but it was pretty significant.\"",
            "review 5: \"11W with David Bucci: Bucci is extremely reasonable about this class. he doesn't expect to teach you everything about neuro. He wants you to learn the underlying biological mechanisms of neuroscience because things just wouldn't really make much sense without knowing how neurons interact and send messages, etc. Some people really don't enjoy this aspect of the course but i think it was pretty necessary. ANYWAY, it was completely reasonable because he taught a completely manageable amount of information. Yep, there were 3 exams and there probably 5-7 chapters on each exam, but that's pretty reasonable. If you try hard you can do well on all of the pre-chapter quizzes (he does this to make sure you're reading) and you get points just by answering the clicker-questions (to make sure you come to class). And, with t-points, you're able to really have control over your grade. The first exam everyone studied hard for and did well on, but the second exam people studied less hard for because they thought the first one was so easy. A lot of people did bad on this exam... DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. What you need to know: KNOW EVERY SINGLE THING ON HIS POWERPOINT. Like, I mean everything. With some exceptions, He doesn't really hold you responsible for things that are in the book but not in his lectures. So that means that every single thing (even anything little) on his powerpoint is fair game. Make sure to ASK QUESTIONS if he doesn't explain something on his power point! The thing I liked most about this class is that the objectives were always really clearly defined. We knew what each class period was going to be about, and we knew why we were learning what we were learning. Bucci tries to let us know why shit is important and relevant. You start off learning how neurons communicate with each other, and then you learn about sensory systems and motivation and movement and attention and stuff. It's a very sensible progression and you learn about how different structures in the brain relate to it. Even though I probably won't pursue neuro or psych just because the brain doesn't SUPER fascinate me, I think this class was well structured and definitely do-able, but you're going to need to put in some work.\"",

The exams were fair, but some questions were poorly worded and inhibited you from showing what you know. Prof. Bucci will help you outside of class if you seek it. He said he would try and break up the lectures with different activities or discussing a question with a neighbor.

All exams are also multiple choice, which makes it easy to do well, but the curve is also pretty harsh so you can't make to many mistakes. Bucci is a great prof and inspires interest in the subject, but the way the course was formatted made me attend lectures less and less frequently as the weeks progressed. All the exam questions were pretty much directly from the powerpoints so if you reviewed them you would do well The best thing about the psych/neuro department is the T-point system. They're fun to get if you sign up for experiments frequently (i didn't do a single one of his research summaries which were an alternative to experiments) and it's easy to get 8 t-points by the end of term, which automatically improves your grade by one step (say, a B+ to an A-) Take this course if you're interested in being a Neuro/Psych major or are just interested in the subject itself but beware of ending up not doing any work and losing interest in the subject.\"",

I'm going to major in Neuro now, so I'm probably a little biased, but I would definitely recommend taking this class. I wouldn't say it's easy but it's interesting enough for you to want to learn the material to do well. The tests can be a little tricky, but if you read the textbook, you'll do fine.

Bucci is a great lecturer and has a keen understanding of how humans learn. The format of the course makes it hard to fall behind on material, provided that you're going to class and taking the quizzes. Bucci is really helpful with answering questions inside and outside of class and lectures in a way that is reasonably fast-paced without being too difficult to follow. He makes it clear up front that it is important to do the assigned reading before coming to class, so as long as you do that you'll be fine. The few times I fell behind on the reading I got a little lost during the lectures, so it's important to stay on top of the readings...but they're pretty short and often interesting, so it's not too bad. This was probably my favorite class of those which I've taken for no reason other than to fill a distrib. Bucci really cares about his students and has a great sense of humor when lecturing. He's a really nice guy, very approachable, and knows his material very well. The few times that he didn't know the answer to a question, he was up front about it rather than trying to bs and confuse the students, which some of the other psych faculty have a tendency to do. Overall a great class. It's a bit of work, but definitely manageable and interesting most of the time. Great if you're looking for a fun way to get a SCI distrib.\"",

Prof Bucci is really great. It is his field of work so he tried to make this course as interesting, fun and easy as possible.

He was unclear on what material would be on his tests and I wish he had clarified... it would have saved a lot of grief when studying EVERYTHING for the test. The good part was dividing it into 5 NONcumulative tests, but this was foiled because he didn't divide the amount of material equally. The last test must have had less than half the material (and was 2x as easy) as the 4th test. Also, several people have told me about his snappy and unhelpful responses to blitzes, as well as his defensiveness during office hours when talking over tests. Also, if you find a mistake on a test when reviewing it afterwards with him (which is the only way to see the test in such a large class) and he gives you points back, he does NOT give any other people in the class these points back. And just because he gave you those points back does not mean he will automatically give you any points back when you go in to see him either. Overall not very consistent in this manner. On the other hand, his lectures inspired a lot of interest in the topic, for me. (The textbook is great, too.) He's genuinely interested in neuroscience (although he insinuates that he prefers research) and it comes through in the fun, exciting supplemental material he brings in during class.

The readings are not dull at all, although some chapters are long (around 20-30 pages) and you often have to read 2-3 chapters a week. The lectures are effective although Bucci often wastes a lot of time on unimportant things or has trouble answering student's questions causing us not to be able to go over a lot of material. But he is a very fair teacher and never expects us to know more for exams than he has included in lectures. On the other hand, some of his exam questions can be ridiculous. He often tests his students on an incredibly specific fact briefly mentioned in a lecture. For one exam, the questions were multiple sentences long and you spent more time reading the questions than answering them and most people ran out of time.\"",

The class is definitely really fast paced. Each class goes through one chapter of the textbook. Professor Cramer was a phenomenal lecturer. She explained concepts extremely well and used language incredibly well to convey her information. Important note taking is vital to review the lectures before each of the quizzes, but I never read the textbook chapter before the lecture and was able to take good notes and understand the lecture completely. No neuroscience knowledge is required, but knowing basic biology would be useful for the first half of the class. It is important to have the ability to effectively learn science as a topic to do well (i.e. constant reviewing of content, diagrams, flashcards, taking good notes). I definitely do not regret taking this class, although the grading system is intimidating (4 quizzes and 1 final determine the entire grade, with some extra credit opportunities and chances to re-earn points on the quizzes). But I felt that the quizzes were fair and not entirely demanding of all the content in the textbook, only the lectures.\"",

Neuroscience is incredibly interesting, do not get scared away by this class. It gets so much better in the higher level courses. Power though it when you have the time to spend a lot of time reading. By the end of this course though you will know the basics of neuroscience like the back of your hand. Tests are hard. She allows you to get points back by coming in for test corrections and this is a lifesaver. Definitely a weeder class for the neuro major.\"",

What's nice is that she posts the outline containing key terms as well as the slides before class. I would highly recommend printing out the slides 4 to a page and then taking notes on the slides during the lecture. Some other strategies that I found helpful were making a study guide as I did the readings based on terms from the outline and going to a study group through ASC. I agree with what the person said about Cramer being a fair grader - she gave me some points back when I went to see her during office hours and was happy to go over the test with me. Overall, this class was pretty good. It should definitely be your top priority class though as you go over a chapter a class and as you get deeper into the book, the chapters get progressively longer.\"",

Cramer is an amazing prof. Her lectures are super clear, interesting, and pretty much tell you all you need to know for the exams. I think one of the four quizzes had something exclusively from the textbook, but she warned us to read up on it. Other than that, I didn't use the book. The course is not hard to get an A in as long as you commit yourself to knowing the content. Go to office hours if something isn't clear, and I'd also recommend joining one of the study groups through Tutor Clearinghouse as a nice review before the quizzes.

For the tests you could do re-tests for and get some points back which really helped your grade and also helped w learning the material, and at the end of the quarter you could drop your lowest test grade. The class was interesting but definitely a lot of work- you basically go through an 800 page textbook and if you want to keep up with the class you are reading about 25-40 pages per class, which is MWF plus the X-hour which she used every week.

You HAVE to do the textbook readings because she will ask you questions on the exams about the tiniest details from the book. I personally did not enjoy the exams because you would have to do fill-in-the-blanks with no word bank for specific answers. However, she gave you an outline of each lecture and did make herself available to answer questions you may have. If you read the textbook in depth, attend the lectures, do the practice tests, and self test further (I think there's an online component you can purchase), it will be okay. Also, join a study group and find people to study with. You got to \"correct\" your test the day after you took it and could get some points back. We were allowed to work with people on this and it's easier to figure out what you got wrong/right by talking with others.\"",

Winter is a fairly boring lecturer and I did not feel super open to asking him questions, especially during quizzes. Every week, there is a quiz consisting of 2-3 chapters of the course. They are memorization-based, so it is hard to get a perfect score. Taking advantage of TA office hours were helpful -- the TA is also in charge of the term-long essay that sections are due throughout the term. Overall, the class has very little work, just tons of studying before each quiz. I would not recommend Winter personally, but I also understand the nature of the class is quick-paced and a broad scope of information to be covered.\"",

It is super bio/anatomy heavy, especially cellular and molecular biology. The material is pretty interesting, especially the content on behavior, language, learning, etc. I think the material is important- it feels like stuff that everyone should know. This course has an insane amount of curriculum- it is so jam-packed. We went through a textbook chapter each lecture. Professor Winter is very friendly and accommodating, and he's a good teacher overall, but he does have some flaws. He talks pretty fast (keeping up with note-taking during class is impossible, you have to go back and watch the recordings to fill in your notes), and he needs to do a better job prioritizing information. He gives too much time to very small details because he tends to explain and re-explain. He's not very concise or clear. When he re-explains a concept, he'll add to or revise his last explanation, and it becomes very confusing and convoluted. Prof Winter does teach the big ideas well, but spending more time on those concepts would help solidify them. The tiny details seem unimportant for an intro class, especially when the big ideas need a bit more attention. Initially, I was excited about the course structure (weekly quizzes and a term paper, but no tests or exams), until I realized how hard the weekly quizzes were. The first one was easy, but they got much more challenging as the material got more detailed and advanced. Because of how much material each lecture had, it felt like I was studying for an exam each week. The term paper assignment was split into four parts, each with a rough and final draft, making it very manageable. If you pick an interesting topic, researching for and writing the paper can be enjoyable. The TA gave feedback on and graded our papers- she was very helpful and fair. Overall, it's interesting material, but it's a difficult course. Only take it if you have to, or if you are very interested in the material\"",

Winter's lectures were very informational and in depth, but could be boring at time because they were very dense. I definitely learned a lot in the class, but I found that the quizzes were focused on the most irrelevant or minute details that even 5 seconds of daydreaming in the class would cost you a whole letter grade on the quiz (because they were only 8-12 questions each). Having strong biology background is definitely helpful, as is watching the ponopto video for every single lecture over again since he goes so fast. Overall, I learned a lot, but I don't think grading and assessments accurately will accurately reflect how well you know the material.\"",

I knew a class like this would not be easy, but professor winter made it a painful experience for me. He focused on the oddest details that were so irrelevant in the long scheme. He never focused on the important or major ideas on quiz assessments. He often explained material incorrect and extremely contradictory to the textbook. He switched to paper quizzes half way through, and with that, stopped letting us see what we were getting wrong- where is the learning in that??? If you take this class, be prepared for a lot of self study. I honestly found it most helpful to not even go to class, but instead, watch the recorded lectures on your own time with the textbook right in front of you to catch his many mistakes. He did make himself very available for office hours, so I will give him credit where it was due. He also talked very very fast, glossed over things I believe should not have been glossed over, and when he would revisit topics, he would often explain them differently which was very confusing. Overall, this wasn\u2019t the worst class, but it was definitely a negative experience for me. Not incredibly horrible to get a good grade, and be PROACTIVE about T points. But if this isn\u2019t for your major or you are not a nerd for neuroscience I would not recommend taking it.\"",

The research paper was very straightforward: you only had to turn in a total of 4 pages, one page at a time very spaced out throughout the term, it could be on anything you wanted, and the TA graded very fairly. The quizzes weren't cumulative throughout the whole course: they'd only be on 3-4 chapters in the textbook. There was no final or midterm, which was nice. Overall, a lot of the topics we learned about were very interesting and you had the opportunity to explore a subject of particular interest in the paper.

You read four chapters per two-week unit, which are about 40 pages each. The test grading system was not my favorite - it was based on percentiles, that is, your grade depended on how everyone else did. The problem is that this pins students against one another...not a great strategy. The class is extremely fast paced. I think Psych would be better fit with a separate intro class for each field, because there is too much information crammed into to small a time period. Professors often have to pick and chose what they lecture on, and the rest you have to teach to yourself. The class is pretty much memorization, so brace yourselves. Kelley was great...I'd definitely take another class with him. His lectures were extremely entertaining, and he did a good job conveying his points. Wheatley was excellent. While her class wasn't the same \"fun\" atmosphere as Kelley, her lectures were among the best I've seen here at Dartmouth. You leave the class knowing exactly what she wanted you to understand, and not at all bored. Kleck was pretty good - his personality is great, but I sometimes got lost as to what he was trying to do in his lectures. He gave great examples, but often failed to tie them to concrete concepts. Tse, on the other hand, was downright terrible. His lectures were all over the place, with no sense of order or organization. His test was absurd, often asking questions relating to sheer specifics (who invented this theory), rather than concepts (what is this theory). One prof I will avoid like the plague in the future. Bottom line - If you want to take another psych class, take it - it's not awful, and probably worth it in the long run. If you're not thinking of majoring though, I'd say stay away.

You'll love to go to class--the professors are all great Lecturers and crack funny jokes. The material we had to learn for the tests was so interesting. It's a course that every college student should take before they graduate. Be aware: you learn only 20% of what you will be tested on in lecture. 80% you have to learn on your own from the text book. Also, the curve is very very harsh. If you're all about getting good grades, this is not the course for you. It's not an easy A by any means. Advice: 1) Make sure you go over all your old tests for the final (it will be the most important piece of studying you do). 2) Go to the text book website (http://www.wwnorton.com/college/psych/psychsci3/ch/01/flashcards.aspx) to download flash card sheets (excel or word sheets that have all the bold words defined for the chapter). 3) If you're a girl, sign up for T-point experiments at the beginning of the week before they disappear--it's harder for girls to sign up for experiments because many of them are all-male. 4) Don't do all the readings the night before. 5) Get to know the professors and ask lots of questions. They're cool people that you might end up wanting to do research with in their lab. They'll also drop you good tips and hints about studying for upcoming exams.\"",

It's rough to survive, you either a. have credit from AP test (so you can get of this class) or b. have to tough it out I think the profs are brilliant and they really encourage me to go on with the major since I'm not terribly happy with my grade. It's like I'm above the median, but that still means very little when the median is artificially set soo low. But the profs make it semi-worth it, I'd say. Trust me, everyone b**tched and moaned about this class. Even the people who did super well complained about how much reading there is and how dense the material is. But I guess, if you have to take it, take it. My advice to you: - read the book before you even get to class. There's just too much reading and you'll feel swamped with 2 other classes - if you're satisfied with a B, okay, you'll most likely be fine. You can read once and get roughly the median or a little below. But to be above the median is hardddd. Getting an A requires so much effort that some people would just prefer to allot more time to other classes - go to office hours. the profs will try their best to help you - don't just transcribe notes. actually UNDERSTAND them first, then underline. don't waste time recopying notes. you will realize that you don't have any time good luck!\"",

Unfortunately, the test seems to reward specific facts rather than understanding of the material-- so it's good if you're good at memorizing, but not so good if you prefer application/concepts.\"",

The boring lectures were largely useless in preparing for the exam as most of the questions, which are multiple choice, are from the textbook. Some of the questions are fair while others are just surprising. You must memorize the textbook and stay awake while reading its painful chapters to do well in this class.

As much as people complain about the multiple-choice test format of this class, I can honestly say psych 1 was my only class where my grade was always a function of my studying. The tests I stayed up later studying for (because I pushed it to the last minute) I did worse on, while the ones I really prepared for I did well on. Because a lot of the material is only in the textbook you have to do the reading and make your own study materials. However, the concepts are not hard to grasp, it's just a lot to remember. If it wasn't multiple choice it would be a lot harder. The curve is tough, and can disadvantage people who get below the median, but generally it works out so people get the grade they deserve. Also, if you take this class get your t-points!!! So many people don't take advantage of this free extra credit.

            "review 57: \"05W with Ann Clark: Psych 1 is a lot of fun! Four profs taught this course: Ann Clarke (neurobiology and abnormal psych), Russell Hughes (learning, sensory processes, perception, and cognition), Todd Heatherton (developmental and personality psych), and Robert Kleck (social psych). All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology. There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy). The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals. The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully. Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so. This converts the exam median grade of B-/B into a final median grade of B or B+. Take this class! You'll love it!\"",

Then he'd dismiss \"class\" 15 minutes early. Grafton was, by far, the worst professor I've encountered in my entire time at Dartmouth (and I've completed 11 classes at this point). He had a very disturbing attitude of: \"let me put up random illusions and mind games and I won't explain their connection to the course material. if you figure it out, great for you, and if you don't, that's great, too.\" Grafton was never available the 3 weeks that he taught class. He rarely responded to emails and was apparently out of town all the time when he wasn't in class. Robert Kleck, who taught a portion of the course, and Ann Clark, were very informative and helpful during office hours. Their portions of the course were bearable. But at the end of the course, Neil Macrae came in and did nothing but crack jokes about his accent. He, too, was very unresponsive to student needs and threw on random videos to kill time. Folks, don't waste $3000+ of tuition for a class where the teacher will come in and throw on random videos and illusions on the overhead to kill time. I took this course two terms ago with these folks, and I honestly don't remember anything from it. I learned nothing, and I know from talking to several of my classmates that many people agree with me.\"",

Prof. Clark took a biological approach, and her lectures were fairly dry and the material was not all that interesting. Second, Prof. Hughes, the Perception prof. was a highly animated and engaging lecturer. I would recommend him strongly for this course and others. Third, Prof. Heatherton, with an emphasis on child development, lectured engagingly, however too quickly. He tried to cram too much material onto the Power Point slides. Last, Prof. Kleck, the course chair, held some remarkably cogent and satisfying lectures. He went with the old-school overhead projector and transparencies and accompanied these with an engaging style of lecture, very often adding anecdotal tales and drawing comparisons to Dartmouth itself.

            "review 15: \"06W with William Kelley: The class was fairly good. It was intro to psychology. That basically sums it up, from a material perspective. You cover a broad spectrum of material, from behavior psychology, learning psychology, brain anatomy, etc. The class has 4 sections with 4 separate professors. Don't be fooled, as many people have been in the past, by the fact that Bill Kelley is listed as the professor for this class; he is just the course chair and teaches only 2.5 weeks, just like the other 3 sections. The class starts off with Jernstedt, who was a very knowledgeable professor. He definitely knew his stuff and he teaches well. Since it is about learning, it is fairly useful to your life, so it isn't a waste. The second section was Kelley, who taught the section on memory. The classes were very fun and though you learned the least in this section, you learned it well and was a blast. Seriously, it involved the Price is Right and playing DDR. The third section was taught by Groh, who was, bar none, the worst professor I've met at Dartmouth so far. Even though she seems like a very nice woman, she has no idea how to teach. My problems with her range from the basic, like writing on the board with the lights in Filene (where this class is always taught) dimmed to the point where no one can read what she is writing. Other problems would were that she dropped technical terms without realizing none of us knew what they meant and then defining it at the end of the lecture when someone finally asked her. She has a tendency to overcomplicate things (she said the tastes we have were salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami, which she threw in there solely to confuse us, since it was not asked on any subsequent exam). The review for the exam was awful since the \"review sheet\" were her lecture notes, which were undecipherable, in that they were clearly written for a PhD to lecture off of. Basically, she was a horrendous professor. The course wrapped up with Kleck, who was a fantastic professor. He has been at the college for forever and is incredibly knowledgeable. The exams are all 50 questions, roughly 70% straight from the text, rest from the lectures, which really devalues going to class, but that's what it is. They are fairly hard, but are curved, so you'll be OK. There is also extra credit (T-points) which basically means you get credits for participating in psych experiments (MRIs or experiments). Do all 8 hours and you get boosted up half a letter grade. Basically it's a good class, but not a typical intro class.\"",

Prof. Groh's lectures were straightforward and unimaginative, but effective. The other three professors really seemed to get into lectures and make a lot of effort to make them interesting, different, and exciting. It was like they were all thinking, \"it's just Psych 1, let's have a good time.\" Like, Prof. Kelley had a girl play DDR during class. Maybe it just seemed like these three were really entertaining and Prof. Groh was dry and boring because it's a lot harder to make the physical study of the brain interesting than studies of behavior, etc. Overall, the lectures are usually interesting, the book sucks (I didn't read much of it, which is not the best idea), and it's kind of weird to have your grade in a class based entirely on five multiple-choice tests.\"",

If I had more time left on campus, I would pursue more courses in the Psych Department. The professors were excellent. The course is divided up by four professors, each teaching for about two weeks. I enjoyed all of them and would take courses with them in the future. There are tons of freshmen in the class. We spent the first class period explaining the basic structure of the course, including the definition of an x-hour. At first, they all come to every class and somehow were wide awake by 10am, ready to chat it up with the other freshmen sitting around them. As the term went on, their enthusiasm adjusted to normal levels, but until then it can get on your nerves. Also, many of them love to sit in class taking notes on their laptops.

The department, however, is pretty much divided between social psych classes and neuro-science classes. Most people tend to be more interested in one of these two areas. Psych 1, covers both a lot of neuro-science and a lot of social psych. So, the science kids sit there through the social psych thinking that it's all BS, and the social kids sit there through the neuro-science wondering why on earth they have to learn about \"neurotransmitters\" and \"synapses.\" There is a ton of reading, much more than you would expect from an intro class, and it tends to be very dry. The tests are all 50 multiple choice questions, which I think is very unfair considering the amount of material that they cover.

This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different. Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies. Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though. Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either). Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland. I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material. Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.\"",

Tests were ridiculous. Some questions didn't even check if you understood the material, they just checked if you showed up to class. Definitely possible to get an A, but it requires a lot of time and energy. You have to memorize every little thing from the textbook and the lectures because the test questions are so specific, but you also don't know if they will focus mostly on the lectures or textbook. Textbook reading was a lot, but I learned more from the textbook than from the lectures. I did not find the course interesting at all while taking it; I just found it tedious. After the class was over, however, I realized what I learned was actually super intriguing, they just did a poor job of constructing the class.

Wheatley and Duchaine's lectures were fascinating, and we learned about specific experiments in each class which drove home the points made. This class made me want to take more psych classes in the future, even though I'm not considering a major/minor. I averaged around 90% on exams (30 multiple choice questions each, with the final being 45), which along with the data science project (graded on completion) and T-points (easy to get if you check the website frequently and take advantage of opportunities early) was enough to get an A (with a B median this term). Group exams had little value other than reviewing the test and reassuring myself of which questions I got right (and which ones I likely didn't). Don't expect it to help your grade significantly. I did read every word of the textbook (found as a pdf online - don't buy it!!!), which I found crucial to both reinforcing material discussed in lectures and learning some material that was on exams but not discussed. You could probably get away with just reading the section summaries at the end of each chapter and noting key words bolded in the text. InQuizitive was also really helpful, and I found the $25 subscription to be pretty worth it. Many of the test questions are based on the lectures, though, so make sure you review videos, specific experiments, and key concepts discussed, and you should be fine. I missed a few classes during the term for medical reasons, but lectures and slides were posted and I found those to be sufficient. It probably helped that I took this class mostly for fun and so I actually enjoyed reading the textbook and attending class, so beware if you're a try-hard freshman.

I legit did not open up the textbook all term and am probably gonna finish with a B+ if not an A- lol. Yes, the class is your standard intro class (and I think either this or Intro Anthro is the biggest class here, about 200 kids) and Wheatley clearly knows how to teach but Brad is here because he has an impressive research background. They're both very nice; if you're looking for help in the class, go to Wheatley/the TA; if you want a speedy response, go to Brad. Your entire grade is 4 30-question Scantron multiple choice tests (the fourth and final test is 45 questions, 30 about the last chapter and 15 cumulative). There are only two versions of the purely multiple choice tests and three proctors (Duchaine, Wheatley, and the TA). None of them are paying attention, and because the seats are so close to each other in Moore Filene, you can look at the test of the person two seats over from you on your left and right if you're really that desperate. It was frustrating; I was trying hard and bombing some tests but all these people around me were cheating. They make clear at the beginning of the course that the tests are roughly 33% lecture material, 33% textbook material, and 33% overlap. My friends tried to do the incredibly long textbook readings to scour for information that would be tested, but they cherry-pick the most trivial, random details from the textbook so it was nearly pointless to read the textbook imo. Your best bet is to really pay attention to lectures, rewatch the recordings that they post on Canvas if you'd like, and use the info you get from those lectures to deduce what the best answer will be for the textbook questions. If you implement this strategy, you shouldn't get below an 80% on any test. Max out on T-Points (extra credit which can give you I think a max of 2.6% grade boost), and ask Wheatley/the TA for help throughout the course. Also: go to study group sessions led by ASC paid-tutors. They meet weekly and legit go over like 60% of what's gonna be covered on the test (specifically the stuff in the textbook too); one hour a week in those meetings is way more valuable than 3-4 hours of reading the textbook. Very interesting material and good intro to the psych department.\"",
            "review 15: \"21F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: The fundamental thing to know before taking this class is that it is basically like watching a prerecorded lecture due to the size of the class. There isn't participation really and honestly it might have been easier for me to just use the recorded lectures instead of going to class because that way I could even pause to take notes. The size of the class as well as the amount of content covered in the course leaves this class as a unique experience to me. I took AP Psych as a senior, and even though I didn't remember a ton from the course and it wasn't all overlap, it was definitely helpful to have that background. If you don't have a background in psych, I would recommend reading the textbook well before the exams to familiarize yourself and be able to understand the lecture material. The exams seemed to be written by Duchaine, and would often have direct references to lectures by saying like \"In Prof Duchaine's lecture on memory...\". Duchaine definitely focuses more on giving you content to write down while Wheatley likes to take her time and explain concepts, as well as show videos. Overall, I found the class very interesting and found myself referencing studies we learned about to my friends often. I believe I will be ending with an A or A-, which is also thanks to the extra credit opportunities. If you do the T-points (earned from participating in psych studies) throughout the term, you can get enough to raise your grade by a whole letter.\"",

Let's go through what's difficult about it first: you cover a 15 chapter textbook in ten weeks, and the professors expect you to read all of it. That's a lot of reading, and you have to be diligent and organized about it if you don't want to be overwhelmed. The tests, though they're just 30 multiple choice questions, are also quite difficult. Think AP-style questions but a little bit more challenging. There were only a few times when I found the questions to be unfair or unclear, but if you don't know your information well (both from the textbook and the lectures) they're going to be quite tough. You take tests both as an individual and as a group though (the individual component being 85% of your final text grade and the group component 15%) and I quite liked that structure. The good? Both Wheatley and Duchaine are very capable lecturers, fluent and clear in their description of the subject material. Many describe Duchaine as being more dry than Wheatley, and I tend to agree, but I still thoroughly enjoyed Duchaine's lectures. Wheatley incorporated more interactive activities and videos into her lectures, while Duchaine focused more on getting through a greater amount of material. 90% of the time that he tried to incorporate a video into class we didn't have time to watch it! That being said, they presented their material in an engaging manner and there was never a time where I found myself wishing I had just skipped class. Both professors talk about their current research, which I think is awesome: you might get the chance to hear about some cutting-edge findings that haven't even been published yet! If you're interested in learning more about PSYC, I'd definitely recommend this class. But don't take it during a term where you know you're going to have other challenging classes.

Professor Duchaine focused more on getting through a lot of information, while Professor Wheatley tended to have more interactive demonstrations during her lectures. My recommendation for lectures is to print out the slides beforehand to write notes alongside the pictures/diagrams. Sometimes I needed more space, but it helped to have the information mostly in one place. Homework is textbook reading, usually 1-2 chapters per week meaning you get through 15 chapters over the course of the term. My recommendation for textbook reading is just to stay on top of it. It is a lot of content and a good amount of it is fair game for exams. I don't agree with reviews that say you can get away with not reading the textbook if you want to score well on exams. The professors said that the exam would cover ~50% lecture material and ~50% textbook material at the beginning of the term, and I would say that it was a pretty accurate split. There were 3 midterm exams and a final exam, all of which followed the same format: 40-45 Scantron questions individually that counted for 85% of the exam grade followed by taking the same questions in groups of 4, which counted for 15% of the exam grade. There is also a Data Science project that is relatively easy and a nice grade boost. I strongly recommend investing in Inquisitive as a study tool, as some of the trickiest exam questions were easy if you went through the chapter reviews.

These were super doable as each quiz only needed to have 350-450 words total (so like 125-200 words for each question). Besides watching the Canvas lectures, we also had to read the textbook and then complete Inquisitives which are quizzes made by the textbook company for each chapter. You didn't need to get 100% on each of these quizzes, just 70%. Lastly, there were ZAPs which are basically online activities made by the textbook company and these took maybe 10-15 min max to complete. I think the ZAPs were graded on completion only. The workload for this class was not that bad and the profs were super flexible and understanding. Everything related to the textbook was due the last day of class. And while the essay quizzes were due a week after they were assigned, you were allowed to turn in four late without any penalty. Duchaine's lectures were okay - he's a decent explainer but he does like to go on tangents and his lecture videos were somehow SIGNIFICANTLY longer than Wheatley's.

While Professor Duchaine's lecture videos can be a little more hefty than Professor Wheatley's, all the lectures are still on intriguing topics and aren't boring by any means, but yeah Wheatley's lectures were really good. They are also both highly regarded in their fields so you are learning from some of the best. Wheatley's work is even referenced in the textbook on multiple occassions which was cool. The majority of the class is the quizzes, which are 60% of the grade. There are two quizzes a week and they are all based on the lecture videos that you watched. These quizzes are relatively easy as you're allowed to access your notes on the quiz, so as long as you take detailed notes on something like Google Docs, you can just look up the question in your document and use the professor's exact words for an answer. The only thing is you do have to answer about 10-12 questions in 30 minutes so you can't always give long winded responses and you have to work a little fast, but it's nothing extreme and super manageable. Also, your two lowest quiz grades are dropped at the end of the term so if you can't study for one or have something in the way, you don't even have to worry about it. The rest of the class is just homework which was even easier. The Inquizitives (which are 30% of the grade) are multiple choice questions based on the textbook (none of the textbook material is on any of the quizzes btw), and you can get as many questions wrong as you want, it will deduct points but you can just keep going till you get an ideal score. Honestly, you don't even have to read the textbook to answer them because you can search up key terms and find the answers, but the information was interesting so I chose to. Next, 5% comes from super these easy zap labs that are just a comprehensive 4 question multiple choice thing that you would have to try and get wrong. Then, the last 5% comes from article write-ups which is just reading some psychology articles and answering 5 or so questions. Some of these articles were a little more dense, but shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Additionally, if you do these extra credit experiments that they post throughout the term, you can get up to 16 points of extra credit (the class is out of 500 total points so its like 3.2% of a grade boost) and none take more than 45 minutes to do. For most of them you just sit on your computer and answer super simple questions or do easy tasks, it's nothing serious.

The main body of your workload comes from that and the weekly quizzes based on the lectures. Type up what your instructors say in the lectures, to include the exposition they give about research studies, principles, and little stories they tell about themselves. Everything in the lectures can be included in the quizzes,and the questions get REALLY specific. I wouldn't call them unfair, but if you aren't a fast typer, having your notes pre-typed will allow you to copy-paste responses (all the questions are open-ended).

            "review 33: \"20F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: The remote format for PSYC 1 was as follows: Monday interviews with professors, Wednesday/Friday \u201csections\u201d (35-minute small group discussions) with quizzes (30 minutes; 17 total, 15 counting toward the grade), weekly textbook quizzes (easy 100%), weekly ZAP assignments (short modules), and 5 article reviews. It was very easy to stay on top of your grade, but this came at the expense of an enjoyable learning experience. Covering 15 textbook chapters in 9 weeks means essentially zooming through the textbook as fast as you can in order to get to the quizzes. Each quiz was open-notes, but there were so many of them that eventually they became extremely taxing and monotonous to prepare for. Professor Duchaine\u2019s lectures were a pain to get through sometimes (not to mention his excessive focus on prosopagnosia, which is understandable given his research focus), especially because his external videos were not embedded in the lectures themselves. Professor Wheatley\u2019s lectures were significantly more interesting and engaging, and I enjoyed the weeks during which she posted videos more than those with Duchaine. Some of the lecture videos were quite long (exceeding 90 minutes), and because all of the quiz material came from the videos, it felt necessary to take notes on almost everything said in the videos, which extended the time commitment significantly. The Monday interviews were cool, but some of the enjoyment was sapped by the fact that I felt like I had to take notes on EVERYTHING in order to prepare for the quizzes (the interview material was included on at least one of the quizzes for that week). I was not a fan of \u201csection\u201d at all; while my undergrad TA kept the conversation going as best they could, I found that I gained essentially nothing from an awkward breakout room discussion. If you study for the quiz ahead of time, you will have no desire to contribute to the conversation and will essentially sit there until the quiz starts. Overall, PSYC 1 was a decent experience - I still enjoyed the class but was not as academically engaged as I could have been on campus (obviously).\"",

I will give examples in the domains of diversity, timezones, and general accommodations. DIVERSITY: all the guest lecturers were white, and most from economically advantaged backgrounds. I didn't see anyone who looked like me, and this lack of diversity leaked into course material. E.g. we were taught how bad parenting generally doesn't affect personality and other childhood outcomes. This can be used as evidence against the origins of mental health crises and racial disparities. Racial disparities were never discussed in class. TIMEZONES: If you don't live in EST, know that the professors will expect you to get up at 5am for their office hours, as they don't respond to emails asking for alternative office hour times. ACCOMMODATION: I emailed a professor asking about redoing a quiz due to a covid crisis at home (short story: my family member contracted covid and I needed to care for them) and the professor said that they wouldn't know what to do, refusing any makeup and refusing to give other alternatives. This didn't make sense given that there was a mention of makeup quizzes in the syllabus, and I found this lack of concern incredibly apathetic. Given Black Lives Matter and all that has happened this year, I leave this class disillusioned over the psychology department, and am hesitant to take future classes.\"",

The recorded lectures were fascinating though Duchaine's sometimes got a bit long winded. I feel like overall there was less memorization online but you still spent just as much time working on psych since you had class time as well as prerecorded lectures. The weekly quizzes worked well for me since they were low stakes and you didn't have to study a ton for them. Some of the quizzes were a bit long but seemed to be a better length towards the end of the term.

The course offers interesting material with an easy workload will most likely inspire (as it has to many in the past) people to if not major/minor in psych, to definitely take further classes in the department. This is the ultimate survey course. If you've ever wondered what (research, clinical, etc.) psychologists study and what Dartmouth's PBS professors are like, this is a golden opportunity to find out. You learn about over a dozen topics taught by four different professors (including the Chair this term). While I expected by mere probability alone one's bound to be amazing and another to be atrocious, all four professors (plus a new professor who acted as a sub one day) were great. They were all able to engross students in their interesting respective fields. We laughed, we gasped, and we learned. BTW, I've heard from a Psych Professor that the fall Psych 1 lineup in comparison to the other terms is stronger than the other terms since that is when the bulk of the Dartmouth students take the course. While the Winter or Spring term courses may be smaller, classes are purely lecture, so don't expect to benefit from a class of 120 students rather than 170. The tests are multiple choice, and fairly frequent (spaced roughly 2.5 weeks apart), with three unit tests throughout the term, and then the fourth plus the final cumulative exam during finals week (one unit test per professor). While some questions can be tricky, most aren't that hard, and at the end of the day, MC tests merely gauge recognition, so you don't have to go as overboard studying as you would for practically every other class you'd take. As for the textbook, ours was 677 pages, and we were responsible for reading practically all of it. It's really not that bad, as it is broken up into 1/4 for each test, the book has a lot of pictures (and other fill) and was interesting for the most part. Anyone who complains about there being too much reading or having to \"memorize everything\" just isn't used to having to digest so much reading or studying properly for such a test. Just find a friend, split the chapter assignment in half, and outline the chapters. Reread the outlines 2-4 times, and the lecture notes, and you're ready.

All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology. There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy). The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals. The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully. Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so.

Clark was ehhh, just regular, nothing special, she covered a lot of the nitty gritty areas, though, like brain function and types of drugs and such. Hughes was terrible - constantly went off topic and lost track of what he was saying, not that any of it was important anyway, except of course the only thing I got out of those two weeks - lateral inhibition. Nice guy though. Heatherton was my favorite, his lectures were extremely interesting, and he related to the students best out of all of the teachers. And he showed lots of videos, including a 10 minute montage of When Harry Met Sally on Valentine's Day. Nice touch. I definitely want to take a class with Heatherton again. Kleck was also very good - he's got the most experience and he's probably the best lecturer. His topics were interesting as well, but not as personal as Heatherton's (e.g. Kleck spoke about obedience, Heatherton spoke about relationships). Kleck is a little intimidating, both intellectually and physically, and he's a bit out of step with the students, but all in all the positives way out weigh the negatives.

This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different. Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies. Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though. Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either). Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland. I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material. Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.\"",

Let's go through what's difficult about it first: you cover a 15 chapter textbook in ten weeks, and the professors expect you to read all of it. That's a lot of reading, and you have to be diligent and organized about it if you don't want to be overwhelmed. The tests, though they're just 30 multiple choice questions, are also quite difficult. Think AP-style questions but a little bit more challenging. There were only a few times when I found the questions to be unfair or unclear, but if you don't know your information well (both from the textbook and the lectures) they're going to be quite tough. You take tests both as an individual and as a group though (the individual component being 85% of your final text grade and the group component 15%) and I quite liked that structure. The good? Both Wheatley and Duchaine are very capable lecturers, fluent and clear in their description of the subject material. Many describe Duchaine as being more dry than Wheatley, and I tend to agree, but I still thoroughly enjoyed Duchaine's lectures. Wheatley incorporated more interactive activities and videos into her lectures, while Duchaine focused more on getting through a greater amount of material. 90% of the time that he tried to incorporate a video into class we didn't have time to watch it! That being said, they presented their material in an engaging manner and there was never a time where I found myself wishing I had just skipped class. Both professors talk about their current research, which I think is awesome: you might get the chance to hear about some cutting-edge findings that haven't even been published yet! If you're interested in learning more about PSYC, I'd definitely recommend this class. But don't take it during a term where you know you're going to have other challenging classes.

The size of the class as well as the amount of content covered in the course leaves this class as a unique experience to me. I took AP Psych as a senior, and even though I didn't remember a ton from the course and it wasn't all overlap, it was definitely helpful to have that background. If you don't have a background in psych, I would recommend reading the textbook well before the exams to familiarize yourself and be able to understand the lecture material. The exams seemed to be written by Duchaine, and would often have direct references to lectures by saying like \"In Prof Duchaine's lecture on memory...\". Duchaine definitely focuses more on giving you content to write down while Wheatley likes to take her time and explain concepts, as well as show videos. Overall, I found the class very interesting and found myself referencing studies we learned about to my friends often.

Yes, the class is your standard intro class (and I think either this or Intro Anthro is the biggest class here, about 200 kids) and Wheatley clearly knows how to teach but Brad is here because he has an impressive research background. They're both very nice; if you're looking for help in the class, go to Wheatley/the TA; if you want a speedy response, go to Brad. Your entire grade is 4 30-question Scantron multiple choice tests (the fourth and final test is 45 questions, 30 about the last chapter and 15 cumulative). There are only two versions of the purely multiple choice tests and three proctors (Duchaine, Wheatley, and the TA). None of them are paying attention, and because the seats are so close to each other in Moore Filene, you can look at the test of the person two seats over from you on your left and right if you're really that desperate. It was frustrating; I was trying hard and bombing some tests but all these people around me were cheating. They make clear at the beginning of the course that the tests are roughly 33% lecture material, 33% textbook material, and 33% overlap. My friends tried to do the incredibly long textbook readings to scour for information that would be tested, but they cherry-pick the most trivial, random details from the textbook so it was nearly pointless to read the textbook imo. Your best bet is to really pay attention to lectures, rewatch the recordings that they post on Canvas if you'd like, and use the info you get from those lectures to deduce what the best answer will be for the textbook questions. If you implement this strategy, you shouldn't get below an 80% on any test. Max out on T-Points (extra credit which can give you I think a max of 2.6% grade boost), and ask Wheatley/the TA for help throughout the course. Also: go to study group sessions led by ASC paid-tutors. They meet weekly and legit go over like 60% of what's gonna be covered on the test (specifically the stuff in the textbook too); one hour a week in those meetings is way more valuable than 3-4 hours of reading the textbook. Very interesting material and good intro to the psych department.\"",
            "review 22: \"21F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: I took this course as my third class alongside two major courses (I'm a junior), both for the distrib and also just to learn more about psych, a field which I've always been interested in but never studied in a formal setting. Wheatley and Duchaine's lectures were fascinating, and we learned about specific experiments in each class which drove home the points made. This class made me want to take more psych classes in the future, even though I'm not considering a major/minor. I averaged around 90% on exams (30 multiple choice questions each, with the final being 45), which along with the data science project (graded on completion) and T-points (easy to get if you check the website frequently and take advantage of opportunities early) was enough to get an A (with a B median this term). Group exams had little value other than reviewing the test and reassuring myself of which questions I got right (and which ones I likely didn't). Don't expect it to help your grade significantly. I did read every word of the textbook (found as a pdf online - don't buy it!!!), which I found crucial to both reinforcing material discussed in lectures and learning some material that was on exams but not discussed. You could probably get away with just reading the section summaries at the end of each chapter and noting key words bolded in the text. InQuizitive was also really helpful, and I found the $25 subscription to be pretty worth it. Many of the test questions are based on the lectures, though, so make sure you review videos, specific experiments, and key concepts discussed, and you should be fine. I missed a few classes during the term for medical reasons, but lectures and slides were posted and I found those to be sufficient. It probably helped that I took this class mostly for fun and so I actually enjoyed reading the textbook and attending class, so beware if you're a try-hard freshman. You probably won't enjoy it if you're just looking for the grade.\"",
            "review 23: \"21F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: Tough but really amazing class. The concepts and lessons were awesome, but the class itself was difficult. Don't waste your time on the textbook unless you have time to spare. The textbook questions on each test are oftentimes incredibly niche so either dedicate yourself fully to memorizing a few chapters of information, or simply focus on the lectures and some vocab to secure a decently high score. As someone who spent hours on the textbook, I consistently scored lower than my friends who focused more on the lectures and then skimmed a few pages before each test.\"",
            "review 24: \"21F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: This is a good course with engaging material and a manageable workload. Class was 3 days a week and mostly consisted of note-taking with occasional time for questions. Professor Duchaine focused more on getting through a lot of information, while Professor Wheatley tended to have more interactive demonstrations during her lectures. My recommendation for lectures is to print out the slides beforehand to write notes alongside the pictures/diagrams. Sometimes I needed more space, but it helped to have the information mostly in one place. Homework is textbook reading, usually 1-2 chapters per week meaning you get through 15 chapters over the course of the term. My recommendation for textbook reading is just to stay on top of it. It is a lot of content and a good amount of it is fair game for exams. I don't agree with reviews that say you can get away with not reading the textbook if you want to score well on exams. The professors said that the exam would cover ~50% lecture material and ~50% textbook material at the beginning of the term, and I would say that it was a pretty accurate split. There were 3 midterm exams and a final exam, all of which followed the same format: 40-45 Scantron questions individually that counted for 85% of the exam grade followed by taking the same questions in groups of 4, which counted for 15% of the exam grade. There is also a Data Science project that is relatively easy and a nice grade boost. I strongly recommend investing in Inquisitive as a study tool, as some of the trickiest exam questions were easy if you went through the chapter reviews. If you use Inquisitive and have good lecture/textbook notes, it is very doable to do well in this course.\"",

            "review 27: \"20S with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: Since this term was online, the format of the class was a little different. We had to watch lectures on Canvas and then take untimed, open-note \"essay\" quizzes on them. The quizzes had 2-3 questions each and basically asked you to reflect on the lecture videos. These were super doable as each quiz only needed to have 350-450 words total (so like 125-200 words for each question). Besides watching the Canvas lectures, we also had to read the textbook and then complete Inquisitives which are quizzes made by the textbook company for each chapter. You didn't need to get 100% on each of these quizzes, just 70%. Lastly, there were ZAPs which are basically online activities made by the textbook company and these took maybe 10-15 min max to complete. I think the ZAPs were graded on completion only. The workload for this class was not that bad and the profs were super flexible and understanding. Everything related to the textbook was due the last day of class. And while the essay quizzes were due a week after they were assigned, you were allowed to turn in four late without any penalty. Duchaine's lectures were okay - he's a decent explainer but he does like to go on tangents and his lecture videos were somehow SIGNIFICANTLY longer than Wheatley's. Wheatley's lectures were amazing - they were super interesting and she explained concepts very concisely. Her videos also made me more interested in social psychology. Overall, this course was great and I'm glad that I took it.\"",

            "review 30: \"20F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: Although the course material was interesting, the class was well organized, and I leave the term with an A, I feel disappointed in how the professors have handled inequalities due to COVID. I will give examples in the domains of diversity, timezones, and general accommodations. DIVERSITY: all the guest lecturers were white, and most from economically advantaged backgrounds. I didn't see anyone who looked like me, and this lack of diversity leaked into course material. E.g. we were taught how bad parenting generally doesn't affect personality and other childhood outcomes. This can be used as evidence against the origins of mental health crises and racial disparities. Racial disparities were never discussed in class. TIMEZONES: If you don't live in EST, know that the professors will expect you to get up at 5am for their office hours, as they don't respond to emails asking for alternative office hour times. ACCOMMODATION: I emailed a professor asking about redoing a quiz due to a covid crisis at home (short story: my family member contracted covid and I needed to care for them) and the professor said that they wouldn't know what to do, refusing any makeup and refusing to give other alternatives. This didn't make sense given that there was a mention of makeup quizzes in the syllabus, and I found this lack of concern incredibly apathetic. Given Black Lives Matter and all that has happened this year, I leave this class disillusioned over the psychology department, and am hesitant to take future classes.\"",

At first, it was super easy and enjoyable, with 5-question quizzes that were pretty straightforward. Duchaine and Wheatley kind of stabbed us in the back when they made the quizzes 15 questions in the same amount of time because the median was too high. The course became pretty stressful after that. I still love the lectures, but it's hard to really enjoy the class when you're writing down word-for-word what is said in the pre-recorded lectures. That being said, I still highly recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in psych.\"",

            "review 35: \"20F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: This class works very well in a remote structure and was super easy and very interesting. I saw a couple kids complain about this class or call it a little difficult, but it was a super easy A. We also didn't have a midterm or final so there was no additional stress for studying like other classes. While Professor Duchaine's lecture videos can be a little more hefty than Professor Wheatley's, all the lectures are still on intriguing topics and aren't boring by any means, but yeah Wheatley's lectures were really good. They are also both highly regarded in their fields so you are learning from some of the best. Wheatley's work is even referenced in the textbook on multiple occassions which was cool. The majority of the class is the quizzes, which are 60% of the grade. There are two quizzes a week and they are all based on the lecture videos that you watched. These quizzes are relatively easy as you're allowed to access your notes on the quiz, so as long as you take detailed notes on something like Google Docs, you can just look up the question in your document and use the professor's exact words for an answer. The only thing is you do have to answer about 10-12 questions in 30 minutes so you can't always give long winded responses and you have to work a little fast, but it's nothing extreme and super manageable. Also, your two lowest quiz grades are dropped at the end of the term so if you can't study for one or have something in the way, you don't even have to worry about it. The rest of the class is just homework which was even easier. The Inquizitives (which are 30% of the grade) are multiple choice questions based on the textbook (none of the textbook material is on any of the quizzes btw), and you can get as many questions wrong as you want, it will deduct points but you can just keep going till you get an ideal score. Honestly, you don't even have to read the textbook to answer them because you can search up key terms and find the answers, but the information was interesting so I chose to. Next, 5% comes from super these easy zap labs that are just a comprehensive 4 question multiple choice thing that you would have to try and get wrong. Then, the last 5% comes from article write-ups which is just reading some psychology articles and answering 5 or so questions. Some of these articles were a little more dense, but shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Additionally, if you do these extra credit experiments that they post throughout the term, you can get up to 16 points of extra credit (the class is out of 500 total points so its like 3.2% of a grade boost) and none take more than 45 minutes to do. For most of them you just sit on your computer and answer super simple questions or do easy tasks, it's nothing serious. I would highly recommend taking this class if you're interested in psychology and even if you're not, it is still an interesting class that almost guarantees you an A+ so it is worth your time.\"",

Once you get your hands on the psych textbook, you can work ahead as far out as you want to, reading chapters and completing online assessments where it's impossible not to get a perfect score (unless you turn in assignments late). The main body of your workload comes from that and the weekly quizzes based on the lectures. Type up what your instructors say in the lectures, to include the exposition they give about research studies, principles, and little stories they tell about themselves. Everything in the lectures can be included in the quizzes,and the questions get REALLY specific. I wouldn't call them unfair, but if you aren't a fast typer, having your notes pre-typed will allow you to copy-paste responses (all the questions are open-ended).

            "review 39: \"20F with Bradley Duchaine, Thalia Wheatley: The remote format for PSYC 1 was as follows: Monday interviews with professors, Wednesday/Friday \u201csections\u201d (35-minute small group discussions) with quizzes (30 minutes; 17 total, 15 counting toward the grade), weekly textbook quizzes (easy 100%), weekly ZAP assignments (short modules), and 5 article reviews. It was very easy to stay on top of your grade, but this came at the expense of an enjoyable learning experience. Covering 15 textbook chapters in 9 weeks means essentially zooming through the textbook as fast as you can in order to get to the quizzes. Each quiz was open-notes, but there were so many of them that eventually they became extremely taxing and monotonous to prepare for. Professor Duchaine\u2019s lectures were a pain to get through sometimes (not to mention his excessive focus on prosopagnosia, which is understandable given his research focus), especially because his external videos were not embedded in the lectures themselves. Professor Wheatley\u2019s lectures were significantly more interesting and engaging, and I enjoyed the weeks during which she posted videos more than those with Duchaine. Some of the lecture videos were quite long (exceeding 90 minutes), and because all of the quiz material came from the videos, it felt necessary to take notes on almost everything said in the videos, which extended the time commitment significantly. The Monday interviews were cool, but some of the enjoyment was sapped by the fact that I felt like I had to take notes on EVERYTHING in order to prepare for the quizzes (the interview material was included on at least one of the quizzes for that week). I was not a fan of \u201csection\u201d at all; while my undergrad TA kept the conversation going as best they could, I found that I gained essentially nothing from an awkward breakout room discussion. If you study for the quiz ahead of time, you will have no desire to contribute to the conversation and will essentially sit there until the quiz starts. Overall, PSYC 1 was a decent experience - I still enjoyed the class but was not as academically engaged as I could have been on campus (obviously).\"",

Lectures are incredibly engaging and interesting, and the profs know what they are doing! This course is about working smart... they will tell you to read/outline the textbook, which makes this class a heck of a lot more work than it needs to be. Textbook is rarely ever on the tests, but just in case I would read the end of chapter summaries and thats it. The course is 3 midterms and 1 final (all multiple choice) that are basically based solely on lectures. Attend class, pay attention, take good notes, and you will do fine. Ended with an A with these techniques. Overall my favorite class so far. Will definitely be taking more psychology classes in my future. Take this class!!!\"",

Looking back, if I had treated it like I should have, it wouldn't have been that hard to get an A-. The online textbook quizzes were really helpful, but I think taking better lecture notes would've been useful too. Duchaine and Wheatley were a good combo, and I always found their lectures really interesting.\""

It didn't seem like lectures were that important. However, they were interesting to attend since the professors specialized in the field of psychology that they lectured on and seemed to get excited about the subject (like one professor lectured only on developmental psych, another only on cognitive psych, etc.). The tests were all multiple choice, so that was a plus. Also, there is ample opportunity for extra credit through simple labs. Most of the time you just sit there and hit a button for half an hour. Easy points.\"",

The exams are multiple choice, which works for some and not others, but there's a lot of practice stuff out there-- mainly people's old exams and the book's website.

            "review 3: \"05W with Ann Clark: Psych 1 is a lot of fun! Four profs taught this course: Ann Clarke (neurobiology and abnormal psych), Russell Hughes (learning, sensory processes, perception, and cognition), Todd Heatherton (developmental and personality psych), and Robert Kleck (social psych). All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology. There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy). The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals. The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully. Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so. This converts the exam median grade of B-/B into a final median grade of B or B+. Take this class! You'll love it!\"",
            "review 4: \"04F with William Kelley: I highly recommend this class. Readings are interesting, and William Kelley is hilarious. If you pay attention during lectures and get a hold of the concepts in the text, you should be fine. Attending class is important, especially in the social psychology section. Tests are multiple-choice, and most of the questions are roughly the same as those in the study guide. Todd Heatherton is good too, but Ann Clark and Yale Cohen were uninspiring.\"",
            "review 5: \"04F with William Kelley: This class was really not taught by just Prof. Kelley (he's the chair of the course). This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different. Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies. Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though. Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either). Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland. I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material. Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.\"",
            "review 6: \"03S with Todd Heatherton: I originally took this course because I knew a few people who had taken it and I wanted an easy course. It turned out to be maybe my hardest course of the term. This class is known as a gut, but it is not. The material is not too difficult, but there is too much of it. This course attempts to cover all of psychology during the course of one term, an impossible task. The main problem with this course is that you are responsible for an incredible amount of information on the tests. Some of the questions asked go into great detail, so you really need to memorize the book. We cover pretty much the whole textbook, and each test is on about four chapters, which is too much information for one test. The course has four sections, each with a different teacher and test, then a final. There are also \"t-point\" experiments which can be done for extra credit. However, these experiments, combined with the memorization required, make this course extremely time-consuming. This said, the course material is extremely interesting. Altogether, I would reccomend this course if you are a potential psych major or very interested in psychology, but not if you want a gut, because there is a very high workload.\"",

            "review 8: \"03S with Todd Heatherton: The reading for this class, I thought, was pretty interesting. The prof's just basically regurgitate whatever is in the text. The way it was run when I took it, the tests were 75% from the book and 25% from lectures. SO basically, you just had to read everything in the book. not that bad actually...if you're interested in psych. it's not that hard to get A/A-.\""

The tests are all multiple choice and some questions can be ambiguous, but there's nothing you can do about that. Wheatley and Wager each teach about half of the lectures. Go to Wheatley's lectures -- they are engaging, interesting, and worth it. Don't go to Wager's lectures. He tries, but he's pretty boring and won't shut up about his own research.\"",

This class also takes a lot of work; I'd be spending a good few hours taking notes on each chapter (usually like 2 a week) on top of some additional time to complete the Inquizitive homeworks. Also, doing the T point studies for extra credit definitely helps and can sometimes be quite interesting, so this is also another additional time investment for the class.

I took this class because I had heard great things, and thought that learning some psychology would be cool, but boy was I mistaken. The structure of the class is ridiculous, as they give you lecture videos that exceed the time that would fit into the class period, then you have to meet in pointless TA sections during the normal class time, and ALSO listen to an interview on Mondays where the professors just yuck it up with the interviewee while the class sits there. BUT you have to pay attention because you are tested on the interview! Wager's lectures are super boring and long, while Wheatley's are actually not too bad. They expect you to ALSO read the textbook in addition to all of the other stuff, and the main exams are more focussed on the book. So why make us watch all of these ridiculous lectures?! The TAs are clueless and the tests and quizzes are purposely made exceedingly difficult (as evident by the C medians). Oh, and don't even get me started on the other pointless assignments like article write-ups and data assignments. You learn 0 and have to dedicate valuable time to pointless activities. I wish I never took this class, and wasted an NRO because I didn't want this class (that I was taking for fun and to be adventurous) to kill my GPA. As long as these profs are teaching and the class is structured the way it is (online), STAY AWAY!\"",

I thought that Wheatley's stuff was really interesting, Wager's work is really cool but his presentations were really long and boring imo. Online, they added a bunch of pointless activities and the lectures were a lot longer than they would have been if we had synchronous stuff. The medians for the individual portion of the exam was 80% and the group portions were around a 93% usually. Definitely do the Tpoints early in the course, they can bump you up to half a letter grade. Overall, if you need to take this class, try to do it in person because I think it would be more interesting and engaging.\"",
            "review 7: \"21S with Thalia Wheatley, Tor Wager: This class was NOT a layup unless you are able to keep up with all the textbook readings and watch all the lectures. I would say that both Wheatley and Wagers' lecture videos were really interesting, though Professor Wager's lectures could be extensively long at times, and they are harder to get through than Prof. Wheatley's. I would not say that this class is horrible though, because it is an intro class it covers a lot of ground in the psych field very quickly, but some topics are more interesting than others. Studying is required so reading the textbook is not enough, know what terms mean and how to apply them to different scenarios/circumstances. Not too bad of a class, considering it was remote.\"",

Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT take this class with Wager, he is the worst, and the class format DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. He goes on long, boring tangents that go on and on and on. Wheatley\u2019s lectures were significantly better... I actually enjoyed watching them. Most significantly, the structure of the online class was TERRIBLE \u2014 tests with a C median, all multiple choice. Instead of having actual lectures during class time, the TAs would just sort us into breakout rooms during section and we\u2019d sit there in silence. The exams just covered the textbook, so it felt very detached and much like a self study/transcribe and repeat kind of course. For an introductory course on psychology, it could have been taught 1000% better in a different format. I am a firm believer that Intro classes should ENCOURAGE people to pursue the subject, not dread it. I really wish the profs were more receptive to student advice/feedback over the term. I went through pain (and I mean, actually physical pain \u2014 went into an MRI and got shocked by electrodes) to finish this class, so be warned. I\u2019d give it a 2/10.\"",
