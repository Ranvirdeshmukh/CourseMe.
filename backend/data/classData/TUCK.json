            "review 1: \"22S with Christian Stadler: Completely disagree with the 21S reviews, probably because this course was taught in-person this term. Stadler was an excellent professor who showed up to class everyday radiating energy. He made the class as fun and engaging as possible. The material taught is dry during some portions of the course but I found it, overall, to be an extremely informative class. My only complaint is the final project/small group presentation requirements are slightly unclear. However, this leaves a lot of room for you to get creative with it. If you're looking for a class with little work, take this. There are daily reading assignments which take maybe 15 min to do (which you can easily do before or during class). Only assignments are a first draft presentation with your small group, a final slide deck submission and a final exam consisting of 3 case study questions. Very manageable workload and a great professor. If you are interested in learning about consulting, try this class out.\"",

As a FGLI POC student I found the class to be accessible and the professor approachable. He is a great ally and honestly a great listener. The atmosphere is mostly male-dominated, but I would recommend not to be afraid of participating and using your voice. The class content includes globally sourced case studies and different ways of viewing business strategy. There really is no wrong answer, it is just a matter of effort and quality of work. That being said a huge chunk of your grade is participation (so don't be afraid to participate otherwise.......he will call on you lol) the other is the slides which is a group project.\"",

His lectures are awful and poorly planned, as much as he pretends to be a good professor. A big chunk of your grade is participation and attendance (30%) which was stupid given the remote setting and radically different time zones. Fucking useless group presentation that didn't properly represent the class material. He never gave students at least a 5-min break, even though this class was from 10:20 am - 12:10 pm. Given he contributes to a small section on Forbes, he loves to brag about how he engages with the magazine and his shitty, \"compelling\" strategy columns. His utterly strong Austrian accent made class difficult to comprehend and forbade students to offer more than two comments during class. He ensured that even the most deserving students of a high participation grade received an A- because they did not have their cameras on for the class period. I love business and the corporate world, but this stupid professor made a rather simple and interesting subject turn into an awful class. I truly hope the Tuck folks read my course assessment and fire him from Dartmouth, or limit him to write useless content on Forbes. Also, he will love to brag that his wife is from Kenya. No one cares!!! I highly encourage you not to take this course with him and learn the material by yourself.\""

I think in general business classes are not useful unless you are about to take a business role in a medium to large company. But at least the class had little work. The only homework we ever had was to read an HBS ~12pg case study before each class. Hence the class involved ~5-6 hours work per week. Prof. Andrew King was ok, although not a great explainer. His classes were typically very disorganized. In class he would ask us discussion questions about the cases that were posted on Canvas with the cases. He would then raise our hands (occasionally he cold called) and he would take points from various students and put them on board. He tried to keep classes structured, but they often weren\u2019t. Our grade was determined entirely by class participation, and midterm and final scores. We had little idea what would be on midterm and final until close to the exams, and even then with no other graded assignments, it was uncertain how the exams would be graded. As of 2018W there is no way to NRO this class. As of yet I do not know my grade in the class, and I don\u2019t have a good idea of what it will be. Final was also take-home, so there may have been considerable cheating. I\u2019ve had other classes that had take home exams at Dartmouth and from what I gather a number of students cheated. I would not recommend this class unless you do not care much about your GPA and want a layup not likely to be particularly useful.\""

Grewal can be annoying and tries too hard to be cool and relatable but is nice enough. Marketing, especially how Grewal teaches it, is super super boring . She just spits out boring definitions and made up frameworks or processes broken out into arbitrary steps and then you memorize them off the slides for the final. It's all stuff that there is no reason to memorize made up terms for because you'd understand the same idea from just common sense. It's pointless. Kind of (actually fully) the opposite of the type of learning that teaches you anything about the real world (which is lame for a Tuck class) and also has none of the cool or interesting parts of regular Dartmouth classes. I would not take this class. You won't get anything out of it, so if you want to take an easy class then go find some fun liberal arts class with a cool topic and cool professors.

            "review 4: \"22F with Conwell Worthington: Where do I even begin with Professor Worthlesston's class? This class turned out to be my least favorite class that I have taken at Dartmouth. First, Prof Worthington taught straight out of the textbook and any extra examples he did provide were always related to sports (NHL, Nike, etc.). When a student brought up this point about how his examples were catered towards a subset of the class (i.e. domestic students & athletes), he told the class that the onus should be on us to bring diverse examples to the conversation. Excuse me?? Second, the format of the quizzes and final was awful. The quizzes were 5 questions, 35 minutes total. Each question was a short-answer response, except that most questions actually contained more than one question. As a result, I ended up writing at least 800 words per quiz and never had time to double check my answers. Worthington seemed to think that this format was completely doable--easy for him to say when he already had the answers in mind while writing the questions--because despite numerous complaints from students, he did not change the format. He was also extremely nitpicky in his grading and would randomly dock points for things that we failed to include in our answers even though he never asked about them in the original question. This nitpicky grading also applied to the two group projects as well, with the maximum score on the first project being a 93. Also sidenote -- he had this dumb policy where you had to meet in-person to see your grades, so people would often be waiting 15-20 minutes after class to check their grade. Lastly, the worst part of this class was PARTICIPATION. Every day he graded us on scale of 1 to 5 on participation, and to get some sort of an A grade you had to speak at least twice per class (and one word answers don't count). This would've been doable had the class been 25-30 people, but keep in mind that each section was 60 people. As a result, it felt like a competition to get one's participation points in, and the quality of contributions was quite poor. So TLDR -- don't waste your time with this class. The material is so easy it could be taught to a fifth grader but Prof Worthington is one of the most incompetent, difficult, and problematic professors I've had at Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 5: \"22F with Conwell Worthington: Conwell was an interesting professor who encouraged students to engage with the material. While participation is key, the questions are not hard and most were just observations students made about how something made them feel. Not a hard class or time consuming.\"",
            "review 6: \"22F with Conwell Worthington: While this class was much harder than anticipated, I thought TUCK 2 with Professor Worthington was not as bad in the end. You didn't need to do the readings because the slides he provided had everything before class. The participation is mostly being creative and learning how to make an informed opinion on your feet. Make sure your marketing campaign and project is a cool company and fascinating to you, and talk to him outside of class A LOT (office hours, after class, before class, during class). He will see you care about the class and this will influence your final grade positively if you keep at it. He had interesting case studies but sometimes it felt like the students had to run the whole class rather than him. His lectures were very engaging and he would cold call frequently, so be aware. But, this class challenged me and took me outside my comfort zone with material that is interesting and kind of easy. Quizzes and tests were all essay based, except for some MC on the final.\""

If you keep up with the homework and go to TA office hours when you're having trouble, you'll probably be fine on the midterm and final. Professor: Professor Resutek is great--he really knows his stuff and does a good job teaching the material. He realizes that everyone NROs the class, so he definitely tries to make it manageable. He even offers an alternative final exam for people struggling with the class that only focuses on the first 4 weeks of material (if you take the alternative final, your maximum grade is a C+ in the class, so the NRO kicks in). That being said, if you stick with it and do the work, you should do ok in the class. Workload: The weekly homework is difficult, but you get full credit as long as you put some effort into it. You really need to do the homework to understand the material though. And you probably don't need to read the textbook as long as you're trying the practice material that Professor Resutek provides. The midterm and final make up 30 and 40 percent of your grade, respectively. The rest is homework, class participation, and quizzes.\"",
            "review 2: \"12W with Robert Resutek: Course: Solid course, but definitely NRO it! It's nice to have the option of taking the NR if all of your other classes are out of control during finals. Learned a lot about basic accounting. Professor: Really nice guy. Super understanding. He does a nice job with material which can be super dry. Workload: Definitely manageable. You can mess up the homeworks and still get full credit as long as you showed some effort.\""
