Prof. Kassler Taub did a really great job of easing us into it, and the material was pretty interesting most of the time. Workload is not bad at all: readings for each class (which you can skim), a discussion post due at the end of each week, a short paper, midterm, and longer final paper. Classes were mostly lecture with some discussion thrown in. Prof. Kassler Taub is super nice and definitely wants what's best for her students. We visited Rauner and the Hood a few times and I thought those were the most interesting classes. I'm glad I took this class, but art history is just not for me.\"",

The class had a discussion post every week (not bad at all, it was hardly even a paragraph), a midterm, and a final research paper. I think Taub overall did a good job and is super willing to help and engage. She is a germ-a-phob! She wore a KN-95 every day, and would be sure everyone in the front row of the class (closest to her) was wearing a mask properly. And she changed her office hours to Zoom, which wasn't a huge deal, but just good to know. Overall, would recommend. Not super hard, but the research paper at the end is slightly long. Really fascinating topic and not a ton of work.\"",

More laid back however than general NJ population. I don't think she is a germaphobe but rather wants to follow college policies for compliance reasons. Research paper is only 10 pages. Weekly readings were dense and mostly technical. Discussion posts and peer responses were the most annoying because almost everybody was late on those.

Professor Kassler-Taub is such a well-spoken, engaging lecturer and also a really kind, relatable human being!

Most of the people in my class were art history or studio art majors and minors, but I had zero background and loved it anyways. The reading load is manageable (30-70 pages per class), and while the homework should be thoughtfully completed to get a good grade, it's only collected roughly every other week.

Ironically, I ended up having to take a class with him for the MES minor and that was the worst class I have ever taken. Elias is cruel and should not be teaching at this school.

Workload wasn't too bad, but I found it a bit difficult to write about the subjects with respect to art since this was only the second art history class I've taken. We had weekly group discussion posts, 6 precis assignments which are 500-700 word responses to a prompt related to a topic we discussed in class that week, a take home midterm, and a final paper. Weekly reading assignments as well, which helped with lecture and discussion, would recommend doing them and they're not that bad Professor Elias is a fair grader, super friendly, and helpful in office hours. Make sure to take notes of points people bring up in discussions, because you're allowed to incorporate stuff discussed in lecture/discussions into your precis assignments and discussion posts (just make sure to add your own input and points).

The material was super interesting: the structures we looked at were visually breathtaking, but I also appreciated the chance to learn about Islamic history, dynasty progression, as well as societies and cultures. The assessments in 21X consisted of weekly quizzes, two exams, and a 250-word paragraph on a building. The typical workload was manageable and mainly consisted of completing the readings and quizzes. Preparation before exams was intensive, as the course is content-heavy. The 250-word paragraph is also more rigorous than it sounds, as Camerlenghi is very meticulous; that said, he also allows you to submit multiple drafts and is always available to meet with you outside of class to provide insightful feedback \u2014 a reasonable trade-off, in my opinion.

He's *gasp* a real human being who actually cares about his students. But in all seriousness... this class is easy, but you get out of it what you put into it. The class is composed of reading responses (due before each class starts), a midterm (3 pages), a research paper (4 pages... or was it 6?), and a final (3-4 pages). You can put as much or as little effort into these and do well in his class either way. Professor Hockley's lectures cover all the necessary material to get a good grade in the class, but if you do his readings and actively write his assignments, you really really will learn something in this class. In sum: Low stress, interesting material, high reward. TAKE IT!\""

If you want a prof that will structure 10 weeks of difficult coursework and crack the whip of New England academia, this is not your class. It was the most laid-back art history class I've taken. We had four sessions viewing private works at the Hood as well. The structure was 4 quizzes based on memorization, and you get to drop one. You don't really need to do the readings either.

The class was very unstructured, as she would show up late for exams and start every class late too. She rushes through the slides that you actually need to know for the exam and spends way too much time on unnecessary information.

The format is that you are given a picture of a building and you need to identify the name, architect, date, etc. then talk about the building's historical and cultural context. Pretty straightforward but you are on a time crunch and if you forget the building it really messes the whole answer up. She'll never ask anything super niche, though.

Heck's exams are an unfair evaluation of the student's knowledge on the subject. There is no reason in this day and age that memorization of dates should count as 10% or more of your grade on an exam. There's also no reason that she should expect complete essays that demonstrate the student's knowledge of the subject to be written in ten minutes flat. It's ludicrous!

Exams test almost solely your ability to recall as much of the relelvant lectures as possible in a small amount of time. Professor Heck does warn you that lectures will be much more important than reading in her class, but the texts--particularly the one covering 20th century architecture --are excellent and should be better incorporated into the class.

There are three tests - mostly essay-type questions - and one paper, only 5 pages. the tests themselves are actually relatively demanding, because Heck writes up deceptively easy tests. If you have attended lecture and looked over your notes hurriedly in a slapdash way, you will NOT do well on tests. For most of the tests, the average grade was an 81, or thereabouts. she is a stickler for detail, and the tests are graded rather pickily. The paper gives you two options from which to choose, and they are both relatively easy; in fact, she preferred that they be more like op-eds than actual research papers. Heck is delightful, really pleasant, and very funny in her own way. she is an effective lecturer, even though her voice is very soft and cute... once you get through the first test, you know you'll have to listen pretty well.

The four papers are a nice length (one 2-page paper, two 3-page papers, and one 4-page paper), and for the midterm and final she provides a slide list narrowing down the possibilities for slides on the exams (I have heard that other Art History professors just expect you to learn every slide you look at during the term, so I really appreciated this).

I never took an art course before this term, my senior fall, much less an art history course. so i was a bit wary of taking a course numbered 50 especially after the friend who joined the class with me dropped out. This was confirmed after doing not so well on the first essay where i basically didn't know what a formal analysis was (you'll learn quite easily if you take the time to listen which i then did). Following that, however, prof. coffey gave us ample chances to revise and improve our writing content and style. By the end, i was suprisingly confident in analyzing and appreciating new art pieces when just 10 weeks before i would make jokes about how I was going to fail out of senior fall because of an art class after surviving the oh so lovable world of biochem for three years. The only drawback would be the constant stream of essays to do (4 in total + 2 exams). however, when you realize doing every bit of reading or even any when you're really busy isn't actually necessary, the course becomes a cake walk and instructional seminar in the more important applications of technical analysis and discussion. In short, if like me, you're winding down time and looking for an art distrib that will spur interest in area you won't have time to ever explore again, take this course and you won't be disappointed.\"",

However, Professor Coffey gives a lot of feedback on these papers and lets students rewrite them. To get a decent grade in this class, expect to attend mostly every lecture (and x-hour) and do the reading.

The readings were very engaging, as was the prof during class lectures. However, I found his attitude towards the students, and towards our obligations as students, to be very disconcerting. He claimed to be a proponent of the \"socratic method,\" which I assumed to mean that we would spend a great deal of class time debating various points covered in our readings. Not so. He merely expected us to regurgitate whatever our readings said, mainly as a means to prove that we did in fact do the reading. If we did not remember all of the most pertinent facts about the reading, he would talk down to us as though we had not done a thorough enough job with our assigned homework. This was very disappointing to me, as it allowed no room for us to flex our creative muscles, or to offer interpretations of our own in class. The term paper and exams were fine. We had one midterm and final exam, and a 10-20 page term paper. I found the paper to be interesting, and it allowed me to learn a great deal about one particular artist. The exams were okay, but *beware* -- McGrath has a tendency to \"accidentally\" put slides on his exams that were never up on artemisia, nor discussed in class. In fact, our only exposure to them was in the reading. DO THE READING. All in all, a really interesting class, with great lectures and readings, all on some fantastic art. But the professor was annoyingly pretentious, and he didn't really seem to care about helping his students to explore the material.\"",

When I blitzed Prof. McGrath prior to enrolling I asked about the work load--he described the course as \"no walk in the park, but not overly difficult.\" I thought that was a pretty ambiguous way of evaluating the course, but I'd have to agree with him. The class consists of a midterm exam, a research paper, and a final exam; other than the paper, the only work outside the classroom was the reading. Some of it was quite interesting, but there were a few selections that definitely put me to sleep. During class, Prof. McGrath likes to call on students randomly and ask questions about the reading--cruel, but effective, and McGrath is certainly enthusiastic enough about the subjects he discusses to make the student want to participate on some sort of informed level. Overall, I enjoyed the class and think both non-majors and those considering specializing in Art History will get something out of it.\""

Fundamentally, it was a 2-hour lecture stuck in a room watching slides of *minor* artists 90% of the time. The names all ran together, and the exams were *more* likely to ask for full identification of minor/not covered works rather than *less*. It wasn't 100% hellish, of course.

As far as the class goes, sometimes you dont really pick up on what the important points are, due to his insane amount of attention to student questions. So you have to hit the readings hard to pick up on concepts you may have not realized were important in class.

Initially, I was worried that my lack of art history experience would put me at a disadvantage; however, roughly half of the class also did not have any art background, and Professor Camerlenghi taught the class in a way that was accessible to everyone. The material was super interesting: the structures we looked at were visually breathtaking, but I also appreciated the chance to learn about Islamic history, dynasty progression, as well as societies and cultures. The assessments in 21X consisted of weekly quizzes, two exams, and a 250-word paragraph on a building. The typical workload was manageable and mainly consisted of completing the readings and quizzes. Preparation before exams was intensive, as the course is content-heavy. The 250-word paragraph is also more rigorous than it sounds, as Camerlenghi is very meticulous; that said, he also allows you to submit multiple drafts and is always available to meet with you outside of class to provide insightful feedback \u2014 a reasonable trade-off, in my opinion.

As for assignments, the reading is very manageable (some would say not required) and he doesn't use his x-hour. Realistically, there are only three grades for the term: midterm, final, and research paper. For the exams, you have to do a lot of memorization, flashcards are a must. Although it is a lot to know, and in my opinion way too little time to take the exam, Kangas does let you know exactly what you need to know well before the exam. The research paper is much easier, only 6-7 pages on some item in the MFA Boston after the class trip there.

The midterm and final are straight from memorization, though there is quite a lot to memorize. But as long as you are thorough in your descriptions on your exams, you should be okay. The format is 10 art pieces, where you have 3 minutes to describe each one. Then you have 10 minutes to compare/contrast two art pieces that he gives you. Just write fast, it's quite time constraining. Good thing that the final is non-cumulative! There is one research paper about 8-9 pages on an artwork that he gives you a couple choices for, and you just have to dig in to information you can find about it. Took a lot of work, in my opinion, but that's the general thing for any research paper. Professor: Kangas clearly knows what he's talking about, though the class can get boring since it's mostly made of the same format at every lecture. He's kind of an awkward guy, but helpful if you go talk to him about the research paper. Workload: There are readings everyday, but you don't have to do them at all. He assigns partners to present some of the readings, and assigns enough so everyone will present once during the term, but besides that you don't need to follow on the readings.

If you've never taken an art history class before, you'll be pretty psyched about learning this stuff, which is pretty cool at first.... almost like going to a museum while listening to an audio-guide. Personally, I love going to art museums, so I was enjoying myself. This euphoria lasts for about 5-7 classes. Then the midterm rolls around, and you realize that you will have to memorize a BUTTLOAD of information. You might be saying to yourself, \"Well, that's okay, I'm good at memorization.\" Unfortunately, nothing will prepare you for the cerebral rape you are about to undergo. Before the midterm, there will be around 12 classes. Each class, you look at approximately 20-25 slides. For each slide, you usually have to memorize about 4-5 important facts. Put it all together, and that is a BUTTLOAD OF MEMORIZATION. You can do the math. After the midterm, you start to realize that looking at slide after slide after slide is not nearly as interesting as it was in the beginning. Unlike other art history courses, ancient Greek art does not really undergo that many monumental changes throughout its development. It gets very repetitive. In fact, just when you get up to the beautiful white-washed marble statues that you may have seen in the Metropolital Museum of Art, you're practically at the end of the course. Then there's the final. Same deal as the midterm, except there's less time to prepare. And Prof. Cohen is not an easy grader. Somewhere in the second half, there is an enormous research paper on the topic of your choice. Depending on the topic that you choose, this can actually be an interesting assignment. But again, watch out for her grading... make sure you end with a good point. In general, Ada Cohen is a very nice woman. A little awkward face-to-face, but quite amiable nonetheless. Other than that, she is not particularly interesting during lectures. As I said, once you start to lose interest in the material, you will soon realize that the Prof has not been the one inspiring that interest. I suppose ancient greek art fanatics and art history majors might enjoy the course a bit more than i did. But I do enjoy ancient art and sculptures more than the average person, and I can say that this course is not as great as it's made out to be. Hope you take this review seriously!\""

Despite the fact that it's a course about Egyptian Art, really the Near Eastern art takes precedence with Kangas; he will spend the majority of class time discussing the Mesopotamians, which is really just as interesting, and, unlike with Egypt, one cannot just pick up a book about Mesopotamia and learn what he teaches in the course. The major assignment, a short paper on the Assyrian Reliefs at Dartmouth, was fun, interesting, and relevent.

Certainly not boring, although slightly unfocused. Still, he presents all the material in an easily comprehensible manner.

Kangas is pretty soft-spoken so his lectures aren't as riveting as they could be if he was more dynamic, but he is a very interesting professor and a good lecturer. The material was very interesting, it was great to learn about the Near East and especially Ancient Egypt. I took this class both to fulfill my Non-Western distrib and to fufill the ancient requirement of my art history minor. The readings are essentially supplemental, although they were somewhat helpful in studying for the exams, but really all you need to do is go to the classes, listen to what he says, take good notes and you're good to go for the paper (5-6 pages) and 2 exams. The final was non-cumulative (great!) and I ended up doing very well in this class.

            "review 16: \"05W with Joy Kenseth: I was just a regular ol' unsuspecting Dartmouth student, looking through the ORC trying to find a third class and perhaps fill a distrib when I stumbled upon Art History 2. Taking the class seemed like a great idea at the time: get my art requirement out of the way and pick up some much needed culture (in other words, learn how to impress girls in museums) at the same time. Sign me up, I thought. Oh boy. The class was nothing like what I expected. First off, it was loads of work. I'm considering being an econ or a govy major, and so I was taking a class in each of those subjects at the same time, yet somehow I spent more time on art history than I did on either of those two classes. How, you ask? Because, as I found out, art history is about so much more than slide memorization. On the exams we were required not only to know the name, date (within a few years), artist, style, and origin of any work that happened to be shown, but also to write intelligently and answer a question about said work. Sometimes we were required to compare and contrast two works, other times we were shown one work at a time, and (here's the kicker) sometimes we were shown works that we had never seen before the exam and told to do our best to make some sense of them. I'm sure that this is all fun and games if you're a potential art history major, however, I certainly am not. For me, it amounted to fun and games plus many hours in the 1902 Room learning a plethora of information about at least 150-200 works per exam. Unfortunately, some studying inevitably goes for naught due to the incredibly fickle grading system that is apparently used in art history courses. I know that subjective grading is considered par for the course in the humanities, but art history takes it to a whole new level. If you want to get a grade in the A range, my advice to you is to remember what adjectives the professors use in class to describe the pieces of art, and then use those exact same adjectives on the exam. On one of my responses on the midterm, the word \"flawless\" in my answer was crossed out by the grader and \"perfect\" was written in its place. Now, I've lived on Earth for 18 years thinking that those two words were perfect synonyms. Or is it flawless synonyms? The professors in this course weren't oustanding, either. Professor Kenseth was clearly the better of the two, and I actually managed to stay awake in every one of her lectures - she's a very animated presenter and brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the class. Professor Coffey, on the other hand, failed to bring much life to the material. She also had a penchant for making up words as she went along, my favorite being \"racialized\" - which I have never heard before nor since, and still haven't the slightest clue what it means. The bottom line on the class is this: it's harder than you'll expect it to be if you've never taken art history before, it's an intro class with a boatload of likely art history majors chomping at the bit to display their superior knowledge, and there are much easier ways to obtain your ART requirement. So, should you take it? Personally, despite all of the bad-mouthing that I've given to ARTH 2, I'm glad that I managed to sit through it. I definitely learned a good bit of art history, and it should stick with me after hours upon hours of slide memorization. If nothing else, I feel that I could now walk into the Met and have a clue about the art on the walls. If you want some culture and don't mind doing a little work to get it, ARTH 2 may be for you, but don't be like me - know what you're getting yourself into.\"",

Tests require a fair amount of memorization, but for essay questions, they were pretty good about asking you to write about stuff they'd discussed in depth in class. Not nearly as scary as I'd thought it would be, but it does require you to set aside time to study. The grade comes from a midterm and a final (not cumulative) and a paper. The tests weren't bad. The paper was kind of annoying, but not too hard. Definitely didn't inspire any deep passion in me, but I'm glad I took this class.

I feel much more educated being familiar with art from the 1500s all the way to the present, and I'm sure you will, too.

            "review 2: \"21W with Elizabeth Kassler-taub And Mary Coffey: This class was a lot of work. It was largely asynchronous, so on top of the weekly group assignment, individual essay, and occasional third project, there were also 2-3 video lectures to watch, which were often very long. That being said, EKT and MKC are very kind and invested in the success of their students. They offered opportunities for extra credit and ways to boost your grade and valued student feedback a lot. I didn't take notes on the lectures and still felt like I gained something from the class and was able to do well. Ultimately, having the multitude of smaller assignments felt a bit overwhelming in the moment but it was kinda nice to not have a midterm. While this is by no means a layup, it was manageable, and is worth it if you're interested.\""

            "review 1: \"09F with Kathleen Corrigan: I took this class because i fell in love with art history in high school and thought that i could potentially major in it. I definitely regret taking this class because i am now definitely NOT majoring in art history. The class started out ok when Cohen did all the lectures from the Prehistoric period to the Roman period. Her lectures were all right not too bad and not amazing. I definitely understood what she was talking about and how it's relevant to the course though. She didn't do a very good job covering the overarching themes of the different periods though. Her midterm was ok. It was definitely a lot of memorizing of foreign names and places. The worst part were the dates. If you study and memorize for a week you should be fine for the midterm. If you have time, make flashcards. I thought that would have been useful when i was cramming for the midterm. THEN...... Corrigan stepped in halfway through the term to talk about Medieval art which is already boring to begin with. I was so grossly shocked by how unorganized and irrelevant most of the things she said were. She literally would drone on about some tiny detail that you know won't be on the final so she's just wasting your time. She doesn't talk about the significance of any of the art pieces and doesn't lecture about what makes a piece byzantine or romanesque so you kind of have to piece that together by yourself. I just started bring my book to class (which i didn't have to read for cohen's part of the term) and reading it instead of listening to her. I don't know if this is partly because i don't like medieval art but she definitely was a boring professor and made me hate medieval art more. She also didn't name or date any of powerpoints she posted on blackboard so when studying time came around it took FOREVER just to figure out from my notes which icon or church was which. She also skipped around the outline of pieces during her \"lectures\" which made identifying the slides even more confusing and difficult when i was trying to study. I decided to not major in art history because of her. I was scared that i might have to take another course taught by her which would be horrible. I've literally never had such an unclear,unorganized, and boring instructor in my life. We had a comparison paper in the middle of the term which wasn't a big deal. I thought the final was pretty hard but if you studied hard you would do fine. I had so much trouble with the dates and period in slide ids because Corrigan never taught us how to distinguish churches and scrolls from each other.... If you're really interested in art history, you should AVOID this one and take an upper level one that concentrates on a period that you like. Otherwise, there are so many WAY more interesting courses you can take in other departments. The good thing about this class was that the only time i had to do work was the week prior to the final and the midterm. Otherwise i never touched my notebook outside of class.\"",
            "review 2: \"09F with Kathleen Corrigan: If you need to take this class, please think it through. There are LOTS of other really great (EASY! fun!) classes to take to fulfill the Art distributive requirement, even within the Art History department. This is not one of them. Plus, it uses its x-hour. Let me remind you that the artwork shown is PREHISTORIC to MEDIEVAL. No one finds that exciting. People majoring in art history don't love this class. Even if you think you like art, you won't find the pieces they lecture about interesting. I'm so serious. Literally, cave paintings and random Christian enameled little votive statues come to mind when I think about this class. EASINESS: The people who told me this \"course was so easy!\" and that I'd \"definitely get an A on Cohen's half of the term\" were wrong. It's actually 105 slides. For the midterm. If you're good at memorizing the images, you still won't necessarily do well. You need to stay awake long enough to actually comprehend and memorize what Corrigan and Cohen are saying about each image because they expect EACH little sentence about any 10 of the 105 images per test, and will take off for every little bullet point you miss. Luckily there are only TWO tests (midterm and final). However, 210 slides about cave paintings and early christian artwork really just blows. Just try memorizing all the dates you need to know just to get basic credit, and tell me if this class is still the easy, dreamy blowoff you want to take. FUNNESS: Again, this is a course about artwork that no one actually remembers, short of maybe 5 or 6 pieces that you are better off learning from \"The Annotated Mona Lisa\" by Carol Strickland. If you want to learn more about ancient art, than take a class that will actually EXPLORE it. Instead, Ancient Art is lumped into 5 weeks where Cohen rushes through prehistoric to late Greek. And nobody finds Corrigan's foray into early medieval architecture interesting, even though she is clearer and more straightforward about the notes than Cohen is. INTENSITY: As I said, this course, uses it's X-hour. Why does it need one? Show up to these because they take attendance here. So, to recap, we you'll have to go to class 4 times (with the x-hour) a week to memorize the lectures you'll have to spit up later for the 2 tests that span (literally) 67,000 years (not even kidding) and 210 images (are you serious), and write a 5-page comparative essay, going into great depth about the artwork. If that's your thing, you're fine, but, REALLY, is this really ANYONE'S thing? GRADES: Being an art history class, this course isn't NRO-able. I was okay with my final grade (not thrilled) despite working much, much harder than I should have had to for an \"easy\" class. Grading for the whole term is also semi-subjective with regard to how well you get to know both professors, so if you DO have to take this class, make sure to talk to them early and often. This course made me and several other students convinced not to touch the art history department again. I only wish that I had dropped it within the range of dates permitted by the registrar instead of toughing it out.\"",
            "review 3: \"09F with Kathleen Corrigan: I really enjoyed and benefited from taking this class. As the other reviews mentioned, the grade is composed of a midterm, a paper, and a final. Since there are no other formal assignments, you essentially have the entire term to prepare for the two exams. The paper was also very manageable; it was only five pages and we had three weeks to work on it. Overall, I learned a lot in this class and plan to take more art history courses in the future.\"",

It was extremely interesting and I learned a lot more than expected. There is a lot of memorization involved in studying for the tests, but week to week the readings aren't too bad. Definitely do the reading though, as it reinforces a lot of what the professors teach and provides a bit of extra background. As far as the exams go, note cards were key for me, one for each piece of art. There are a lot that way, but it helps a ton. Just remember to study in sections, breaking the note cards down by period to memorize.\"",

            "review 9: \"07F with Kathleen Corrigan: While I find Art History interesting in the abstract, this intro class really killed any entusiasm I might have had for the subject. I think it's mostly the format in which it's taught- it really needs to move into the 21st century, because when you can Google Image everything we see in class, there must be some other way to learn about it than in a lecture hall looking at slides. The one essay we wrote for class was the most creative and intellectual thing all term, and I would suggest that in stead of two big tests and an essay, a series of shirt in-class essays about different art peices be the method of evaluation instead. That would encourage people to come to class (it's not neccesary) and also be a lot more interesting to read different persepctives about the art.\"",

Kangas) to be good lecturers, but the class is pretty predictable and not that thrilling.

            "review 14: \"07F with Kathleen Corrigan: I'm a major, and I found this class incredibly easy even though I literally spent no time reviewing outside class. I didn't do any of the reading. I didn't even know any of the dates of the art and architecture on the final exam, and I still got an A in the class. How is this possible? Don't ask me. I think this class was much easier on average-- yes, there's a lot of memorization, but I'm proof that even if you don't do some of that memorization, you can still come out on top. In general, I am very interested in the periods this class covered, from Ancient Mesopotamia to Medieval Europe, so I had a bit of an advantage in that I had already covered most of the material in my other Art History classes. That said, I found the first half of the class, about Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece to be FAR more interesting than the latter half that Corrigan taught. Why? Kangas is a much better lecturer. It's true, neither of them are exactly charismatic but if you can get over Kangas's monotone voice, he actually has a very interesting perspective as an Art Historian-- not to mention a wry sense of humor. The two professors were concerned with different things-- Kangas was more interested in the 'bigger picture' and the stories behind each of the pieces he presented, while Corrigan delved much more into architecture and wanted us to know very detailed structural things. In fact, she was just much more detailed in general. I always tell people not to take ARTH 1 or 2 for an 'easy' art credit. If that's what you are looking for, there are certainly easier classes out there-- MOST of the higher level art history classes are in fact easier because they only focus on one time period. I highly recommend Kangas's Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Art class or any of Jane Carroll's Medieval art classes-- they're both really wonderful professors, and you will learn something in those classes.\"",

            "review 16: \"07F with Kathleen Corrigan: Professor Corrigan doesn't inspire much interest for any of the artwork that we studied in the last half of the class, but maybe that's because its such a wide spread of material. Don't take it unless you have to. Kangas is interesting though, and really good at explaining how art has transformed life throughout time.\"",
            "review 17: \"06F with Kathleen Corrigan: I walked into this class with no previous art history experience and no idea what to expect. I am not by any means an artistically inclined person, and, in taking this class, I was simply trying something new. However, Cohen and Corrigan successfully engaged me and gave me a new appreciation for art. Cohen, who lectured the first half of the term, is an extremely energetic woman whose enthusiastic attitude about art makes you want to appreciate the material as well. Her slide based lectures were always interesting, and despite the dimmed lights and big lecture hall, I never passed out during her lectures. Corrigan, who lectured the second half of the term, although not as charismatic as Cohen, was also a good lecturer, and was clearly fascinated by the material she was teaching (she is the department chair afterall). Sometimes her lectures would get a bit boring, and all the gothic cathedrals and madonnas would begin to look the same, and I would be unable to fight off sleep, but these moments were pretty infrequent. If you take notes in class, you should have all the information you need for the exams. Reading the textbook is pretty optional. Both the mid-term and the final require an enormous amount of memorization, but once the material is memorized, the tests themselves are very basic. Also, one of the perks of this course is that in between tests, other than one manageable paper assigned towards the end of the term, the workload is practically non-existent. The course wasn't as conceptual as I would have liked, and we covered a lot of material at a pretty fast pace, but that's what you have to expect with trimesters. On the whole I'd say this course gave me a very well-rounded introduction to art history, and I am very glad I took it.\"",

The second half is awful. Corrigan is not good at giving lectures and she covers at least twice as much material in the second half of the class as was covered in the first half. She surveys a ton of slides but does not go into any depth. Studying for the final is hell because there is so much material and the test is unfair. She expects students to be able to identify and write about works not discussed in the readings and that she barely covered in class.

I made all my juice from the midterm and the term paper, but I totally fell apart on the final because Corrigan, for all her kindness, does give a lot of gratuitous material and jumps around on the handouts. I\u2019m not free from blame of course, but there were simply too many churches and cathedrals that looked identical to me, and I\u2019m more of a lover of classicism than this monotonous train of medieval works. It seems though that despite my low grade on the final, I still received a fairly high grade on the course because I attended all the lectures and discussions, and EVERY single interdisciplinary conference posted by the Hood Museum (and I know, with Providence as my witness, that I was the ONLY student to have attended all those sessions). The professors, in my theory, seem to have liked it. So if your interests and academic tendencies are in my position, you\u2019d best follow my path. Try your very best to study your notes every single day and commit the hard facts of memorizing details and recognizing slides early. You can treat the cultural significance later. All in all, it is an interesting course but the assessment methods are far too stringent.

The readings were really helpful because they reinforced what they said and the textbook is awesome--FULL of pictures! I didn't sleep at night much this term, but I was awake for this class simply because I couldn't help but be interested. Be prepared to do a lot of memorization, but don't be intimidated by it.

Though a it's a large lecture class, class attendance is a must because the most important information is reviewed then, making completion of all of the readings unnecessary. Kangas and Carroll are good professors and getting to know them can help you feel more connected to what's going on in the class. This course has a midterm, final, and one 5 page paper.\"",

Also, don't spend as much time on memorizing the identification of the slides as memorizing the facts behind the slides. The professors say that you should be able to identify the slides, but the vast majority of the points on the test reside in the slide analysis. Even on the section of the test where you are supposed to identify the slides, most of the points come from the \"brief analysis\" of the slides. I am glad that this class is finally over. I would definitely not recommend taking this class to fulfill the Art distribution requirement.\"",
            "review 20: \"04F with Steven Kangas: Prof. Carroll really saved the day in what could have been a torturous pre-req class. The reading in the textbook, though engaging, wasn't the most interesting. There was a lot of textbook reading, but I feel like having done all of it really paid off, because thinking analytically like an art historian has become second nature even moreso than when I started out the term. The outside readings were much more interesting - not quite as pertinent to the course material, though. But, to be honest, if given an option, I would have probably read about half of them out of my own interest on my own time anyway - they really were that great. Prof. Kangas is well-intentioned, no doubt, and is genuinely concerned with imparting knowledge effectively. He is also one of the less approachable art history professors I've had, but I'd say he did a decent job overall. I think the problem in his half of the course was that he was trying a bit TOO hard to plow through the material on the surface in the name of a survey course. His lectures, towards the end of his portion, came across as extremely dry -- everything after Ancient Egypt up to Rome (where he ended) is honestly a big blur to me. He seemed to forget to mention the full historical implications of the stylistic elements he was pointing out, and at certain times there was a slight, but really biased, Western perspective towards the non-Western artwork that he presented that didn't quite seem right (it took a classmate pointing out a few instances to me for me to realize this). I'm told he's an Egyptologist, and his portions on Ancient Egypt were MAGNIFICENT, but beyond that I think the rest of the material was either out of his comfort zone or perhaps simply something he wasn't very interested in himself. Professor Carroll. WOW. She is amazing in 18327219362733287 different ways. I have several friends who stopped coming to class after the first week, and I convinced them to show up when Prof. Carroll took over and they never missed a class thereafter - that is what a great lecturer she is!! She has a sense of presenting the \"art\" aspect and the \"history\" aspect in good sync - her lectures were truly captivating because they melded together the stylistic elements of each objcct examined through sociocultural kaleidoscope -- the way a good art history class should be. She is also extremely approachable and will always help you out - undoubtedly the best prof I have encountered at Dartmouth. Exams: Go into them with a \"comme ci, comme ca\" attitude. I think I wanted to kill myself after the final, but I figured I had studied as much as possible and there wasn't anything I could do or couldn't have done, so I felt good about it. Remember that analysis counts over mere identification, though. OVERALL: I can never get my friends to take Art History classes because they have heard horror stories (such as those infamous professors we've all heard of who are convinced that anything and everything is a phallic symbol), but I've taken a few and I can tell you there's no truth to them. If you're one of those skeptics, take this survey class and convince yourself that Art History isn't deserving of the bad rap it gets around campus. Prof. Kangas put in an honest effort, and Prof. Carroll is amazing - don't miss out!\"",

Also go over your notes and reference the texts (do the reading!!!), and then if you have any questions go to office hours and ask!
