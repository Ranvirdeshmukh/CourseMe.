Check. High-grade median? Check. Nonsense topic? Check. Great Layuplist reviews? Not entirely. The listing on the ORC catalog claims that the course focuses \"on the history, culture and literature of Los Angeles, California,\" while the course objective on the syllabus reads, \" o expand your understanding of how a multiethnic, multiracial, and multinucleated modern metropolis built on the constant inflow of migrants facilitates differential opportunity and vulnerability in the United States.\" You might be surprised to learn then that >90% of the assignments have nothing to at all to do with LA and certainly not with \"vulnerability.\" Instead, the assignments will all be video editing projects on Adobe Premiere Pro which the professor spends ~0 minutes explaining how to use. Instead, he outsources the software teaching to some random librarian during the Friday afternoon X-Hour which he himself does not attend. You might think that having the assignments be based on using software many students have never touched, and he himself never teaches, would make him more forgiving when it comes to grading. You'd be dead wrong. Your film didn't include credits? Deduct points. Your credits were up too long? Deduct points? Credits hard to read? Deduct Points. He just feels like it? Deduct points. If you call out his arbitrary grading practices, he's usually honest enough to acknowledge them, but he'll never give you the points back. I could forgive all of this if he just had an ounce of self-awareness about his class. It's a 10A during the summer with assignments entirely uncorrelated to the lectures, yet he's still a tyrant about attendance. After this class, I've found myself questioning the value of academia and I'm ashamed that I paid tens of thousands for this experience. Do not make my mistake.\"",

Which is fine--of course all of us deserve good grades--as long as there wasn't a double standard. But there was because none of his video editing assignments (or any assignments) had a clear rubric and the descriptions are literally 2 sentences long. He took off points arbitrarily when people had a different interpretation of the prompt. Why there was amnesty for one situation and not others is unclear. He regularly used profanity in class, at one point talked about how sex is transformative for young people, etc. It was not relevant to the class in any major way. Yes this is an artsy class and is supposed to be edgy and cool and unrestricted. That still does not take away from the fact that he sometimes made it an uncomfortable environment.

It was a lot of work, and assignments like the chronology essays and biography paper, did not truly enhance the course material or what we were learning. Midterm and final were ok. Both take home exams that allowed students to choose what type of source to analyze and write about. Pretty easy.

In the summer, the class was almost entirely asynchronous which meant that beyond weekly readings and discussion board postings and comments, there was little other substance to the class.

Professor Nikpour is nice enough and very knowledgeable on Iranian history, but I wish that the class relied more on her knowledge and less on the hundreds of pages of reading for each week. Without the professor's input, it was very difficult to know what was important and what should be \"highlighted\" out of the very detailed and esoteric books we were reading. In terms of assignments, 50% of the class grade was the weekly discussion posts and your responses to other posts; in other words, it wasn't difficult to get an A. The other 50% was split equally between two paper assignments. The first was simple enough, a paper on western encroachment in Iran, but the final paper was insane. It consisted of two 2,000-2,500 papers in one assignment. In other words, we had under a week to research, develop, write, and edit two full-fledged papers of about 8 pages each. Despite the amount of work though, Nikpour is a fairly lenient and understanding grader. Take this class at your own risk, but if you're willing to put in some self-study work it can be rewarding.\""

Even though it was during the K block (which meant almost two hour classes over Zoom... not an environment that makes it easy to focus), Professor Melendez-Badillo gave us 5 minute breaks halfway through class and would let us go early on some days (and over an hour early on the final day of class).

There were a few people on my program who visited their FSP later in the term while the paper was being written and they found it very difficult. Definitely make sure you plan accordingly to visit your archives early in the term because research can sometimes end up taking many many hours a week. Some projects may require more or less time and its always helpful to know that ahead of time. Each step of this class is a bit tedious (figuring out archives, making a schedule, looking through lots and lots of old books) but there are parts that just make it an amazing experience, especially when it comes to writing your paper. Thankfully, the assignments are pretty helpful in keeping you on track to make sure your paper is well done and Petruccelli (and Erickson, from what I've heard) are very good at giving advice on papers and pretty understanding if you end up hitting a bump in the road (needing extension, the archive doesn't work out and switching topics, etc.).

Most of the work will take place with your adviser, and the pro of having a more engaged / rigorous adviser is that they'll stay on top of you. Chill advisers can be really nice and supportive, but they might not urge you to stick as closely to a rigorous timetable. The honors thesis can be a lot of work, and I definitely recommend taking manageable / easy classes in the winter so that you progress on it (even a one-course term plus the thesis, which counts for the second class, wouldn't be a terrible idea). THE YEAR WILL PASS BY QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY THE WINTER AND SPRING TERMS (fall term felt slow, but maybe that was because of Covid-19). I also recommend working on your thesis over the winterim / December break, even if you just spend the time refining your topic in consultation with your adviser by reading primary and secondary sources. But if you get a chapter done during winter break and another 1.5-2 chapters during winter term (for a total of three body chapters after spring break), that's gold. (ALSO, I recommend drafting a body chapter and not an introductory chapter during History 98 because everyone had to change their intros anyway.) Some other classmates and I did not work on our theses enough in the winter and we really had to hammer them out during spring break and Weeks 1-7 of the spring term.

Pamela K. Crossley possesses many shamanic qualities herself; chief among these is the manner in which she speaks. The nescient might draw comparisons between her train of thought and the Mongol Empire, suggesting that both are nomadic. However, to the learned, her lectures represent an opportunity for intense academic and spiritual growth. Oftentimes, topics presented sequentially in lecture and text appeared unrelated, but for students divinely bestowed with an esoteric knowledge of set theory from a young age, the threads of truth intertwining seemingly discrete events in history manifested in one's mind's eye. Pamela K. Crossley lectures demanded students assume an altered, enlightened state of consciousness if they hoped to decipher her utterances, and the course textbook, which she authored, similarly lacked such chronology that unenlightened and allistic individuals presuppose. However, the enlightened student, equipped to engage with ideas presented in these ways, is likely to find himself gaining troves of enigmatic knowledge derived from Pamela K. Crossley's gnostic-esque declarations and writings. This enlightenment, however, is unlikely to come from a literal interpretation of the lecture or the text but rather from the penumbras, formed by emanations from those sources that help give them life and substance. For those adhering to shamanic or gnostic traditions, there is a lot to gain from the course and enrolling is likely a worthy endeavor.

Most of the work will take place with your adviser, and the pro of having a more engaged / rigorous adviser is that they'll stay on top of you. Chill advisers can be really nice and supportive, but they might not urge you to stick as closely to a rigorous timetable. The honors thesis can be a lot of work, and I definitely recommend taking manageable / easy classes in the winter so that you progress on it (even a one-course term plus the thesis, which counts for the second class, wouldn't be a terrible idea). THE YEAR WILL PASS BY QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY THE WINTER AND SPRING TERMS (fall term felt slow, but maybe that was because of Covid-19). I also recommend working on your thesis over the winterim / December break, even if you just spend the time refining your topic in consultation with your adviser by reading primary and secondary sources. But if you get a chapter done during winter break and another 1.5-2 chapters during winter term (for a total of three body chapters after spring break), that's gold. (ALSO, I recommend drafting a body chapter and not an introductory chapter during History 98 because everyone had to change their intros anyway.) Some other classmates and I did not work on our theses enough in the winter and we really had to hammer them out during spring break and Weeks 1-7 of the spring term. I don't recommend that, as it was stressful and some of your friends will be having fun during senior spring without you.

Support for the thesis generally isn't that great tbh; be sure to befriend your adviser. Otherwise, I think writing a thesis is good. This class was just ok, but I've had lots of other good history courses and writing a thesis is worthwhile.\""

            "review 1: \"19X with Annelise Orleck: This class is purely discussion-based and everyone takes turns leadings discussions (everyone probably goes about three times, always with a partner) based on the day's readings. The readings are really intense but are really interesting. Sometimes they are just a typical history class reading load (Maybe 100 pages a class?) but sometimes they definitely pushed the limit. By the middle of the term, most people weren't doing all of them and just skimming. The research paper is 15-25 pages and it gets pretty hefty but is not impossible- you get to do a first draft. Almost everyone in the class got high grades (as you can see by the average). I definitely would recommend this class if you are interested in the material, you learn a lot about the different affinity groups that make up U.S. history. It's really about getting through the readings and participating in class. But, if you're not into the subject, might not before you. I know some of my classmates found the readings monotonous. Professor Orleck is really nice and great to talk to for the research paper but is sometimes slightly disorganized (sometimes readings would change last minute). Pro tip: stay on top of those discussion posts! It's fine to have a few a week late but if you wait for more than that they really really pile up.\""

It focused on the early modern period of English history, so I highly recommend taking Early Modern England with Estabrook before this class to ground yourself in the foundations of the material it covers. Estabrook also requires you to take two courses with him or go on the History FSP to London before he'll let you into the class. The class was discussion-based, with a decent but not overwhelming amount of reading required for each class. Structurally, the main assignment was a 20-page paper due Week 8, which was slightly tricky timing but meant you're pretty much done with the course by that point. Besides that, you have to give two 10-15 min presentations on a reading and a progress report to the class at some point on your research prior to the paper being due. The class was a 2A but we often got let out 15-20 minutes early which was clutch. Estabrook is super helpful wrt providing good sources for your paper and helping you figure out its direction. On the last day of class, he took us to the Norwich Inn and we had tea and discussed each others' papers. I got a ton out of this class and highly recommend it for any History majors interested in English history.\""

            "review 1: \"19F with Annelise Orleck: I thought I'd give some tips about the UCL class on the History FSP because I went in with almost no info about how to approach it. Prof Orleck was our program director (kind of like a camp counselor, although she was a great academic resource too) and this class was taught by UCL faculty. We had various options of courses to choose from, including survey modules and advanced seminars, but many students (including me) needed to take a pre-1800 course and most pre-1800 courses were survey modules in this year's offerings. The main difference between the two is that survey modules run for the entire year and cover a longer period of history at a level that is less in-depth, much broader, and probably less intellectually stimulating than \"advanced seminars,\" which run for a single semester and tend to be open only to UCL second-year and third-year students. (Survey modules are open to UCL freshmen, UCL sophomores, and American students like us.) Therefore, Dartmouth students who take survey modules take only the first half of the module. Advanced seminars are also assessed with two essays of 2,500 words or less in length (including footnotes and endnotes, but excluding bibliography; one due after reading week and the other at the end of the term). Meanwhile, survey modules (for foreign students; UCL students in these classes don't seem to have any assessed work the first semester) are assessed with one essay of 4,000 words or less (again, including footnotes and endnotes, but not bibliography), due at the end of the semester. These papers are graded blindly, with two readers, and they determine your entire grade (participation counts for nothing, but at least 70% attendance is required at tutorial sessions). My survey module, \"Divided Societies: The Mediterranean World in the Age of the Crusades, 1100-1500\" with Patrick Lantschner, was well-taught and split cohesively into two semesters. Other survey modules were not this well-organized and many students didn't like their survey modules. It sounds like the \"British History: 1850-1997\" module was especially a waste of time because it wasn't well-taught (Estabrook at Dartmouth is better) and our students only learned about history up to the 1930s. People also didn't love the ancient Greece and Rome classes. Besides Lantschner, other good instructors were Margot Finn, Marie Pierre-Gelin, and probably others. Probably my most helpful advice is how to actually write your UCL paper(s) to get an A or A-. A translates to a 70 or above, or \"first,\" in the UCL grading system; 65-69, or \"upper second,\" is an A-; while 60-64, still \"upper second,\" is a B+. The requirements are outlined on the rubric, but I'd emphasize that you need to do a diligent, careful, and WIDE reading of the historiography (at least 8 or 9 sources) and find areas in which the historiography on a topic doesn't agree. Focus on answering the question that is provided (this isn't a research paper where you get to formulate the question yourself), but position yourself within the historiographical debate and make an argument about which assertions of historians are more plausible. Commenting briefly on methodology (ex.: where do these historians draw their info from, like what kinds of primary sources?) is also good. Make sure that you go beyond the successful paraphrasing of other historians & be sure that your position / individual argument shines through. I'd recommend picking the question you want to answer and starting to research at least two-and-a-half weeks before the deadline (or even 3 weeks in advance if you're doing the 4,000 word essay). Be sure to support all general claims with specific evidence (preferably from different sources) and, as alluded to before, have lots of secondary sources that you've read carefully. Primary sources are generally optional (unlike Dartmouth), but having 1-2 doesn't hurt. Don't underestimate how long it will take to read all the sources, and you can find the books you need in the UCL Main Library and Senate House. Your Dartmouth program director might also be helpful if you make an appointment with them (because, remember, they're teaching a class at UCL too and know how these papers are evaluated). UCL profs can't read drafts and you will be penalized if you exceed the word count. Still, getting an A or A- is definitely attainable as long as you give yourself enough time to research and revise. Hope this helps!\""

            "review 1: \"22F with Ian Stone: The reviews below are somewhat accurate, but I thought I would chime in and add a more up to date review of the class and professor now that he has a few years teaching Dartmouth students under his belt. As the reviews suggest, Stone has indeed changed his class to better fit the Dartmouth style rather than the British style. In fact, he would adapt the class as we were taking it and welcomed our criticism of the reading load and structure of the course. This was greatly appreciated, as it showed the class was not static but one dedicated to our own growth. In that vein, I do not think this class is the most rigorous in the department as other reviews suggest. However, it is possibly the most intellectually challenging--and if you take it seriously and take advantage of Stone's brain, you will grow massively as a historian. Professor Stone hopes that students can engage in high level historiographic debates in class and in papers, relying on complicated theories and schools of historical thought. This approach, though uncommon in the Dartmouth classroom, is typical in the UCL classes we also enrolled in and thus can actually serve as a tool if you reach out to Stone for help. That being said, adjusting to the level of historical debate Stone hopes for does take a long adjustment period. The first few classes went over everyone's head until we found our footing, and then I think it is safe to say everyone enjoyed the class. Do not be afraid to ask him for help at any point--he truly cares about students, especially those who seem to have even a tiny interest in what they are studying.That's all the info on course. Dr. Stone himself is a whole different story. He is the Londoner of all Londoners, and does everything he can to make you feel at home in the city. Though his personality is distinctly British, he has one thing in common with our Dartmouth professors: he cares about students. He has a unique way of making every student feel valued and included, no matter their interests, commitment level, or background knowledge. Because of this, I would recommend anyone remotely interested in London's history take the class, and take it seriously. The median has since gone up from the first time he taught it, so do not worry about your grade. You will learn so much more than the history of London, and get to know one of the history department's nicest professors along the way. As Stone will teach you, \"When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for there is in London all that life can afford.\"\"",
            "review 2: \"19F with Ian Stone: Ian's tours were good, but I'd warn that he is a very hard grader (although he might mellow out or curve up in the future). A B+ in Ian's class is at least a hard-earned A- in any other history course, an A- is truly exceptional work in his eyes, and getting an A is nearly impossible. He likes very concise writing on essays (although long and detailed answers for identifications), he wants you to criticize readings and take nothing at face value, and there will be subjectivity and ambiguity thrown in. It's probably the single hardest class in the department (at least in terms of grading, although there aren't pop quizzes). This was my only B+ in the history major and I worked extremely hard in the class. There's also tons of reading (we had 100-150 pages per week, although this might be reduced), but enjoy your time in London and skim most stuff because you'll be wasting your time. Don't be too punitive when evaluating peers in other groups on the projects either because those will translate directly into their grades. Is the FSP still worth it because London's great? Yes. But this class will be tough.\"",
            "review 3: \"19F with Ian Stone: This class has a reading load on the heavier side (but if you have taken a decent number of history classes, and I'm guessing you have, you'll be fine). It meets twice a week, once for a seminar and once for a walking tour around London. The tour around London is tons of fun because it's a lot of walking around. Definitely a highlight of each week. I do, however, think the seminar could be improved. Many times, we didn't even get to really discuss the readings because the class discussion wasn't really productive and was often off focus. Ian's grading is very unpredictable. As for the grading, there are two exams: a midterm and a final. His questions, especially those that as you to choose between the significance of two historical events, can be misleading. Technically, you can get away with going either way but often he told the class that we should not be afraid to answer \"both.\" He also really likes originality in your responses, which is subjective to his opinion and can lead to arbitrary grading. For the final project, you get to create your own walking tour around London. This was a lot of fun to do with a group and I enjoyed the experience but, at least for this term, we were graded by each other. Since the FSP was rather competitive, many people gave each other harsher comments. All in all, I definitely think this class was worth it and the tours made it a blast but if you are the type who cares a lot about your GPA, this may be a more difficult class to conquer due to its unpredictable nature.\""

She's extremely active in campaigns that fight for indigenous rights in Mexico, and her presentation of the material was so one-sided that it made even native Mexican students question her. History is about several points of view, not just one, and this is where Padilla fell flat. Also, the midterm (20%) covered too much material and was way too general - it was hard to tell what she was looking for at any point in the course. The presentations (10%)were useless & a waste of time, and her lectures were usually dull and marred by the tension in her voice (you have to hear her to know what I am talking about). The two papers (25%), in Weeks 8 and 10, were too much at once. Regarding the last paper, who can expect their class to read two whole novels in the last week of class? That was ridiculous. As for participation (20%), I think that only 5 students knew what was going on in the class. Everybody else came to class in an unexplainable stupor, and it was clear that it was because those students were not doing the reading. Folks, if you're going to take a history class, do the work, because if you don't, you ruin the learning experience for everyone...this is the worst group of students I've ever taken a class with. You should have been there for the class \"discussions\" on Fridays, it was really something, I tell you...the same 5 students who did the reading speaking up! Simply unacceptable on the part of the rest of the class...I would have given them all F's in participation if I were her, I wouldn't blame her if she actually did.

This class consisted of Prof. Padilla attempting to indoctrinate the students with an anti-US, borderline Commmunist perspective on the topic. This was a shame because it completely obscured legitimate critiques of US policy during the period. For a class with such interesting subject matter, it was a waste. Exams and papers consisted of explaining the arguments of the authors, not evaluating whether or not they made sense. I felt like I was back in high school. This class is an easy A if you follow the party line, which is don't critically analyze the course material and bash the US at all times. If, however, you want to engage in legitimate academic discourse, stay away.

The readings are great, and it is nice to have a professor who is really passionate about the subject. The tests are not bad, and the discussions are good. You should however stay away if you are narrow-minded or unwilling to learn that the U.S. government does some pretty horrific things.

Being a political economist, I was pretty fascinated. Plus, Japan has some interesting cultural baggage that it's trying to deal with right now, which is pretty interesting to read and think about. The only reason I didnt give the class an A is because the discussion sections were pretty weak, never went into much depth on the material, which is understandable given the time constraints, and a great review on the lecture material, but not very challenging intellectually.

It is not a layup and shouldn't be taken during a term where you have other difficult/time-consuming classes or if you only want to fulfill a distrib. I easily spent the same amount of time on this class that I have spent on hard STEM classes*** This was one of the most engaging and stimulating classes I have taken at Dartmouth, and it is certainly among my favorites. Professor Haynes provided a very well thought out selection of primary and secondary source readings that showcased diverse, conflicting, and interesting perspectives about the topics discussed in the class. There were also a multitude of films assigned---some of which were fun and entertaining, others of which were dark and thought provoking. The way in which the films were integrated with the readings and class discussions was seamless and furthered our understanding of the topics at hand. The assignments in the class consisted of three short papers (with the option to do a fourth with your lowest grade dropped, although I don't think anyone in the class actually opted for this option), two presentations, and two choices for the final. The first choice was an extended paper on one of the short paper topics and a written in-person examination. The second option was a longer, 12 page research paper on a topic of your own choosing. I believe that everyone in the class chose the second option. South Asia has a complex history, rich with conflicting and intersecting cultural/religious identities shaped under the hand (or crushing boot) of British colonial rule. This class is a must-take for anyone interested in colonial or postcolonial history. Professor Haynes provided the class with food at multiple points throughout the term (oftentimes enough to satisfy as lunch or dinner) and also invited us to a musical performance, which was pretty cool. He is a very chill, understanding, and friendly guy too. Overall, I would highly recommend this class if you are interested in the course material and willing to handle the workload.\"",

He has done decades of serious research on South Asia, and he puts a lot of work into his lectures and the structure of the class.

            "review 4: \"09W with Douglas Haynes: This was by far the most intellectually stimulating class I've taken at Dartmouth. It was also significantly more time than any other course I've taken. It's about 300-400 pages of reading every week, sometimes with a movie, and a short paper or outline pretty much every week. On the other hand, there was no really long assignment, nor was the final particularly difficult. (Actually, we all went a little overboard on the studying, I think. It's worth like 15% of your final grade, which is less than each individual paper.) The weekly discussion sections were really good--I think he's pretty good at asking questions where the answers are only drawn from the readings and some make for interesting debate. I would take this class again in a minute. But again, I put a lot of work into it, and I enjoyed the work, but it was a hard term. So, final advice? If you don't mind hard and really cool work, take the class. If you don't want to put a lot of time into it, don't.

LECTURES: The lectures were very interesting, I don't remember being bored even once during class. Quite captivating stuff. I do wish we had spent more time on India of the 1990s, though. I felt like we were harping on Pre-Independence India for a bit too long. PAPERS/OUTLINES: Everything is graded very toughly in this course. He seems to be a perfectionist, but he's great at bringing out your best. At times from discussions that everyone in the class would have about grading, I did feel as though the grade range was from 89 to 93 or so, which is frustrating because you don't really get a chance to know if you are doing really well. The fact that you get to rewrite one paper was nice, too. OVERALL: Great class. I especially enjoyed the cultural aspects discussed towards the end, they were englightening.

On average, 3 articles averagin between 30-40 pages are assigned for each class, sometimes rising to 6 or 7 over weekends. In addition, the grading structure of the class (3 outlines, 2 6-7 pp. papers -- due weekly -- and a final, 9-10 pp. paper)practically assured that you would be writing something most every weekend of the term. Professor Haynes himself is affable enough, but is not what one might call an inspiring lecturer (perhaps tepid is a better word), and seems to have no conception of the workload assigned.

In fact, in order to participate in class and complete all the assignments (a paper or an outline of a paper 5 weeks out of the term), I felt that I had to do all the reading, and I basically did. This was no easy task, considering this class had more reading on reserve than any other class I have ever taken (and I am a history major!). Some readings were great, especially the two novels that Professor Haynes chose to include, but the majority were dense and unintersting. The sheer volume of assigned reading made it difficult to fully appreciate any individual text. Unfortunately, skimming was not a good option considering the nature of the assignments--papers and outlines in which you are expected to cite most of the assigned sources. Because of the quantity of these assignments, I felt like I was doing work for this class every day, all term. Professor Haynes also tends to call x-hours and schedule movie nights, thus there is additional required class time as well. Professor Haynes himself is nice, approachable, and passionate about what he does. He does his best to be straightforward, inclusive, and fair. But lectures tend to be boring and uncreative, and you can't skip many because participation is a big part of the final grade. Overall, this class is a lot of work and the professor expects a hell of a lot. It is probably not worth your time unless you are very interested in the subject matter.

At times the material seemed repetitive (the discussion several times ended up being about the plight of marginal peoples), but I think given the state of affairs of the environment of Asia today it was a point worth validating more than once. Sometimes I felt bogged down in the massive amounts of reading, but during those times I just went into hibernation in my dorm room and read what I had to so that I wouldn't fall behind. The lectures were informative, though I wish there were a cumulative final exam at the end of the course -- it would have helped me show how much I'd really learned...I felt that in a collective sense, the papers didn't all necessarily cover all the material we covered in class, anyway, and a final exam would have been a good display of all that I'd really learned. Prof. Haynes is a great professor, and I am looking forward to taking other classes with him. Take this class if you're willing to do the work -- don't waste your time and certainly don't waste his if you don't plan to put in some serious effort.\""

I didn't feel engaged at all and I am a history major and normally would love these classes. I attended all the zoom discussions but didn't feel like I gained a lot from them. Readings are pretty long and weren't always relevant to the discussion posts (normally these discussions are in person).

She'll definitely drag you through the coals and there is a lot of reading (that you actually have to at least try to keep up with, for a change), but ultimately I got the feeling that as long as she is satisfied that people are making a good faith effort to learn and understand the material she won't try to kill anyone's grade or anything like that. Overall, the subject matter was interesting and the books were engaging and surprisingly readable. I took the class expecting to learn a lot but not necessarily have a good time doing it, given Crossley's reputation; I was pleasantly surprised at how much I ultimately enjoyed the experience. I should also take the time to mention that Crossley is a ridiculously learned person. She is one of the top scholars in her field (look her up on Wikipedia if you're curious) and she knows more than you ever will about Chinese history. Guaranteed. Although her lectures can be a bit dry, she is very good at explaining difficult concepts and and the modified Socratic method that she uses for discussion is quite effective. Crossley does have a few quirks, like the fact that she seemingly can't comprehend the idea that someone might have a question in the middle of her lectures, but these are minor problems.

We did touch upon Iraq and Egypt a bit, but not enough for a new-comer to the field to grasp the implications, and too little for an expert to learn anything new.

Nevertheless, his reading assignments, (which are quite optional), are very interesting. After the mid-term (which proved extremely easy), I didn't do any of the reading. I would have liked to, but since it wasn't imperative, didn't have to. The final assignment was a 15 page research paper on essentially any topic of your choosing.

It's a Tues/Thurs class, but Trumbull does a great job of breaking up the class: the first half is lecture, a 10 min break, and then the second half is discussion in small groups. I was a non-major and knew very little about Africa/Islam in general when I took this class, and the material we learned blew my mind. At the end of the term, we also learned more about modern terrorism and poverty, which was fascinating. Although the readings make this class seem tough, the midterm and final are totally doable -- Trumbull gives you the exact format of the exams beforehand, and it's all very straightforward. The essays are a little trickier, but I recommend that you go in to see Trumbull to have him look over your draft. He gives great feedback and is happy to help out. Which brings me to my last point: Professor Trumbull is SO invested in the success of his students. I was terrified for the first paper I wrote for his class, and he was more than willing to meet up with me (several times in a week) to go over my ideas, any questions I had, and read over my draft. He really wants his students to do well, and he loves when they come in for office hours. He's a professor whose class you HAVE to take at some point during your time at Dartmouth!!\""

This class is not a layup, but as History classes go it is not too hard if you do the reading and meet with him during office hours to discuss the papers. He will give you all the sources you need to write them and is very helpful with figuring out the direction of your argument. Some background understanding of British history is helpful but definitely not required. I really enjoyed this class, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting and very informative course. We also got to look over old documents in Rauner once a week which was pretty cool.\"",

Strongly recommend taking this class. You can find the syllabus on the history department website if you want to see more details\"",
            "review 3: \"22S with Carl Estabrook: NOT A LAYUP. Estrabrook is a demanding and dull professor. Exams were difficult, tons of reading, and lectures were very boring with Estabrook's dry lecture style. Would not recommend taking this class.\"",
            "review 4: \"08S with Carl Estabrook: Estabrook is an amazing lecturer. Sometimes I think he must practice them beforehand, because they're perfectly co-ordinated. He'll talk about a million different examples in five different areas, and somehow manage to tie it all back together into one unifying theme. You will learn a lot in this course. That being said, some of the readings were painfully boring and pedantic, and the lectures and readings often had nothing to do with each other. The idea behind that was that the readings would present certain aspects of a topic and Estabrook would present another aspect so we'd have a holistic understanding, but sometimes the assignment of readings to lecture topics made no sense. There was also a LOT of reading. Be prepared for around 10 articles/book chapters each week. The assignments are not at all a fair assessment of course material, but I suppose that's a problem with a lot of history courses. Papers are graded on a \"can you follow Estabrook's format\" scale - no matter how good your ideas and arguments are, you max out at a B+ unless you follow his format. Exams were often disappointing in that he'll pick a couple of questions which do relate to the topic, but don't really do justice to the major themes that we spent the majority of the class talking about. I felt like I knew TONS from this class which the exams did not give me the opportunity to show, so in that sense the evaluations need to be improved.\"",
            "review 5: \"08S with Carl Estabrook: Professor Estabrook is a good dude, he really cares about students learning. The class was a little different because he put a large emphasis on learning how to study history. I didn't feel like I learned all that much history, but I definitely improved my writing and evaluating skills. If you wish to take this class, I would strongly advise coming in with a working knowledge of British history. That would really help.\"",
            "review 6: \"08S with Carl Estabrook: as far as I can tell, this class is more of a fusion of history, anthropology, and sociology than a pure history class. accordingly, without much of a background in these fields and a minimal background in early modern British history I often had difficulty synthesizing the enormous amounts of material (and there is a ton; especially plentiful and super dense readings that are NEVER mentioned in class yet expected for the final). there is not much written work: two 7-9 papers on broad topics (you narrow down) and a final. however, estabrook is a difficult grader and knows everything about britain, so there is no chance of bluffing your way through assignments. you will learn a lot of interesting facts and much british history; but the \"atlantic\" perspective is limited for the most part to the american colonies and the majority of the emphasis is on britain. this class is probably better for upperclassmen who have a better background in the various subjects (such a student might get more out of it than I did) but is certainly doable without too much stress for freshman.\""

Other important works which I'd learned about but never actually read were assigned, such as Darwin's \"Origin of Species\", and it's a good excuse to actually read them. I took physics 19 concurrently and they lined up well, especially as we got to Einstein. The class took a view of science that was less familiar to me and I learned a lot from it.

Possibly a misguided view, especially if Kuhn's paradigm idea was simply accepted. However, the Prof was excellent, and kept his facts separated from his opinions. His lectures, were full of interesting ideas and facts, and I never tired of them. However, I thought the weekly class discussions were weak.

There was one longer paper that had a specific prompt, which I never really like, but it was relatively easy if you organized well enough. There was a blue book midterm and another for the final, neither of which was really hard or surprising in its contents. Professor Whelan is a good lecturer - she had an interesting accent which is fun to listen to and organizes her lectures effectively with interesting quotes and anecdotes etc. The class was small so we were able to have some discussion.

Out of the unfathomable amount of writing and filming that has occured in the last 100 years, Professor Koop has pulled out some of the most important, or most moving, or most illustrative pieces.

Furthermore, the assignments are backloaded, with one midterm about five weeks into the course, a paper due in the seventh week, and a final paper due in the tenth week. There's something of a contradiction in focusing the content of the course much, much more heavily on the first half to the century and then assigning grades based on assignments which more or less equally distribute importance between both halves. At any rate, the lectures were extremely engaging, though sometimes excitement and hilarious anecdotes came at the expense of a coherent thread, especially during the later lectures (for example, the rise of fascism in Germany took up an entire class, while the final three decades of the century for ALL of Europe get covered in three lectures at the very end of the term). The assignments are one midterm which counts for 25% of the grade which essentially is about regurgitating a maximum quantity of information within one exam period (Koop gives one 'point' for every 'interesting thing' you say in response to a question, up to the total number of points that a particular question is worth), a 7-8 page essay which counts for 25% of the grade that's rather complex and convoluted, and a final paper of 10 pages or so that's highly concerned with how your personal views have influenced your personal understanding of Europe in the Twentieth Century (a bit bizarre and irrelevant if you ask me, but I'm sure plenty of people like the opportunity for self-exploration). All in all, it's a great class, but Koop gets plenty of stellar reviews so I figured I might as well try to provide a bit more of a balanced take.

            "review 14: \"05F with Allen Koop: Because I joined this course late I started out behind in the reading and was quite simply never able to catch up. The textbook itself was informative but extremely dense and slow going, and each week we were expected to read multiple chapters in it plus two other books, usually slightly easier going but still weighty enough. I managed to scrape by with a decent grade at the cost of multiple all-nighters and a scaled test grade that was nothing short of miraculous. The other critique I have of this course is the heavy emphasis on the early twentieth century. I took this course primarily because while I had a solid background in European history from my high school classes, every year my high school teachers ran out of time before we got to the mid-twentieth century. I figured taking a class solely about the twentieth century would fill in the gaps. I was somewhat disappointed; the first two-thirds of the class spanned 1900-1945, but the 1980s were covered in a single day. I understand that the two World Wars defined the rest of the century but I still think a more balanced view might be appropriate, particularly since we have now exited the twentieth century. That said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this course - Professor Koop is an amazing lecturer. He is really passionate about his subject but also brings his own brand of sarcastic humor to class. He taught us the material as if it were a personal story, and made us feel the impact of all the events. He told us he expected us to be moved to tears at least once during the term and I think we all had that experience. In short I would reccomend this course but be forewarned about the reading, and whatever you do don't get behind!\"",

His lectures are well organized and well timed. He really tries hard to make his class enjoyable, and he started out by saying \"my goal is to make this the best class you've ever had at dartmouth.\" There is a tremendous amount of reading in this course. He assigns about 9 historical novels in addition to the textbook which is about 700 pages. There are another 5 optional novels. There is one exam, which is a mixture of short answers and essays. That's worth about a quarter of the grade and it's not too hard. Then there is an 8 page paper worth about a quarter of the grade. Then there is a 12 page final paper worth 50 percent of the grade. He's not an especially hard grader, and just about any argument will be fine as long as it is well written and demonstrates a good understanding of history. There are also about 10 required movies, and another 3 optional movies. The way he gets you to do all of the reading and movie-watching is by putting questions on the test and by making you discuss the novels and movies in your papers. He also takes kind of a \"creative\" approach to class, for better or worse. At times he opens up class to discussion, and he holds optional weekly discussion sections outside of class. In lectures, he generally stays focused, but at times he goes on remote tangents (winny the poo, flowers, etc.) and tries to relate them to the course or make analogies. On his webpage he also has a message board. The level of student participation in the online discussion is given consideration in the grade, but it is not given a fixed percentage. His essay topics are fill in teh blank, and sometimes require interpretting poetry. For example: \"_____ and _____ led to the success of fascism and ____ and ____ led to its failure. Insert words from the following poem into the above blanks.\" On the other essay, he \"invited\" us to discuss in our conclusion how \"your view of yourself is reflected in your view of 20th Century European history.\" Overall, I would strongly recommend the course.\""

Some people will take a government or history course thinking that they can get by skimming the reading and taking good notes in class. This does not work here. Although Ermarth has a phenominal grasp of the material, his lectures on it can be a bit shady. He will tend to write an outline on the board at the start of class and then proceed to digress into broad (and sometimes non-related) trends that skirt around the main issues. I actually thought some of his lectures were fantastic; it's just that the other ones were at best subpar. The best classes are when he initiates discussion. Unfortunately, since he can get bogged down on one topic and have to catch up in later class periods, these discussions are few and far between. Be prepared to read, as the syllabus is very inconsistent. You may find yourself reading thirty pages one night and two hundred the next. The books, like the professor's lectures, are a mixed bag. Two are worthless (yet short) German history summaries; two are good more detailed summaries, two are period-specific, there's Demian, and there's a horribly boring book on three German thinkers. There is this one book by Sebastian Haffner on Hitler that is amazing though. One potential selling point for this class is the workload. There are no tests. There are just three 1500-2000 word papers, one for the midterm and two for the final. Overall, I enjoyed this class. Although the lectures were not as detailed as I might have liked, I came out of this class with ten times the perspective on German History as I had before. Be forwarned. If you take this class, you will: (1) Not only have a much better understanding of Nazi Germany but also beware the Jenninger effect and not justify it. (2) For the rest of your life have the dual images of a guy named Michel in pajamas and a guy named Michael in armor ingrained into your head. (3) Be able to start jokes with \"So Hitler, Goebbels, and Goerring are flying in a plane...\"\"",

Not surprisingly, class is generally very poorly attended and those who do show up often wish they hadn't. However, that being said, if you're a Germanophile, really really like German History, or want to just find out more about the trouble-maker country of Europe, you'll probably be all right in the course. Since the lectures are so irrelevant, all of your learning will be done through the copious readings. And luckily, many of the readings are stimulating and enjoyable. Think of it as reading good history books for credit. At least Ermarth's grading system leaves little to complain about-- one midterm, worth 1/3 of the grade, as a 5-7 page take-home paper, and the final, two such papers, is worth 2/3 of the grade. Students also have the option of writing a 20-30 page research paper instead of the final on any subject in the course they choose. So, if you're writing the research paper, after the midterm, there's no need to keep on pace with the readings or bother to pay attention in class.\""

That said, if you are at all interested in British history, this is a worthy class to take. And if you are going to do the History FSP in London, you absolutely should take it, no question. Estabrook is a wonderful lecturer, and his knowledge of his British history is deep and extensive for every time period. If you are interested in social/cultural history, you will love the readings, which are often local histories. If you are interested in high politics, you will be disappointed somewhat, but still will learn the basics (Gladstone, imperial decline, Thatcherism, etc.). Make sure to do the readings. Or if you cannot do the whole article, grasp its thesis, because the exams (two of them; 1200 word essays) are in essence historiographical. The exams ask you to assess a quotation about British history from a certain historian, and Estabrook expects you to include in your response how other historians have addressed that same topic. Deviate from this format at your own risk. The big assignment is the 12pp term paper, on any topic you choose. Two risks to avoid. 1) pick a very narrow topic, it is easy to get lost in a broad focus. 2) start early, like, week 2 early; the paper is due week 8 and it WILL sneak up on you. Overall, the course was exasperating at times, dull at others, but in general, fascinating. I learned a great deal about British history, and also about how to write history well. Estabrook can be a hard grader, but his feedback is absolutely amazing (1,000 words of comments on a 1200 word exam!).

This was AMAZING, and is a perfect example of the cohesion and effectiveness of his lecture style. Estabrook balances examples and overarching arguments perfectly. The evaluations sucked, though. He does not give enough time on his exams, and they barely scratch the surface of the smorgasbord of things we covered in class. It's perfectly possible to do all of the readings, attend all of the lectures, study really hard, and bomb the exams if he happens to choose questions from areas which you didn't concentrate on in your studying. The exams were not a fair assessment of understanding and retention of course material. The essay grading is also pretty annoying. Estabrook is obsessed with having you present a scholarly debate, to the point that even if you present a piece of the most original, insightful, well-researched and argued historical analysis around, he will never give higher than a B+ if you don't reference other people who have worked on the same topic.

It's abundantly obvious that he couldn't possibly care less about his students. This term he had one office hour on Wednesday and one on Thursday, both during class times, so it was entirely possible that some students could never go see him, and he didn't respond to blitzes at all- I know from experience. On the exams, he just expected us to recite the names and arguments of each historian whose work we'd read, and he was rarely available for consultation on the final paper (except for the first few weeks of the term, when everyone had to consult with him about a topic during his extremely restrictive office hours). If Prof. Estabrook made himself available to students to discuss assignments or just talk about the course material, this course could potentially be an interesting experience.

But you will also learn that Wilkes was a member of the notorious Hellfire Club, whose drunken members used to urinate off balconies and onto the heads of pedestrians.

You will, however, discuss a lot of pointless things, such as trends in crossdressing and sexual deviancy, because the prof is pretty much obsessed with the topic. He spends an inordinate amount of time discussing social history and contemporary historiography. On the papers and exams, he expects you to have a strong command of all the modern historians that have weighed in on various aspects of early modern (social) history in England. In lectures, he never tells you what actually happened in history (such as what the Spanish Armada was, when it happened, and why), but he will say things like \"At the same time as the Spanish Armada, many people were homosexuals.\" Like I said, useless. None of the readings actually provide an informative background text to give you an understand of the events of the period. They are biographies and small case studies, with a strong social focus, and they are not at all interesting. The class discussion is a waste of time because you spend it listening to music that was written in the period and guessing who wrote it. I highly recommend avoiding this class, and this professor.

His one weakness is discussion--he needs to step back a little more and let the students talk rather than jumping in.

Additionally a lot of the material in this course is in the realm of historiography, rather than pure history. Thus you spend a HUGE amount of time comparing modern historical interpretations, and he makes a subtle point out of your responsibility to be constantly reconciling/deciding amongst what interpretations to accept as fact. For a lot of students, this course will be interesting, involving and intellectually challenging.

The only midterm was a day before the withdraw deadline and you get your midterm back the same day you turn in your major research paper.

I thought he was kidding at first, but I wouldn't be shocked if he were serious. On an average week, you can expect to read at least 200 pages.

By the same token, he wrote about four pages in my blue book in response to my essay offering advice and constuctive criticism. After taking this class, I do feel like a much better writer. I feel more confident in analyzing arguments and fashioning my own. I enjoyed seeing my hard work pay off. Let's talk about Professor Estabrook for a second. You need to realize that this man is a leader in his field. He has dedicated his life to the history of Britain. He knows dates, people, places and concepts better than you could ever comprehend. His lectures are very well crafted and interesting. He is available for help outside of class and his advice can seem priceless at times. He is more than willing to discuss his lectures, even critically. He was invaluable when I was planning my essay because he could name books and authors that have written extensively on my narrow subjet. I know some people are intimidated by him, perhaps a majority of the class. If you go in, do your work and not be lethargic then you have nothing to fear. If you want to invoke his wrath, do something to interrupt his lecture, like eating a powerbar and blinding him with reflected light off the wrapper. Am I glad I took this class? Definitely. Would I take another class with him? Of course, but I would realize that I'd be kissing my social life away for another term. Do I recommend it highly? Absolutely.

Yes, Darrow knows the time period back to front, writes a crap load on your papers (probably more pages than your actual paper), her lectures are \"meh\" and the readings were good, but the overall quality of the class was so-so. She didn't inspire me to go out and find out more and read more by myself. Even though her lectures were okay, it was hard to follow a linear line in terms of the events of the revolution. 2 5 page papers (do the readings!) 1 10-15 page research paper 1 final (prepare the question and read over notes, maybe once and that will get you through the final with flying colors, I'm sure). 1 written response\"",

Her lectures are well-organized and she uses powerpoint to give an outline of the lecture, highlight quotes and passages, and present images, pictures, and maps. Basically, though, she shows you pictures of famous people that she mentions during her lecture. It's okay. She does make an effort to know your name, and she can be very helpful at office hours. A lot of the assigned reading is pretty boring, and the paper topics really aren't that interesting, either. She does bring in a lot of different perspectives and different primary sources, which I think is valuable. I felt like she focused on the role of women a little bit too much.

He's thought-provoking, clear, thorough, and funny The bad: Lago is horrible at structuring classes. I'm a Junior History major, and every other History prof I've had has explicitly stated that ten weeks is too little time to write a research paper. Lago makes you write two. As a result, you never do the assigned read (I probably read 5% of it, my friend in the class read literally zero pages of it ) because you're researching and writing all the time. As a result, you'll finish the class knowing a ton about two extremely narrow areas of Spanish history that you wrote your papers on, and nothing about the rest of Spanish history. I can tell you anything you want to know about the comparative treatment of Jews and Muslims in 15th-century Spain or about how the failures of the Spanish Armada and English Counter-Armada reveal the limitations of warfare in the sixteenth century. And that's all I can tell you. Why did Ferdinand and Isabella marry? No idea. Why did Spain lose the Netherlands? I've got nothing. Why did Spain rise and fall? Nada.

You do not want to spend hours writing an 8 page research paper on an obscure topic that will not be revelant on the final. The final was okay. There is an essay question that he gives you the prompt for before hand and 15 identifications/short answers i.e. what is going on in this picture, define this term and its importance in Spanish history. You answer 12 of the 15 short answer questions. To do well in this class just use common sense, go to class, start papers early, review them if possible. I also suggest that if you get your paper reviewed by the professor (he will do a brief overview because of the large number of students), also go to RWIT, they can really help you organzie your paper. Once your done with the paper, reread the prompt to be sure that you answered the question.

Incredibly nice, Lagomarsino is also extremely accomodating to student needs, and always has an open door. The suggested reading for the course is extensive, but the required readings are certainly managable. When I took it the grading included two papers of decent length. Lago is a fair grader, but if you want an A on a paper you definitely have to work for it. The class also has a pretty extensive final examination.

            "review 28: \"03F with P. David: Before taking this course, I had heard that Professor Lagomarsino was the best history professor at Dartmouth; although I haven't taken classes with all of Dartmouth's history profs, I really couldn't imagine a better prof than Lagomarsino. He is the rare professor who is both extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic in his subject area and is also a terrific teacher. This course covered a long period of history--from the 14th century into the 17th century--but his lectures were always stimulating and were consistently organized around a concrete theme. The list of course readings was quite extensive; Lagomarsino stressed, however, that only a small percentage of these readings are required--the other readings are intended to help the student choose and explore possible essay topics. Two 2500-word research essays were assigned; Lagomarsino went out of his way to meet with all of the thirty-plus students in the class and to aid them in the writing process. I found his advice to be very helpful; although my topics were not in his prime area of interest, he was still able to guide me towards those resources that would help me most in my research. I only wish that there was enough time in the quarter to allow for more discussion sessions--Lagomarsino did hold two optional discussions; I would highly encourage attending both. However, the high quality of his lectures and the fact that he makes himself available during and outside of office hours for discussion more than compensates for the relative lack of class discussion. My advice: take one of Lagomarsino's course whether you are a history major or not--he is a rare treasure; the chance to study with him during your time at Dartmouth should not be passed up.\"",

His lectures are unbelievably clear and insightful. I entered the course with the intention of fulfilling the pre-1700 distributive for my history major and came out wanting to study early European history much more in-depth. Whether or not you think you're interest in early European history, take this class! Lagomarsino will make this class worth your while and make the subject interesting for you.

I'm a history major with a concentration in Early Modern Europe, and I've already taken Hist 3 with Lagomarsino, which is a pretty similar course to Hist 45, but I guess that demonstrates how amazing of a professor he is. This is course is primarily based in lectures. If you do not like/can't pay attention/stay awake/show up for a lecture class, this is not the class for you. There is no midterm, and the final exam is IDs(and he gives you the essay question before hand), but the entire exam is based on his lectures. The fact that my concentration is in Early Modern Europe may have given me an edge on the exam, but honestly a lot of the information is either common European historical knowledge, or you would recognize it as one of the major points of European History that he identified in his lectures. I would even venture to say that the books are not completely necessary (unless you have little-to-no background in European History) for doing well in the course. Lago is an AMAZING lecturer with subjects that are rarely boring. And, if you've already taken Hist 3, you might recognize the topics! He is very lenient with paper dates (he's cognizant of the busy lives Dartmouth students lead and of the fact that profs in the history department often schedule paper due-dates for the same date), is completely available for office hours, and is an all-around great guy. That's why he's my major adviser! Honestly, an amazing History course that should be required at Dartmouth.\"",

Details are important for the final but they aren't obscure things that no one would know. Overall, a good course with a solid prof.\""

No regular work besides reading a terrific selection of primary texts (e.g.: Machiavelli, Luther, Calvin, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Spinoza). Papers are analyzes of primary texts so no research required. Final is doable if the work is spread out over the course of 3-4 days. I won't say DMM is an easy grader but he is extremely fair. Always gives you detailed and legit comments. Always willing to discuss the papers and help out. Increasingly lenient grading towards the end of the term. Read the books, do actually grapple with the texts, and you will be fine. As DMM said, the grades will take care of themselves. He's not trying to kill your way to law school.

The midterm and final are pretty fair, though some of the questions can be strange. You really need to know your stuff for the exams.

I'm usually a person who reads everything but I didnt for this class and it was fine. The midterm and final were both very broad and the final was not cumulative so it wasn't hard to study for. Prof. Simons is a great lecturer- funny and very organized. I wasn't at all interested in the topic at first but he made it a lot of fun- its a shame the readings were so bad though. To prepare for the exams, just have everyone in the class blitz out their essays on the books and that will prepare you enough instead of actually reading the books. You can get by in the discussion without actually knowing too much. There was also a 11-12 page research paper on any topic and simons was more than willing to help with getting sources.

So its got that going for it, which is nice. But the key to this class is Simons. He is a phenomenal lecturer, and can make the most arcane of subjects seem crucial and fascinating. He uses a lot of different media, including slides, handouts, and movies (Including an Abelard and Heloise porno - no joke). He is helpful in office hours, especially for your final research paper. The discussion sections on the book are every week, and very informative. They are also more important than lectures for the exams, as most of the exam material was on the books. The TA who led half the discussion sections was very knowledgable.

He gives great lectures, is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, and also acknowledges that there are other opinions out there besides his. The workload was on the heavy side but not impossible. Some of the readings were boring and/or difficult, but they really helped put the lecture material in perspective.

He gives two lectures a week, and the other class is a discussion section for one of the readings. Thus, we know when to finish the readings, and each one of them is worth it. I really, really enjoyed the readings he assigned--they were fascinating, readable, and really worth the effort. Not only this, but Professor Simons is just one of the kindest, gentlest, and most enthusiastic professors I have met here. He seems to really love his job. When you go see him about a topic for a paper, he doesn't just give you advice, but he gets on the computer and looks up sources for you! He is such a great professor. If you have any chance, take a class with him. I have to warn you though, you might be tempted to become a medievalist yourself! :) Really, though, I cannot give him a better recomendation.

My only regret is that I didn't take it earlier in my Dartmouth career...\"",
            "review 40: \"05W with Walter Simons: This is a great class and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The class is basically an overview of the history of the Middle Ages, with an emphasis on the development of the Catholic Church. There is of course a ton of scholarship regarding the Middle Ages and it would be physically impossible to cover everything in a ten week term, but I felt by the end that we really had covered a great variety of subjects, even while focusing on certain key points. Professor Simons is an excellent teacher and lecturer. His lectures inspired interest in the topics he was talking about and he and the TA encouraged real debate and interpretation during the discussions. Finally, he is just a great guy that seems like he really cares for his students. Case in point: during the term after I took this class, I got a blitz from Professor Simons about a particular public lecture that was taking place in several days. When he heard of this lecture, he remembered that I had written my final paper about this and that I had a deep interetest of the topic. I should point out that I had only gone to his office after class once, to discuss my paper topic. The book list is a really impressive body of medeival European thought. A couple of the secondary sources he had us read were a bit less than engaging, but on the whole the reading for the class often seemed more like pleasure than work. In terms of grading, he was tough but fair. He certainly expects you to present logical and well-supported arguments in your exams and papers, but with that said, if you put in the effort, you will most probably do well. The paper requirements were broad enough that you could pretty much write about any aspect of the Middle Ages that fascinated you, literally (Simons specifically stated you didn't have to confine yourself to stuff covered in lecture). The class presupposes no knowledge on the subject, so it's accessible to both History majors and non-majors. All in all, a very enjoyable experience.\"",
            "review 41: \"05W with Walter Simons: Simons knows his history. He loves teaching it too - it's particularly obvious during the weekly discussion sections, as he really enjoys engaging in debates over various concepts and issues. He's not too arrogant to admit that there are plenty of correct and valid interpretations, and it really shows. At the same time, he knows a LOT - don't try to BS your way through the class, because he's a stickler for having clear, well-supported arguments and demonstrating your knowledge of the concepts involved. Overall, this class is a great one worth taking. I'm only not satisfied with my grade because confusing two very similar issues on the midterm probably will result in me getting as much as a grade lower for the term, but nonetheless, I learned a lot from the class and had a great time doing it.\"",

I strongly recommend this class for anyone interested in European or medieval history, as well as anyone who enjoys a well taught and stimulating history course. There is a lot of reading for the class, but for the most part it is interesting and covers important topics.

            "review 46: \"02S with Walter Simons: This is a very interesting class, taught by a very skillful professor. History Major/minor or not, if you like history at all, you should take this class. The readings are great, the lectures quite fascenating and the professor quite appealing. This class definitely inspired an interest in the subject-matter. The books for the class, when I took it, were: \"Confessions,\" by St. Augustine \"Holy Feast & Holy Fast,\" by Carolyn Walker Bynum \"Image on the Edge,\" by Michael Camille \"Medieval Europe: A Short History,\" by C. Warren Hollister & Judith M. Bennett \"The Letters of Abelard and Heloise,\" Trans. by Betty Radice \"The Muslim Discovery of Europe,\" by Bernard Lewis \"Christianity & Paganism from the Fourth to Eighth Centuries,\" by Ramsey McMullen \"The Formation of a Persecuting Society,\" by R. I. Moore The course requirements were (10% of grade) a 900 word essay on any one of the above books (due on the Friday that the book was discussed), (30%) a 2,500 word research paper (due on the last day of classes), the usual 10% for discussion section participation, 20% for the midterm, and 30% for the final. The midterm and final are both quite doable, if you're up to speed on the reading, and reviewed your lecture notes. It is best to do your short essay before the midterm (unless you see something on the syllabus later one, which really catches your eye), for there's a lot of work to do on the research paper after the midterm, and that's the time when your other courses start having stuff due. It is a good idea to come to Prof. Simons' office hourse to discuss your research paper. It is not required, but he is quite good at helping you pick your topic, narrowing it down, and guiding you through the paper.\"",
            "review 47: \"02S with Walter Simons: I did not know what to expect when i first signed up for this class. I was interested in history as a possible major; however, i had no direction or specific interest at the time. The first time I heard Professor Simons lecture, I knew that this was the class for me. He was funny, attentive to his students, used a variety of media to teach, and abided by a well organized sylabus. Even his lectures were organized and outlined clearly. But what struck me the most was his vibrant interest in the material. I didn't know that someone could be so passionate about medieval history! Needless to say, by the end of the term, I caught his 'medieval fevor' as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this class: it challenged me with the reading material, the ideas proposed in the lectures, the group discussions and the final essay. I looked forward to the lectures and to meeting with Prof. Simons on the side. All you history buffs and people interested in exploring something different, this is the course for you!\"",
            "review 48: \"02S with Walter Simons: Medieval intellectual and cultural history is really quite fascinating, regardless of the bad rep the period itself received during the Renaissance. The first half of the class was chronological; the second thematic. We explored everything from the evolution of Christian thought (Augustine, Abelard) to more esoteric topics (Carnival, mysticism). The readings themselves, which included Augustine's Confessions, were almost always very interesting and never overburdening. The class had lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, and discussions on Fridays. Discussions were not always of the highest quality, but that would be a minor complaint. Two exams, a long research paper, and a short book review - very reasonable. Professor Simons is really quite excellent: his lectures are well-organized and chock-full of interesting anecdotes, his office hours are generous, and he really is one of the nicest guys I've met. He takes your viewpoints very seriously during discussions, and I would also describe him as a very generous grader. Complaints? No mention of either Dante or Chaucer. Still, one can't cover everything. A rewarding and extremely interesting class overall, one that has impelled me to write a thesis with Professor Simons.\""

The class itself is definitely enjoyable for anyone who likes history. The final assignment, a research paper, allows you to focus on anything you've found interesting during the course. Other grades are a midterm and final (on the second half of the class) and either a short essay or presentation. There are readings for every class which can be quite long, especially as we read several books, one of which contributed to the majority of the final. My only, but still big, critique of the class is that its reverse classroom structure wasn't very effective. The combination of watching lectures, lengthy readings, and still meeting three times a week synchronously created much more work than there needed to be. The synchronous classes, which were meant for asking questions about the lectures, were not very effective at reinforcing material.

The first 1-2 weeks of background reading are a lot of material, but you do not at all have to read it very closely or in its entirety. After that, you just have to read around 30-50 pgs of the Lewis and Clark journals per class, mostly focusing on their encounters with Native Americans. Professor Calloway gives a lecture expanding on the readings, and then students bring up passages that they thought were interesting and he explains those. The lectures can get a little boring sometimes, but to be fair I took it as a 10A and 1.5hrs is a long time to be talked at. There is a midterm that is questions about the texts and lectures-- a few short answers and some more analytical content. The final is about the same, just longer. As long as you have a good conceptual understanding of the material and review the main events of the readings, the midterm and final are very doable and shouldn't require too much studying. There is also a final paper, which is supposed to be 7-10 pages I think? You do a research paper about the journals looking at them through any perspective, ex. some people focused on medicine, portrayal of Native American women, etc. Getting the paper and the final is kind of a grind but definitely not as bad as other classes I've taken in the department. If you're interested in Native American studies or American history I'd recommend it.\""

The course tackles radicalism from various perspectives ranging from questions on the place and identity that Africans brought with them to the New World, to the way their experiences both as slaves and as Freedmen effected their thoughts all the way to the periods after the Civil War down to the present day. Beginning with three terms for African-American Radicals: 1) Reformers; 2) Revolutionaries; 3) Emigrants we tackled and traced the roots of African-American thoughts through such well-known figures as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., while shedding light on less understood (and underappreciated figures in radical thought) Marcus Garvey, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Alphaeus Hunton, Ella Baker, and Fannie Lou Hamer. The strong force behind this class was not only based on the type of material we read, but also on the skills of Professor Wilder. He brought to the table a unique set of experiences, even entertaining our class with humor, while never losing the point of the class.

Despite having very little interest in the American healthcare system before taking the class, I can now say I have a better understanding of how it works and why it is the way it is than my parents, who have been dealing with (and even working in for a time) healthcare for years. Koop is incredibly insightful and really makes you think about healthcare from many perspectives. Two lectures each week and discussion on Friday. A lot of reading but it's doable and makes your life much easier in discussions and on exams. Exams are nearly impossible to finish on time, but Koop grades fairly and gives partial credit for half-thoughts scribbled at the last minute. Generally you'll do better than you think you did.\"",

Otherwise be prepared to show your knowledge of the readings/lectures in one midterm exam and one final paper. Make sure to talk to Koop in office hours, though.

This class opened my mind to an entire field of study that I hadn't even considered before, when I signed up I just thought that the class would be interesting and informative. As we got through the term, I found that I became so knowledgeable about the American health care system that I could definitely hold my own in any argument. There are two lectures per week, and a discussion section on Fridays. You're graded upon two midterms and a final paper, as well as participation in the discussion section.

As you might expect, a lot of it is focused towards historical trends from the 1600s to today, but Koop does a great job of outlining the current healthcare system as well. There are two textbooks (one historical-focused, one current-focused) as well as a series of additional readings (including a couple popular books). There are two midterms and a final paper which is basically a \"sum-up-the-course\", non-research paper (so don't stop doing reading after the second midterm!). The exams are very tough (involve identification, short answer, and a few fill-in-the blank and even statistical questions), but Koop is generous with partial credit/a curve and you always do better than you think you did. Be sure to keep up on the reading and you'll do OK, but this is a class you really have to work hard to get a good grade in. Koop is a great lecturer though, and he always manages to engage his students even on mundane topics. Instead of class on Friday you split up into discussion periods, which are fun. He brings in lots of interesting guest speakers and patient testimonials, which are surprisingly rewarding and educational. You'll learn a ton of material, some of which might literally save your life. A great class, strongly recommended-- especially if you NRO it!\"",

I found the other more modern books far more interesting and relevant to medicine today. I learned a lot in this course, yet sadly since the final paper was based on Starr's book, I felt much of the more interesting material was neglected. This is more a course to take if you are interested in how medicine has developed since the 19th century, if you are more concerned about the health care system today just buy the reading list without the course reader or Starr.\"",

Guest lectures were some of the best in the course - everything from patient perspectives to Dartmouth profs presenting their relevant research to former surgeon general Everett Koop telling his own story.

I must say that most science professors are blah - if I ever had a professor like Koop teach half as well in the sciences, I'd never leave school. He teaches the course very, very well - always interesting and engaging lectures - and it's not just teaching for a college course. The information you will take out of the class could impact you or someone you know someday. I especially loved the variety of guest speakers (including his dad, the former US surgeon general). They were fascinating and offered images into their real life experiences. People can talk in the abstract sense about healthcare in this country all they want - but when you actually hear someone share their life stories with you, it's moving. The readings are hefty - and I'll admit I didn't do all of it or come close, but you can pick and choose (B+G is key, as is Starr), plus the movies we watch almost every week kind of blanket the topic that week. The movies are amazing as well, and even if you don't take the course I recommend seeing them. That said, exams are tough. You've got to know a lot of stuff, but it's not so bad if you put some time into it (even if you didn't read everything). There is also a 12 page final paper that sums up the whole course... still working on that now so I don't know entirely how it's going to go. Take the course!

Koop brought in a diverse range of guest speakers (including Susan Wright, DHMC researchers, and even his dad, former Surgeon General C Everett Koop) to talk about different angles of the healthcare field. The class was highly demanding- Koop's lectures were fast paced and there was a ton of reading each week on both history and recent healthcare policy. The two exams were the most difficult I've ever taken- incredibly detailed questions on a vast amount of information that makes the tests almost impossible to finish. Triage is a necessary evil when it comes to choosing which materials to study (skip the films entirely, but obsess over everything else).

The material is interesting, though some of the technical details can get pretty dense (I guess because the healthcare system is so convoluted). To its credit, this class is one of the few humanities classes that actually has a practical application; I feel much more informed for the day when I need to choose an insurance plan or end up in the emergency room. Readings are overall good and movies are great. It is a lot of work, but manageable. As for the exams, yes, they are a bitch; however, no matter how badly you think you've done on them, the class is graded on a very friendly curve and Professor Koop always calculates final grades in your favor, if that makes any sense.

Why do doctors have (or have had) so much control? There is a bunch of reading, but the reading is diverse: from patient memoirs, to primary sources, to investigative articles, and movies of different time periods.

I knew almost nothing before and I now feel like an expert in the field. We attended two lectures and one discussion section each week. Professor Koop is an outstanding lecturer and his preparation seems unreal. He would write about sixty key terms on the blackboard before each class. He'd always reach the last term with about five seconds of alloted lecture time left, and he never appeared to speed up or slow down. He showed great enthusiasm and always kept the students interested. He invited wonderful guest speakers including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop (Professor Koop's father - an amazing man), biomedical engineers from Thayer, and survivors of disease. We also watched four entertaining films including The Madness of King George, Dr. Kildare's Strange Case, The Doctor, and Wit. We attended a discussion section once a week with the professor and 15 other students. These were very worthwhile, but gave us no choice but to stay on top of our large reading assignments. We also had online discussions during the week. History 36 was enlightening, but it was also unusually time-consuming. It required more work than any other course I've taken at Dartmouth. As a pre-med with difficult science courses, I found this to be very frustrating. Reading assignments were very large, although not as large as in Koop's other course, Europe in the Twentieth Century (History 53). Type \"History 36\" into Search on the Dartmouth homepage if you want to access the course's website and view the exact reading assignments. Although some of the readings (like Understanding Health Policy - make sure you read it carefully because Koop tests heavily on it) were very useful and interesting, some of them were extraordinarily useless and boring. Reading selectively made me uncomfortable because Koop tried to cover everything on his lengthy exams. Grading was based on a midterm exam, a final exam, a comprehensive final essay, and participation in the discussion sections and online discussions. The exams are VERY stressful. We had 65 five minutes to answer nine pages of short essay questions. I had very little time to organize my thoughts. Koop himself calls it a \"marathon\" in which students who truly know the material (and can write with extraordinary speed) are distinguished from the rest. After the first stressful midterm, Koop may tell the class that the final will be easier. It's not true: the final is just as difficult. The final essay question is very fair and covers most of the course. Koop asks for an essay of reasonable length, so it doesn't take forever to write. It provides students with an opportunity to organize what they learned and to increase their grades after the two difficult exams. In conclusion, this class is very worthwhile, but don't take it unless you're willing to invest a lot of time and effort in it.\"",

In the end, I thought the class was worthwhile and I'm glad I took it, but it wasn't as earth-shattering as I'd expected. The lectures are overall good, although some of the guest lecturers can be incredibly dull, and the readings, while dense, are very informative. Generally, though, I felt as though the course tried to do too much, what with movies, guest lecturers, a TON of reading, and discussion sections. He tries to make it a survey course and a senior seminar all in one, and I felt like coverage of the material tended to be spotty. I never missed a class, so either I just wasn't paying attention, or he really does jump around too much to give you a good sense of the broad themes of the course. The exams are extremely rough and he puts you in a serious time crunch, but his grading is fair and the challenge is a welcome one. This is not the best class in our amazing history department, but it's better than most courses in other departments.

Classes like this are why I came to Dartmouth--I didn't skip any, and judging from the full lecture hall, most of my classmates didn't either. The discussion sections were great. Because of the nature of the material we were studying, people could bring their own experiences and the experiences of their friends and family to the table. People were very engaged, and didn't just mumble a few requisite comments to prove that they had done the reading. There is a lot of reading. If you take this class, be prepared to work. The tests are very comprehensive (and insanely fast-paced) and at the end you have to sum up 204 years of history and argue a thesis in \"about 12 pages.\" This sounds like a lot of space, but it really isn't. You will find yourself asking your friends stupid questions like \"Do you think 16 pages is about 12 pages?\" before doing a lot of editing. Start early. Prof. Koop is tough, but he is allowed to be because he demands even more out of himself than he does out of his students. He is extremely well-prepared and well-informed, and he makes students a high priority. If you go to his office hours, you don't getting the feeling that he's looking at his books/research over your shoulder like someone eyeing a more attractive conversation partner at a cocktail party. If you have a question, but don't have time to visit him, he also (gasp) checks his blitz and answers it. Shocking, but true.\"",

The web page allows students to comment about class, discussions, readings, or other material that they've found relates to the class. Guest lecturers, including C.

Her lectures are amazing- they are paced out efficiently and are extremely organized. Her passion for this subject is so contagious that it is hard to find boring parts of the class. We had two midterms which were pretty straightfoward (advice: make sure you aggresively seek exactly what the prof. is looking for) and a research paper which was fun. The toughest part of the course was that the material was quite dense. Being that you are required to know pretty minute details for the exam, this makes her tests difficult. There is so much that we cover, which makes it hard determine what to focus on. But, as I discovered during the course of this class, it is best to be as straightforward with the prof. as possible about what you are unsure of- she will help in any way that she can w/out spoonfeeding you the answers, which, in my opinion, makes a good prof. a great one.\"",

Teaching is truly her first priority. Her lectures are clear, relaxing, and well-organized. She has a tremendous interest in both architecture and history, and she does all she can to inspire this level of interest in her students. The course had a midterm and a non-cumulative final exam. Both were fair, but challenging. For the midterm, we had only sixty-five minutes to complete 6-8 pages of essays. This year, the exams were based solely on her lectures. The moderately interesting textbook was used only to complement the lectures. This may be a fluke, so it would be wise to keep up with the reading, at least until the midterm. She assigns approximately two textbook chapters per week, but you may only want to read about the buildings, architects, and movements covered in class. She didn't include anything found only in the textbook on the exams. Although selective reading saves time, keep in mind that it is still a risk. Nevertheless, it is MUCH more important to take excellent notes during lectures, and to thoroughly study the notes and the class handouts for each exam. The handouts contain many obscure names and dates that you will have to memorize for the exam. Be prepared. She has assigned papers in the past, so I wouldn't be surprised if she does it again in the future. Overall, the course offers a great professor, interesting material, and a very reasonable workload.

However, this may seem over played, and I tried giving the class and the teacher a fair chance, but let's get really serious here -- as with all the LALACS courses I have the taken at Dartmouth, there is a tendency to present biased history and biased historiography. You can and do have objective history (by presenting all sides and opinions of an issue in a sourcebook or in the readings chosen), the historiography (how one interprets history) is supposed to be based on someone's opinion. However, this class presented a very slanted view on the history which only served to back up the already slanted/biased views of the professor and as such, that carried over into the historiography we were taught. In other words, while a lot of the issues we discussed were interesting, and had merit and validity, the fact that we never heard opposing arguments to what we learning, and the fact that the lectures consisted of the repetitive diatribe on race, ethnicity, class, and labor -- really did not contribute to the amount of learning that could have been done had we been given insightful objective well-rounded sources, and had our lectures been more dynamic.

As far as work goes, it is a hell of a lot of reading. Orleck acknowledges that she gives out way too much on syllabus day. My strategy was to just pick 1-2 readings out of the assigned ones for each class (and if there was a movie, even better) and then make my discussion post about that. That kept the workload manageable. The rest of your grade is leading discussions (you sign up for a few at the beginning of term, each with a partner, and then make slides with quotes and discussion questions -- it's pretty manageable) and a final research paper (for which you can write about basically anything related to the class). All in all I found the workload pretty manageable. In terms of grading, Orleck is a little bit of a black box -- she doesn't even have a grade breakdown by percentage on the syllabus. That said, she wants to give you an A if you're engaged in class and put in effort on your paper. She gives extremely extensive feedback on the paper drafts (like, I wrote 4000 words and she wrote 2000 words of feedback) and is available to meet in office hours to discuss your paper topic or how you're doing in the class. She literally wrote the book on a lot of this stuff, so she is quite useful in office hours. Don't fall behind on the discussion posts!! -- most people write around 600 words for each one, which is 12,000 words over the course of the term. They're super manageable if you do them on time (bc they can just be bulleted lists of your thoughts, they don't need to be well-written or revised, etc), but if you fall behind, you are sort of screwed. Class discussions were always interesting and Orleck herself participated a lot (again, she is like, the foremost authority on a good chunk of the course content) which meant the conversations never really reached an awkward silence. I recommend this class, particularly if you need a CI distrib!\"",
            "review 2: \"22S with Annelise Orleck: Great class!!! I found the material really interesting, and Orleck is a very engaging and supportive prof. The class is pretty reading-heavy (as are most history classes), as in you can expect like 100+ pages of readings per class. However, there are no reading quizzes or anything, and you mainly read to be able to contribute to in-class discussions. The class is almost all discussions with small groups of students (like 5-8), with Orleck providing a short intro. Students write the discussion questions, and different groups lead discussions every class. If you engage with the material, you will learn a ton of very interesting history and have great discussions with your classmates. There are also discussion posts on the readings due every class, though they don't need to be super long. Do not get behind on those, or they're really annoying to make up. Orleck is pretty chill and says herself that she doesn't really believe in grades, so you really just have to worry about engaging with the material, discussion posts, and your final paper. Yes it's 15-25 pages long, but it's doable. As someone who has never written such a long paper before, I was freaked the hell out, but Orleck is always available for office hours and recommends turning in drafts for feedback etc. I did not do a draft and I lowkey regret it. Do not wait until the last week of class to write the paper! Even if you have to sacrifice time to do the assigned readings, start your research for the paper early because you have to expand your topic way beyond the in class readings. The paper is a grind but it's very rewarding when you're done with it. Overall, awesome class and very chill except the final paper.\"",

Every class is a group led discussion - you get put into a randomly assigned group at the start of term, every student usually does a class led discussion 2-3 times throughout the term. There's 1-3 discussion posts per class, it just depends on the amount of readings with how many discussion posts are due. They're cumulative throughout the term, so as long as you get them done before finals it's fine, no hard deadlines. But would recommend not getting too behind on them just because it can be annoying to have to do 5 to 6 in a row on Sunday cuz you got behind. Although you can get away with not doing the readings for class, I would recommend doing just one at least, because some students solely talk about them and participation is required. Other students choose to do their discussion on broader topics that don't narrow on the readings, so if you usually do at least one reading you'll be fine. There's one final history paper that's ~20 pages, 25 page limit. Topic of your choosing as long as it coincides with what we talked about in class. It's long but Orleck is super great and will help guide you with he paper if you need the help.

Orleck is a compelling storyteller, and I can only imagine how differently I would look at the world if she were my high school teacher! Others in the class had some trouble finishing all of the reading (8 books plus a chunky reader), and I admit that it was difficult, but having taken no other history classes, I can't very well evaluate the amount of reading in comparison to other classes of its nature. One really did not want to come to class unprepared to discuss. The final paper was 25 pages, but Orleck provides lots of help (though be careful, because she might steer it in a direction you're not expecting!). Final presentations were given in class and at Orleck's home (a particularly wonderful aspect of the course). Students were required to keep a journal of the readings/class discussions. This was difficult, but VERY rewarding. There was plenty of room in the class for personal expression. If you take no other History or Women's Studies courses, this one is great.\""

That being said, I found the course to be less than I had hoped for. There was a LOT of reading (i.e. 10 books plus a reader that was over two inces thick) and a big final paper based on interviews you have to conduct yourself on a subject of your choice pertaining to american women's history (which I strongly suggest you start early and consult her about regularly). If you're one of those people who doesn't like to do the reading, you can probably BS your way through the class discussions (there's one almost every day, first in small groups and then as an entire class), but I wouldn't necessarily advise it because a huge part of your grade is based on participation. Orleck takes attendance everyday and knows everyone's name, so I wouldn't advise taking the class unless you are committed to going every day and making at least one semi-coherent statement during each class that seems almost relevant to the discussion taking place(given the intelligence of some of my peers' remarks, I would say that as long as your comments vaguely address 'oppression' or the 'multiple jeopardies' faced by women of other races, religions, classes, etc., you're golden) there are two other minor papers, neither of which you should lose any sleep over. all in all, I think this is really one of those classes that is what you make of it. If you're really into women's studies stuff (and this is more WGST than HIST in my opinion), this class will probably be right up your alley. Oh, and fair warning: there was only one guy (out of 30-something students) in the class.\"",

There's also time in every class for discussions, and she's great about learning everyone's name, even in a fairly large class. You have to put the work in (start on your research paper early), and it's a good idea to go in for office hours - she's very available for that and there was usually a small line of people waiting to speak to her - but if you do, I think you'll find it a really worthwhile class.\"",

The course met three days a week, with one day each for lecture, discussion, and student presentations, which actually worked a lot better than I expected. My only complaint about the course would be the structure of the assignments. Presentations are held throughout the term (for which we were never informed of our grades), and the paper and take-home final (which make up the three course requirements) are both due within the last week of the course, so you have virtually no idea how you're doing in the class or what kind of grade you'll be receiving.

These speakers did not have filters and you could ask them anything. This is a once in a lifetime class and such an important event in recent US history, don't turn it down.\"",

Easily the hardest course I took this fall, and I took a biol foundations class too. Workload was 1.5 hours of lecture and 40-100 pages of dense reading per class, sometimes replaced or augmented with a film or two. The only real way to cover all the lectures is to watch at 1.5x speed, which is manageable because Miller is a slowish talker. Readings were oftentimes kind of ramble - said in 40 pages what could have been 5, but you still had to read them all because one short section might be brought up in class. Classes were entirely discussion based and required a deep understanding and critical analysis of the material. Assignments: a 500 word, 1300 word, and 1500 word essay, and a 3000 word group essay. The writing itself was pretty quick for these, but drafting and finding evidence was super time consuming. Essays required a critical analysis of an outside source using material from class, which took a lot of work. Miller's grading was a little odd, too: you really had to interpret the sources the way he wanted you to. Definitely go to office hours for papers, though, because he'll steer you in a direction that he pretty clearly wants you to go. Generally a really rewarding class, if marred slightly by weird grading.\"",

I'm a senior history major and I took this class my sophomore fall. I've taken a shitload of history classes and the best ones are the ones that kind of force you to come to your own conclusions about historical events and figures. Professor Miller likes to tell you the \"right\" or the \"best\" answers. This class feels very high-schooly in the sense that you are essentially force-fed various value judgements about events and people. So I might recommend this course for a freshman. But if you are interested at all in the process of reading and writing history then I think I would take the historical pedagogy of this class with a grain of salt.

Instead, Miller has you read a ton of primary sources and then two or three competing interpretations by historians. And you'll spend all of class discussing which interpretation you think is right based on the evidence. So you're not just memorizing, you're actually thinking like a historian--developing critical evidence-based thought. It's one of the few classes I've taken that's literally made me smarter.

Even in large group discussions of up to 60 students, he managed to keep the topics discussed on track without limiting the debate. Think about how often in discussion sections a professor just calls on ten people in order, and then they go down the line saying their piece, not responding to what anyone else said. That never happens in Miller's classes. If you are debating between a class Miller is teaching and a class taught by someone else, unless that Professor's name is \"Koop\" or \"Wilder\" you should go with the Miller class.

Shewmaker, as a scholar and a lecturer, is a hard act to follow. He was incredible. However, in Miller, I was not disappointed AT ALL. In fact, Miller surprised me with his AWESOMENESS. Ed Miller is not only a young, energetic prof, (who hopefully will be here for years to come) but he is a rising scholar. The man has a VERY unique take on the Vietnam war, being of a later generation, and he brings to the equation an understanding of Vietnam and its language and history that VERY FEW if any American scholars possess. I was even surprised to discover that Miller also has a very insightful and even caring regard for those who lived through the war--stating that we need to understand that the American understanding of the war is based on collective memory, and collective memory always includes myth--yet myth always includes both truth and falsehood. I took this course for an interregional within the major, and I am so glad I did. I could not recommend this course higher. Nota Bene, however, that Miller is no easy grader. Your exam essay needs to have a very good argument. In this sense Miller is also a great prof--he holds you to a high standard. This is a very popular course among non-majors, but I also highly recommend it to majors, even non-Americanists. It's a phenomenal course. Take it.\""

The readings are for the most part boring and tedious (don't bother doing them), with the notable exceptions of the Powers and Bacevich books. Class discussion doesn't really exist in a lecture of 50 students, but the lectures are interesting and illuminating. Any student who has some background in international relations and is interested in perhaps pursuing this field really ought to take this class, which could double as a government class.

His essay assignments, perhaps a tad too numerous, nevertheless certainly guide students toward a thorough understanding and interpretation of the class material. As for negatives, I do wish Prof. Edsforth could stay on topic in his lectures a bit better, as he tends to go off on tangents, preventing him from covering everything that he could in class. And, a word of warning to conservatives thinking about taking this class: Edsforth is an out-and-out liberal, no doubt about it. He makes fairly controversial statements quite regularly in class, which most conservatives would tend to disagree with. So if you bristle at the slightest mention of anti-U.S. sentiment, do not take this class.

As the course progressed, I realized it had little to do with foreign relations at all. Instead, the course served as a means of getting across to young, impressionable minds the liberal intention of professor Miller: That everything about America is bad and false. Pure revisionist history - And a pure waste of time. The grading is as follows: 20 percent for discussion (for which you only receive credit if you agree with that professor), 10 percent for an easy 15 minute midterm matching quiz, 20 for a paper about the monroe doctrine or Liberia, 30 percent for another paper about anything in 'foreign relations' (be sure in this to emphasize American racism - Miller likes that a lot), and the last 20 on a final exam.

He focused on social history, the plight of the 1950s and 1960s housewife, the perils of urban sprall, and student activism.

The lectures are often powerful and difficult in the best way that history can be, and Darryl does not shy away from the difficulties of racism, segregation, and slavery. The class itself can get a little disorganized, often near the ends of terms, but you will certainly learn something new, be entertained, and think differently about the United States after even a single class with Darryl. Can't recommend him, or this class, enough.\"",
            "review 3: \"22W with Darryl Barthe: I would not recommend this course to anyone, because it was genuinely my worst academic experience at Dartmouth so far. I want to preface by saying the material itself was very interesting; the readings were generally pretty engaging, if not a bit too long, and the material covered in the lectures was fascinating. However, this was overshadowed by Prof Barth\u00e9's teaching style. Prof Barth\u00e9 was extremely curt and impersonal. I always felt nervous to participate in class, and could tell that others felt that way too because our in-class discussions felt forced and uncomfortable, likely because Prof Barth\u00e9 would often shoot down comments with which he didn't exactly agree. He did not shy away from individually calling out students, which I do not think fostered a productive and comfortable environment. Prof Barth\u00e9 is also a bit boundary-pushing in his teaching, which is necessary, to some extent, in covering the realities of civil rights in the United States; however, I think he completely crossed the line in some of his comments and assertions, and was particularly off-put by his cavalier use of slurs during our lecture on the queer rights struggle. I also strongly disagree with the way Prof Barth\u00e9 graded assignments. On papers, he was incredibly strict and his comments could be, in my opinion, inappropriately harsh without being constructive; he definitely valued structural/format specifics of papers over the actual content of those papers, which is the polar opposite of every professor I've had at Dartmouth. He was also not receptive to discussing grade qualms or questions in office hours. I have always considered myself a strong writer, but in this course I got two of the lowest grades I've ever gotten on papers. It felt like no matter how much effort I put into the class, including going to supplemental x-hour meetings to explicitly work on my papers, I couldn't seem to satisfy his requirements and earn grades I was truly proud of. This class was very stressful and draining for me, and I personally really wouldn't recommend it; I felt that the Prof made it impossible for me to find my stride or find any payoff for all my efforts in the class.\""

Delmont is super passionate about the course, and he's a great lecturer and facilitator of discussion. 75 percent of the work in the class is graded for completion. 25% came from daily reading checks that ask broad questions about the reading (readings range from 50-120 pages per class, but he doesn't use the x hour). The questions are open ended, so you have to actually do at least some of the reading so you can talk about material from it, but they aren't specific enough that you could possibly do the reading and not do well. 50% of the grade comes from the responses on contemporary and historical sources you find related to each book you read. You do one historical and one contemporary source response about every week and a half, once the class is finished with the book. We had five books, so ten responses total. Final 25% is an 8-10 page paper where you find 4 books on one more specific topic that fits the theme of US Civil Rights, and you compare the books' arguments.

Professor Butler did a great job lecturing and selecting readings. We had about 20-30 pages of reading after most classes, two 4-6 page papers, and a midterm & final. Reading quote identification questions were on both exams, so doing the reading was mandatory. In total, I probably spent 5-6 hours per week on the reading, an extra 5 hours studying on exam weeks, and an extra 20-25 hours writing on paper weeks. So this class was not a layup, but also fairly moderate in workload. I found the content of the course quite interesting - we examined how Americans thought about the world and major issues during the 1700s and 1800s mainly by reading and analyzing primary texts (newspaper articles, books). At first I was worried that the old texts would be boring and hard to read, but they turned out to be easy to read and interesting. For example, we examined anti-slavery and pro-slavery arguments. I would recommend this class more except that I found the Professor Butler\u2019s topics for the two papers to be vague; I had trouble understanding what the professor wanted. The Professor also was very reluctant to give example essay topics/ thesis. I think part of the problem was that this was my first history course and I did not have a good idea how to form history thesis. Since these essays were a big chunk of the course grade, not understanding what was wanted in the essays had a substantial negative impact on my grade and my enjoyment of the course.\"",

The course is incredibly organized, with nightly readings perfectly supplementing lectures. The essays are challenging in a fun way, which I definitely can't say about any other class. The only down side is that her midterm and final have a quotation section, which makes studying stressful.

I did the readings about half the time and while they definitely made the lectures more interesting you could get by without always doing them. Grading consisted of class participation, 3-4 discussion posts that were due at the end of every week, two class debates and a final paper due at the end of the term. As long as you did some of the readings or took notes during the discussion it was pretty easy to bang out a discussion post in like half an hour. The debates were super easy to prepared for, every student read a bio and short speech written from the perspective of their historical figure. The actual debate portion was usually only like ten minutes long at the end of the class. Orleck was great to talk to in office hours and will reward you with a good grade (likely an A) as long as you show up to class and turn in your assignments on time. The final paper which is about 15-25 pages will require a decent amount of time so try to get started early. She will leave like hundreds of comments on your first draft so the real work is going back through and adding sources/expanding where she asks you to. Definitely take this class if you're looking for a fun/interesting history course.\"",

I would honestly call it a layup relative to other courses at Dartmouth because there are no exams and Professor Orleck will reward you with a good grade (likely an A) as long as you put time and effort in. The workload consisted of a significant amount of reading (but we weren't tested on it and Prof. Orleck didn't expect us to read it all - I personally tended to set aside a 1.5 - 2 hours before each class period to do the reading and discussion post), a daily discussion post, two debates that each student participated in over the term, and two mini-lectures. The final was a 15-25 page research paper on any topic from 20th century U.S. history of our choosing, which is easier than it sounds because students pick topics that interest them and, rather than nitpick, Prof. Orleck reads the paper holistically for its general historical argument, inclusion of primary and secondary sources, and historical narrative / storytelling ability. We submitted a draft week 7 or week 8 to get her feedback. History 19 would be a good class any term, but especially if you have two other demanding classes, are in a four-course term, or looking for a sophomore summer class. Also, don't get stressed based on the reading list - we read excerpts from each book and many of the books are on reserve in Baker-Berry, so I would recommend only buying the ones that interest you and borrowing others.\"",

This time Prof. Edsforth changed his grading though so that 30% was on weekly quizzes 20% was on participation and 50% was on the final paper. Beware because I've taken classes with weekly quizzes before and they were very fair, Professor Edforth's quizzes are NOT. Many people in the class (including myself) did all of the reading and still could not get perfect scores on all or many of the 5 question quizzes. Also, discussions are mostly lecture and he asks narrow questions really just looking for the few words he wants. The final paper is an odyssey, start it early if you still want to take this class after reading this review.

The midterm is ID-ing ten terms from a list of three pages that he gives you. You also have two 5 page papers over the term which was fine.

This is one of those courses you need to take because it provides you with invaluable perspectives on the world - the kind of thing that will stick with you for the rest of your life and help you to become a better critical thinker when it comes to historical/political events. The workload was entirely reasonable: two five-page papers out of a choice of three, each of which is based on a book, so you basically just read it and distill their arguments into your own paper. Additionally three was a one-hour midterm and final of short-responses, plus a short, hand-written essay for the final. If you know how to read and write, this course is really fucking easy. I have recommended this course to basically everyone who would let me talk about it. Take it.\"",

I was taking it as an NRO so I could actually listen and learn -- it was a really interesting new perspective on American history and colonialism. Challenged a lot of the rote west-centric history I'd been fed in high school. Work for the course: two papers, a midterm, and a final. Decent amount of reading every week -- the textbook (written by Calloway) is basically what he said in lecture, with some documents (READ THESE: they are on the exams). A few other books are assigned -- skimmable (which you definitely need to do if you're writing a paper on that topic). Overall: Calloway is helpful, responsive and flexible with the assignments. Great class. You'll learn a lot without realizing it...\"",

Class is big enough to bring computers and not pay attention if need be, but he's got a sweet British accent and it's kinda fun to listen to. He goes through about 3 pages of hand written notes a day, basically just a bunch of people, places and treaties that are all fair game for the midterm. We had to pick 2 out of 3 1500 word papers to write, which were fairly simple becuase there was a book and movie about all three, so it was easy to put together a 5 pager. The midterm was tough, it's only 10 ID's, but he throws some random ones in and if you haven't taken good notes you'll probably have no idea who they are. The final was the same with the ID's as the midterm, then an essay question that was really broad and it wasn't hard to answer, it was just hard to think of how to organize it and make it sound coherent. Overall, good course, would recommend it as a 3rd class for a semi-easy, but interesting class.\"",

He often has personal anecdotes about many of the tribes that the class learns about, which makes the lectures especially interesting. While there is little to no required work on a weekly basis, it is definitely important to go to class. Many people take intensive notes, but I didn't find that necessary. Calloway provides a full list of each term that might show up on exams (which consist of ten identifications of these terms and an essay), so it is easy enough to simply go down the list and make sure you know each one. Definitely take this course whether you are a history major or not. It will turn everything you thought you knew about American history and Native American relations on its head.\"",

You really do need to go to class though because everything that is on the exams is discussed in class and is not necessarily as in depth as you will want in the textbook.

It's also not super challenging material, but in retrospect, I feel like I learned more than I realized at the time.

A lot of the material is disturbing, and very personally relevant to students into the class and to the history of our nation. However, Professor Calloway manages to present the material that is instructive and insightful about the wars, changes and suffering that occurred, but does not censure or cast blame in a way that would blind us to seeing all sides. This approach requires a lot of subtlety, thought and care, and I think the professor handled it very well. Professor Calloway combines organization with the note-free manner of a good storyteller. He does not rush through to fit in as much material as possible, but rather speaks with pauses and repetitions as a good presenter does, to allow the listener to think about and absorb what he is hearing.

Your grade is based entirely on a midterm, final, and a 15-page term paper, so it got pretty stressful at the end of the term.

This review comes from a pretty average student who is a history major. First and foremost this class is best described as average. Prof. Culbert knows what she's talking about, but that doesn't mean you will by the end of the class. I mean this when I say this- i have NEVER been in a less organized class in my life. Sure there is a syllabus, but it is oragized into weeks which leads to confusion about what readings are supposed to be done when and more importantly what you're going to be learning on any given day in class. We seemed to bounce around from topic to topic and I never fully grasped the layout of the course. The lectures are pretty standard but I felt that her voice just made me want to sleep a lot. Also, the Civil War is a pretty well known topic and so you get every Tom, Dick, and Harry in the class who thinks they should be writing the next book about Gettysburg. The most aggravating aspect of the whole class, however, was the grading. Now maybe my opinion stems from the fact that I feel I got screwed on my paper, but I will tell you what I mean. I wrote a paper about the importance of a certain battle, and just because Prof. Culbert didn't think it was as important as I argued she gave me a bad grade, even though my points were backed up by legitimate quotes/ sources. I am not saying this to complain, but I think a Prof. should put personal biases aside when grading and simply grade on the presentation of an argument. The fact that she disagreed with me should never have even come into play. To sum it all up- this is a very average class with an average Prof. I can say that it is the worst history class I have taken during my major, and that sucks because I was really pumped to take this class to begin with.

Before the term, I read reviews of Culbert warning that she was bad but decided to ignore them. First of all, Culbert is not even a professor and works at Parkhurst as Wright's assistant. She is extremely boring. She sucks all life out of what is one of the most interesting topics in American history. She spends time on the wrong issues. She spent nearly half of the class on Antebellum America and in doing so, she did not give important battles and the aftermath of the war proper attention. She assigns incredible amounts of reading. She assigned biographies on Grant, Davis, and an account on Gettysburg -- the three of which were 500-700 pages and this is just a sampling of the 1000 pages or so that was assigned each week. The reading will inform you about specifics of the war but since there is so much, you will likely neglect most of it, as it is not essential to the course and examinations. Finally, Culbert answers every question and is willing to discuss interpretations with different students in class. While some might see this as admirable, I found it distracting and these tangents made it more difficult to get through the amount of relevant material. All in all, I found that the class (mainly the professor) was extremely dissapointing. It is not hard to get a decent grade, however - a B+/B.\"",

I found that this course provided little new information besides the basic facts that nearly every American student gets in high school American history. Prof Culbert is very well versed in Civil War scholarship, but her lectures are highly disorganized and random. She is a wonderful person and inspires excitement for the subject matter - but I found myself continually disappointed with the very simple presentation of Civil War history.\"",

However, Culbert makes it even better. A lot of reading is assigned, but you don't really have to do it all. A paper about one of the books is required at the end of the term, so you should read at least one of them. I would suggest going to class b/c that's the material the exams are based on. Quizzes and exams are not tough at all, and they are based on the material covered in class. Overall, the class is great, the prof is engaging, and the exams are not hard.\"",

I regret that a little now because the readings (mostly biographies of persons involved in the Civil War) look really interesting. This is a good survey course of the Civil War for anyone who is interested. Culbert covers all aspects and themes and does so in an orderly manner. She's really interested which makes her students really interested. And she likes to open things to dicussion, which isn't easy in a class of approximately 70. The evaluation reminded me a lot of high school. Even though I didn't do half the readings, I still got by fine--the quizzes and exams were very straightforward. And the only paper was a book review of one of the biographies. This class comes recommended but I would suggest it more for someone who's interested in checking out the Civil War--not for a hardcore war buff or a serious history major.\""

Some days required 30 pages, other day 100 pages or more, so try to space it out if you can. Although, if you pay attention during lecture, it is not necessary to do ALL of it. Skimming should be fine. Also, exams could be pretty detail-oriented, especially with locations and maps, so keep an eye on those.

Otherwise, maybe check out Daniell's History of New England course next spring! I heard that is fantastic as well.\"",
            "review 4: \"01F with Jere R.: This class was interesting, and it fulfilled a number of a distributive requirements that I hadn't completed. Professor Daniell gave interesting lectures and the majority of the material on the tests came, at least indirectly, from his lectures. Thus attending class was extremely important, while the voluminous reading proved somewhat unnecessary. I'd suggest reading it selectively, but it tends to emphasize a lot of the specifics that which are not important for the tests that stress the more general stuff that's discussed in class. Sadly, Professor Daniell will not be around much longer (he's retiring in the very near future, like at the end of this year) to impart his incredible about the American Revolution, and specifically the events of the revolution in New Hampshire. As an alum, he did a great job of mixing interesting facts about the college's involvement in New Hampshire politics prior to the revolution and during the war period itself. His book, which was part of the reserve reading, turned out to be the most interesting read in the class, and I wish that it'd been on the required list instead of some of the stuff that I picked up at the bookstore and left untouched. A full half of the class grade is determined by the final research paper, which I'm currently in the process of writing. If nothing else, the class will likely force you to avail yourself of the primary resources in Rauner Library, which is something that I'd never done (and based on the sparse crowd in there it would appear that few other people have either). The project is very self-directed, and the freedom to do what you want makes the projecting more fun and simultaneously much more daunting. I really enjoyed the research process, but I had trouble stopping my research and beginning the writing process. This problem wasn't helped by the fact that Professor Daniell has a very flexible deadline for the paper that allows for the maximum amount of procrastination. Overall, I think the project was a very positive experience, let's hope Professor Daniell has the same positive experience in grading it.\"",

In truth, I found Daniell to be only a fair professor. I had a very tough time staying awake in class--partly because he didn't arouse much interest in the subject, and also because his lectures often verged on being incoherent. He would begin to articulate a thought, and then diverge into another topic all the time. However, he is very intelligent and very knowledgeable about the Revolution. The tests are fair--you must know the lectures and do most of the readings, and then you'll be prepared. He takes the papers more seriously though; get in a first draft early.\"",
            "review 7: \"01F with Jere R.: History 11 is a fairly interesting course. The lectures are chock full of information, but at times, are fairly disjointed. Part of the reason for this is because Professor Daniell knows way too much stuff. He even spent 3 years dealing only with ratification of New Hampshire's state consititution. The exams are fairly difficult too. The best answers are those that aren't pure facts, but those that are arrived at with common sense. For example, Daniell won't ask you: \"Who did this and why?\" Instead, he'll ask something like \"Who was affected by event X?\" You won't learn this in class, but you'll have to extrapolate the information from reasoning, the notes, and the reserve readings. The paper is worth 50% of your grade, and you can submit as many drafts as you want. Beware though: students have been known to remain at Dartmouth until mid/late December finishing this gargantuan task. Botttom line: Daniell is an interesting man and a Dartmouth fixture. He's written about State Constitutions, New Hampshire history, and Dartmouth history. He graduated here in 1955, and his dad graduated in 1922. He's seen it, done it, and lived it all. He's outsurvived Zeta Psi, Beta, and Phi Delt as well. This man is a legend here: While this class is pretty difficult, he does say some pretty interesting tidbits about Dartmouth and life in general (and he LOVES to talk about McCullough's biography on John Adams).

History is not a set of facts and people that you have to learn and know and memorize. History is the ever-changing discussion and debate between historians at all levels (including undergrad students!) about the circumstances, context, ideas, forces, and power structures of the past. Bethany Moreton is a phenomenal history professor, as history SHOULD be taught at a college level. She teaches you how to join the conversation, and create new opinions that are wholly your own. It's not enough to just learn about other historians' ideas, to truly learn history you have to be able to create and support your own. If you're genuinely interested in history and potentially majoring/minoring in history, take a class with Professor Moreton. If you just want to take a random history class where you learn facts and memorize stuff that probably happened (please open your mind to actually thinking your own thoughts if this is you) take Vietnam War with Professor Miller.\"",

            "review 1: \"23X with Stefan Link: Take this class!!! The material is so fascinating and was similar to WHAP/APUSH topics but with more of an economic spin. If you are an econ major, this class is very similar to Comin's Econ 22 course, going a bit more into the history of the rise/fall of certain country's economies. Professor Link is very knowledgeable about the topic and definitely showcases this during class. His lectures are very engaging and he is usually willing to go into more depth during office hours. This summer, the course was shortened, so we had three quizzes (30% each) and participation (10%). There are 2 lectures a week and one discussion class that is based on a couple readings (70-100 pages total) that took me about 2-4 hours the night before. If you really do the readings, attend the lectures and take diligent notes, the quizzes are fairly simple and straightforward. I often ended up copy and pasting my notes and forming them into sentences. I never actually participated in class, but attended some office hours and managed to collect the participation points. Perfect sophomore summer class, but it does have an A- median.\"",

If you're in any way curious about why the world economy is the way it is -- why there are rich and poor countries, why some countries grow while others stagnate, why and how the industrial revolution happened in the first place -- this class will give you a lot of answers and a lot of food for thought. This summer the class was condensed because Professor Link ended the class after Week 8 (he is on leave for a year starting this fall), so the reading load for some weeks was heavier than usual, but once the course goes back to using the full ten weeks the workload should be back to normal. Grading is based on three online, open-book, short-answer quizzes based on the readings; these were relatively easy to do well on as long as you did the readings and understood them.\"",

The readings are really manageable, and we didn't have a final, which was so nice. Your grade is determined by participation and four quizzes that cover the readings. This is a great class if you're interested in the global economy in any way and want something pretty chill. Prof Link obviously loves what he teaches, and it's fun to learn from him.\"",
            "review 4: \"22X with Stefan Link: This is a really interesting class and you will definitely learn a lot if you attend the lectures. For those looking for an easy A, however, your grade is based on four quizzes. Each quiz is worth 100 points, but the highest score Professor Link will give out is a 94/100. Essentially, you need \"perfect\" scores on all four quizzes to get an A in this class. An A- is super manageable though especially since the grade is 10% participation. Just know this is not one of those classes with an A median.\"",

Over an entire week, it's about 70 pages worth of reading you're expected to do. And, it's actually worth doing because the course every week is 2 lectures (no time for questions during them) M/W and then 1 discussion class of readings every Friday. The readings are then your primary tool too in assessment: 4 essay quizzes (1:15hr long) every 2-3 weeks on ONLY that material chunk. No final, just 4 quizzes very predictable questions. If you prepare well, no reason to not get full points. Great course, manageable workload, and extremely interesting.\"",

There would be two days of lectures then a day that was a discussion section about the readings assigned for the week. On average the readings took about 3 to 4 hours a week, but faster readers could probably get through them in closer to 2-3 hours. Professor Link is amazing and extremely approachable. He'll answer any questions you have in class and is great at explaining the topics covered in class. At the end of each class, he always thanked us for coming out for the 9L which was a small, but appreciated thing. The midterm was done in class and wasn't that bad. The final was the exact same format as the midterm and only covered the second half of the class. There were two short papers as well that weren't too bad. Overall, this was an excellent class that anyone interested in history or economics, or who just wants to know more about why our world is set up the way it is, should really take.\"",

I highly recommend this course even if you're not an Econ major, I feel like this is basic knowledge that'll help me later\"",

Professor Link is definitely very knowledgeable about the material, and knows how to run a discussion group for the readings (making zoom less awkward). Although I did well in this class, I took this class with my only prior econ background being econ 1, which meant the readings which were not super technical (but still kinda technical) were hard for me to fully grasp. After taking more econ classes since then, I have gotten a significantly more well rounded/deeper perspective on the material covered throughout the class. Overall the more econ background you have, the more you will get out of this class. That being said, I would still highly recommend this class to everybody.\"",
            "review 9: \"20S with Stefan Link: For an online class for the first time, I think Prof. Link did an incredible job of managing material and balancing expectations. Class is pretty much as advertised, covering evolutions and revolutions in the world economy from the 1800s to modern day (mainly with a focus on US and Europe, but some other details spliced in as well). Particularly interesting were the units on WW1/WW2 and the Gold Standard. Overall, the class was divided into two week segments, with an open-note essay test at the end of each (combination of short and long essays, given 4 hours to complete). Link was an engaging lecturer and found great ways to get class discussion going. Overall, incredible prof and if you're an Econ student looking for an INT distrib., this is pretty good to do.\"",

I took it online in 20F; there were 4 \"quizzes\" (only form of assessment) that we took every 2-3 weeks, which was helpful to retain info since the class covered a long span of time. There were 2 lecture classes a week and 1 discussion class. Would highly recommend.\"",

There is about 8-10 hours of reading assigned per week and a weekly discussion section for which all the reading is due, but the workload is otherwise not too bad. There is an hour-long midterm covering the first half of the course and an hour-long final covering the second half; one paper due before the first midterm; and a second paper or presentation option. The Multiple Choice questions with a twist can be tricky, but Prof Link gives partial credit and grades reasonably. I would just recommend that students base their papers as much as possible on factual analysis from the readings because Prof. Link likes that.\"",
            "review 12: \"19S with Stefan Link: This class is absolutely fantastic, so much so that it pushed me to actually write a review here. Prof. Link is one of the nicest, most passionate professors I have had during my time at Dartmouth. Not only is he clearly inspired by the material, but he is also open to questions, ranging from general to the mechanics of something like the gold standard in office hours once a week, or after class if you catch him. The course surveys 200 years of global economic history from the \"cotton empire\", to both world wars, the welfare state, and 2008 financial crisis. The readings assigned are well-chosen, but will only give you anything more than an idea of the issue at hand if you engage with it deeply; for me, this meant taking 2 hours or so to read a 20 page paper, highlighting terms and ideas I didn't understand and then going to Link during office hours to discuss. The course is designed to reward those who like learning about economic history, meaning that if you are interested in the material and do the readings, you will do very well. There are two non-cumulative midterms with 10 MCQs and 5 IDs of terms in the readings and lectures (these are rather obvious and Link signposts them, so doing well is not hard). Bottom line is: Link isn't trying to trip you up but just verify that you are learning and recalling key ideas, which is exactly what a survey course should aim to do. If you are an Econ major, Hist major, or simply care in the slightest about the foundations of the modern economy, this class is an absolute must at Dartmouth. By far the most efficient, curated way to get a primer on the origins of the world economy, without any undue pressure.\"",

I took this at the same time as Marjorie Rose's Macro class (Econ 22) and the two complemented each other nicely. This class is simple, but not easy. There are 2 midterms and 2 papers (or can do a presentation instead of 2nd paper). The caveat with the midterms is that they have a multiple choice \"with a twist\" section, where it could be 1 or 2 correct answers. Professor Link is a pretty good lecturer and I enjoyed the course.\"",
            "review 14: \"16W with Stefan Link: Grade was based on two exams, two papers (the second of which could optionally be exchanged for a poster/ppt presentation), and participation in class discussions. Both exams had the same format: half multiple choice questions and half IDs (if you're unfamiliar with history exams, as I was before taking this class, IDs are short ~1 paragraph descriptions of some item e.g. term, figure, quote). Readings are assigned weekly, and there were about 150-200 pages/week of somewhat dense articles/chapters written primarily by historians/economists. I was able to do well in the class without doing all of the readings very thoroughly, as Prof. Link did a great job of conveying the important material (i.e. relevant for exams) in lecture. He is a very engaging lecturer and I enjoyed my time in class. Coming from an economics background I didn't think this class was easy, but it was rewarding and it definitely didn't hurt that it helped me knock a few distribs out of the way!\""

He gives very effective lectures (if you can manage to stay awake through a 10A period) and assigns rather general writing assignments to allow for creativity. That said, the course itself, Eco's Echoes, is pretty dense. It is a VERY specific look at medieval monasticism through the medium of two historical novels by Umberto Eco and several scholarly texts on the subject. I took the course thinking that the reading would be enjoyable since I generally love historical novels, but Eco is not Michael Shaara. The readings were usually painful, and writing about them was sometimes very difficult. I recommend taking this course if you have a specific interest in medieval cultural history or religion in general. But if you're hoping for a term of holy-grail seeking, drawbridges and moats, or Crusading, you're in for a surprise.\"",

Consequently, if you put the requisite efforts into the assignments, Professor Simons definitely returns the attention. I never had a problem with any of the papers, but from what I understand, he was very understanding about some of the topics and was very lenient with the corrections. Also, whenever I contacted him via blitz, I always received a quick and adequate reply. If you are interested in the material, I definitely recommend taking a class with Simons.\"",

            "review 5: \"07F with Walter Simons: There are some inconsistencies in the SA reviews that I thought were unfair. First, the only reason that the professor took so long to return the papers back to the students were because he gave extensive feedback. I never thought that any professor would have the time and dedication to fill the margins with comments, good or bad, but I was proven wrong. Second, the professor was readily available outside of class. Some blitzes were returned with detailed suggestions within literally minutes of being sent. Medieval monasticism may not be everyone's cup of tea, but having a professor that is actually passionate and knowledgeable about the material makes all the difference.\"",

The professor was very nice and available outside of class, and a great help in helping us get started and giving us ideas for the research project. I'd say the only two downsides to the class were that there was a huge amount of reading and the Prof wasn't great about handing papers back on time.

His knowledge of the Middle Ages - both in breadth and depth - is incredibly impressive, and when he would share it with us class was a great pleasure. However, much of the class consisted of 10-20 minute research presentations by fellow students on topics vaguely related to Umberto Eco's book \"The Name of the Rose.\" These were incredibly boring, as the students presenting usually didn't have command of their topic (I know I did the research for mine in about 30 minutes, for instance) and the other students in class didn't really care. None of the material presented ever shows up again, whether it is from a student presentation or a lecture of Simons'. But at least Simons' lectures are interesting. Also, Simons' was not very effective at leading class discussion, and often we were left to flounder and get off track. He is a much better lecturer than seminar leader. The workload for the class is as follows - 4 papers, 3 of them are 3-4 page analysis assignments, and one is a final 9-10 page research paper. Much less writing than I have heard about in other horror story freshman seminars, but there is a lot of heavy reading about religious sects and the Catholic Church. The reading was never discussed until after the papers on it were handed in, so if you didn't grasp the material initially you were in trouble. Also contributing to the general problem of this class was in Fall '05 it was offered as a 10A - try to get a 2A as your freshman seminar; your life will be so much better for it. Simons is a great professor - but be warned, this class is not about general medieval history, but about a very specific topic within it: medieval monasticism.

The readings are pretty interesting: two of them are novels and not textbooks which was nice. It is not fun, however, to read large novels in a week. The essays are shorter than those in a lot of the other seminars, and they are graded pretty fairly. It is very difficult to get an A on a paper, but not hard to get a B. I'd reccomend this seminar over most of the others.\"",

That is how well Prof. Simons is suited for this course--and he even said that he'd spent time in a monastery in his youth before deciding that that wasn't the life for him. Anyway, the ORC has the requirements right on, but disregard the rest as BS because the only topic of this course is religion in the Middle Ages, especially as it pertains to monastic orders and the monastic system. You can go off on almost any tangent for the final research paper, but the topics of the other papers are as follows, in order: comparing _The Name of the Rose_, the book, to _The Name of the Rose_, the movie; explaining the conflict between different monastic orders; and examining the situation of the lower classes back then and in Eco's novels. Be sure to include proper citations, a bibliography, page numbers, and a title, too. The hidden bonus to this course is that two-thirds of the way through, you pretty much stop having regular classes and instead just go in to meet individually with the prof about your research paper. You definitely shouldn't use this as an excuse to slack off, though, otherwise you're either going to be working through Thanksgiving break or frantically trying to get everything done in the last few days of the term.\"",

However, instead of simply enjoying the class, I was blown away. I learned much more than I thought I would, and was greatly challenged as well. This course has a lot of reading, but luckily two of the books we had to read were novels, and the other two, Medieval Monasticism, and The Pursuit of the Millenium were good reads as well. If anyone is vaguely interested in monks and mysteries and church history, and the apocalypse/end of the world they should definitely take this seminar.

Take it! Prof Simons is also AMAZING and can translate medieval latin faster than any person I've ever met...he knows many other languages as well.

David: First of all -- Lagomarsino is a GREAT prof: his lectures are interesting and funny, he's always available outside of class, and he cares about you as a student and expects high-quality work out of you! This class doesn't have midterms or finals but 4 main papers and little side homeworks. 3 of the papers are pretty short - 1,000 words, but 1 is a research paper of about 3,000. This is standard first year seminar workload though, as far as the writing goes. The research paper is choose-your-own-topic, and you get PLENTY of time to research for it and finish it, with lots of guidance in the middle. Just a little warning: The reading for this course can be very heavy. Some of it is even in Old English, which gave me trouble, but those are very rare, most are modern texts and novels. The readings are really interesting for the most part, but the sheer amount of work will mean that you will have to be vigilant about reading and keeping up. Although the reading is heavy, this course really teaches you all the historical background and nuances of the Spanish Armada, and the classes are never boring, AND it teaches you how to be a good writer and will prep you for the rest of your years at Dartmouth, writing-wise. If you can, DEFINITELY sign up for it -- it has so far been the best class I've taken at Dartmouth, and I'm really lucky that I got placed into such an excellent seminar in the fall. if you don't get into this class, still try to take a class with Lagomarsino -- he's a stellar prof, and in my opinion one of the very best out of the history department and the entire College.\"",

Not only does he know the material like the back of his hand (he is cited by one of the authors we read; they went to grad school together), he is also avuncular and very approachable.

However, he is aware of this and front-loads the class so you won't have as much to read when your other classes start picking up.This isn't too much of a problem usually, as most of the texts are very engaging. Furthermore, some of the readings can be skimmed without too much consequence--we go over each book in discussion anyways. He is a fair grader, and offers good advice that can definitely improve your writing if you choose to take them.

He does his job, and he does it well. I would definitely recommend going to office hours, as I think that that is where he does some of his best teaching. My only wish is that he lectured more. Lagomarsino knows a lot (no, everything) about the subject and about writing, and I would have appreciated hearing his opinions on good writing. I highly recommend taking this class.

As such, he structured the course to give us a broad overview of history as a discipline as well as to introduce us to the library. We visited Rauner and embarked on a challenging, but informative, research exercise that took us all around the library. I really enjoyed the class. He's a fantastic teacher and an expert in his field (he's mentioned in the introductions of some of our books and he's in contact with some of the authors).\"",
            "review 5: \"09F with P. David: Prof Lagomarsino's the man, straight up. Is literally an authority on the subject...one of the books read in the class is dedicated to him. He's considered one of the leading experts on King Philip II of Spain's (awful) handwriting. This guy is literally a pro. I came in interested in English history and Queen Elizabeths defeat of the armada, not caring at all about the Spanish...that all changed. Lagomarsino just knows it all, and well enough that you can't help but ask more questions. The course is a ton of work though. 500 pages of reading over a weekend is not uncommon, especially early on in the term. There are three 1,000 word essays, a 3,000 word term paper, and a ten minute presentation. This on top of reading. It can get overwhelming; I didn't actually finish any of the assigned books. But all-in-all, this is a super course. He is super demanding with your writing, but he accepts rewrites for full credit, so you get a chance to incorporate his comments. Basically, put the work in, and you'll get a good grade. Procrastinate on the readings, and especially on the papers, and your life will suck.\"",
            "review 6: \"09F with P. David: This class is the reason that you came to Dartmouth. It is not easy. You will spend inordinate amounts of time reading and writing and rewriting, and in the end you will probably get the lowest essay grades you have ever gotten. It can be frustrating at times, but when that happens, Lagomarsino is always there to help. Lagomarsino simply makes this class. He is a great lecturer (though he rarely lectures in class), inspires real interest in the subject, and facilitates meaningful discussions. He can take a subject that you might not have any particular interest in and make you actually enjoy reading hundreds of pages on Early Modern Europe. He was always available outside of class, and really gave meaningful advice on essays, the term paper, and Dartmouth in general. Conclusion: Take this Seminar. It is a lot of work, but you came to Dartmouth to learn, not to be babied. If you are willing to put in the time, Professor Lagomarsino will make sure that you learn the material backwards and forwards and become a much better writer in the process. This is definitely the best class I have taken at Dartmouth.\"",

Furthermore, we had a 10-15 page research paper AND a 4 page final paper due during finals week. Yep, pretty sucky. However, despite this, the class was really amazing. Discussion among the students was so so, but the class really came to life when lago started talking about such and such during this and this. Some people thought that he was arrogant, but I thought that he was fascinating. The man knows his stuff. You can't BS your way through this class because he seriously knows EVERYTHING. He really cares about this class too (unlike some of the seminar profs, or so I've heard) and our papers were always returned by the next class with pages - yes, PAGES - of comments.

            "review 12: \"05W with P. David: The Armada was complex, which you'll quickly discover in this class. In hindsight, all the reading and discussing and writing were worthwhile. Professor Lagomarsino really emphasizes his desire for you to become a true historian by urging you to analyze readings, write papers, and create bibliographies like one. I really felt he met us halfway, based on his preparations for our class and the amount of comments he offered on our returned papers. Professor Lagomarsino is also extremely accessible during office hours, but be prepared to wait in line. Overall, I was really pleased with the work I did for this class, and I feel I gained much from this experience.\"",

He's incredibly interested and excited in what his students have to say. He is available and welcoming outside of class. While this course had more reading than the average course, it was worth it.

You turn in rough drafts for each one, and Erison is very thorough with the comments he gives back.

While some of my friends were complaining about reading 100 pages a day, each reading assignment was 30 to 40 pages, and I'm erring on the larger side here. She reads every draft submitted, and comments crazily on each paper (to the point you fear you're going to get a bad grade, only to find out she has a \"well done\" waiting for you on the last page). The assignments for research workshops really enlighten you about the library's workings, and how to write better. It's hard to think of how she could improve better in this regard. Where things fall short somewhat is the topic of the course - everyone, including Darrow herself, said we were sick and tired of Marie Antoinette at the course's end. Reading about Marie Antoinette's life gets repetitive quite quickly (about halfway through the term, at the latest), and having to write about it can make you rather sick (although it is some sort of perverse reward to find a source which doesn't fit the usual mold). As a course, I would say avoid this unless (like me) you don't mind being sick and tired of Marie Antoinette at the end of the term. As a freshman seminar, I would say you have to take this course - it is invaluable in terms of preparing you for college research and writing.\"",

Take quotes out as you read, maybe on the computer, because they will be your sources when you write papers. Professor Darrow was really sensitive to the problems we were having in writing papers, and she tailored her exercises accordingly. We learned how to use the library resources, as well as how to use primary and secondary sources.

Her directions are lengthy and convoluted. She claims to be available outside of class, but she was more than 25 minutes late for all three meetings I had with her. She is also incredibly inconsistent with her grading system, and often contradicts her own directions from one draft to the next of a paper. Her syllabus also does not give an accurate description of the class itself. She says that there will be three short papers and one long research paper, but I have actually written 10 papers this term. She doesn't explain what she wants in a paper, and then hands them back saying the whole class failed in the assignment.

We confronted her as a class and she admitted to setting us up for failure. This is ridiculous! The most pathetic thing of all is that the term is over and I still don't know what she wanted from us.

It's always a real thought-provoking affair.\"",

We borrowed camera equipment from the Jones Media Center in order to do the video taping, and shared our excerpts from our projects in a final presentation on the last class. We also had to write a paper analyzing the interviews. Prof. Spitzer wasn't very specific about what he wanted in our writing assignments. At first this worried me, because I was afraid my papers wouldn't be \"right.\" It turns out he wants you to be creative and it's OK to write about whatever you want, so long as the paper has a unifying arguement.

Her comments were not helpful in improving the way you write: she only points out what details/themes you missed out. She does not give any advice on \"how\" you synthesize. The point of such seminar is to improve your writing; naturally, the prof should have focused more on \"how.\" Basically, you throw all details she looks for, and you get a decent grade. 2) Discussion: discussion was rather a regurgitation of stuff you read; as a result, discussions were not as engaging as students wanted them to be. 3) Professor: As pointed out in other reviews, she does seem to have problem in logically defending her points of view. For instance, when I went to see her in an office hour to question one of the comments on the research paper, she basically said \"it should be so\" ('Just acknowledge it') while I inquired \"why\" ('Avoid absolutist arguments'). It was said (I didn't feel so) that some people were a bit annoyed by her condescending tone, while I find her to be a bit judgmental at times. She is not a tough grader, however.

If she likes you, this class will be your best of your term; if she doesn't like you, be prepared for harsh critcism.

If you can refrain from doing the above, you're in for a good ride. The 10A timeslot is tough to fill, but she did a rather effective job. Professor Crossley is exactly the type of professor the school needs, although she could do without a little bit of the meanness, which springs up at times. She is challenging, rhetorically agile, and pushes students to synthesize their own theories, as well as to publicly state and defend their opinions. I think the most fun part of the entire class for me was when at the end, when she asked, \"So, what did you think of this course?\" I raised my hand and basically said, \"I don't buy it. There's just not enough evidence, not enough there to convince me of the course's premise,\" that there is no such thing as a cultural explanation for history or historical events, among other things. Instead of getting defensive, she lauded my honesty and said that since I had good reasons for my opinions, my views were extremely valid. It takes a prof with high self-esteem to admit outright the possibility that what she has been teaching is complete bunk. Now, I mentioned her occasional meanness: it is a factor in class, I'll put it that way. For students who make their way onto her not-fond list, life can be rough. She can be insulting, inflammatory, and just plain-out mean (she once called a student \"brain damaged\" after the student suggested an implausible theory of historical causation). Be prepared: I'm a softie at heart, and her conduct at times struck me as unprofessional and heartless. Despite the occasional outbursts of unnecessary vitriol, Crossley makes this course. She is, as a professor, in line with such Dartmouth stars as Classics prof Christenson and Government's Lucas Swaine, in that she demands good work from students, challenges them to think, and truly instills knowledge. Crossley's courses aren't for the faint of heart, but you'll come out feeling like you learned quite a bit. I'll be looking for courses by Crossley in the future, despite the fact that I'm not interested in majoring in history at all. I suggest you do too if you have at least moderately thick skin.\""

I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt because she's a new prof, but it felt like she didn't really care about her students and just wanted to prove to be a powerful professor (even though she seemed like a fairly nice person). The questions she asked in class also provoked little to no discussion and the one essay she assigned was vague, forcing her to have to spend a chunk of in-class time to clear up all the questions we had for her.

This was a pretty typical History class, even though it is technically an intro there will be the same grading standards applied as upper level ones. I thought Meehan was an entertaining lecturer. I wasn't a huge fan of his assessment style, he had a final paper (short film analysis) and a final project (podcast or paper) due around the same time which was tough, but doable. He didn't have a final though, which made me check out of paying attention to lectures after the midterm.

This is a SURVEY COURSE and he shouldn't be expecting upper level material from the students... Save the final exam (which wasn't bad at all), there wasn't ANY gauging of one's understanding of the course material in a general context, as a survey course would entail. The majority of our grades were based on two papers written outside of class based on two individual sources we had read. But this was pointless. If you didn't write your paper EXACTLY the way Lagomarsino wanted you to, your grade would get slammed. Some of my friends went in to his office hours to talk to him about their papers and it didn't help them any!! First, I thought it was just me who had issues with this class...but after talking to lots of friends we all realized what he was up to was grading on a steep curve by giving out a couple A's, a couple B-'s, and basically squeezing everyone else in around a B+. Lagomarsino asks for Y and wants X. He is undoubtedly one of the best lecturers on campus, but it's beyond me why everyone goes on & on about how great he is. If you take ANY class with Lago, NRO it. That way you can deal with him and not get burned. As for Koop, he didn't seem to know what he was doing. He got roped in to teach portions of this class when Simons had to bow out this term and he was clearly lost -- he seems like a nice guy but this was NOT his specialty by any means, there's no way we could have expected anything of him - the kids who had him as discussion leader got away with an easy/lost teacher, while the rest of us with Lagomarsino suffered! There's still no excuse of why a survey class places ridiculous emphasis (50% of the grade) on two small papers that hardly show mastery of the mastery of the material at hand. Avoid this class like the Black Death (which is the topic of Lago's best lecture, by the way)!!\"",

            "review 60: \"03F with P. David: I\u2019m not too sure why the Course Reviewers are only letting me review one of the two professors who did the course (but Simons would get the same grades as I gave Lagomarsino), but this was a very enjoyable walk through European history from 476 to 1715. Simons teaches the first part of the course, which covers events between the fall of Rome to about 1350. Lagomarsino does the rest. The fact that Simons has a low voice and seems to turn bright red without apparent reason does not detract from his lectures, so as long as you show up for them. I had morning drill, so having a 100 percent attendance record was easy, but not everyone was as fortunate as I was. Simons, as everyone seems to know, is a prominent medievalist, and an engaging lecturer. The course begins with a film detailing a general survey of the Middle Ages, but this was a sleeper\u2019s paradise. His occasional jokes (e.g., while he showed us a sketch of Old St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, he sped his pointer along its sides and said, \u201cHere, you get souvenirs\u201d) were thoughtfully done. At times, his placid tone could put an already tired person to sleep (I did see a few people totally out during his lectures), but he is very knowledgeable and perhaps even the more lenient grader of the two professors. It is a shame that I never saw how he performed during discussions, but I\u2019ve heard that he handles them extremely well. He is an extremely gentle person who might need a little mouthwash, but I say this constructively and I think that we should all learn to not only tolerate but cherish professors with their diversity of hygiene habits. We\u2019re supposedly about that D-word anyway. The way in which he hosted the only other class film, a rendition of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, was extremely well done, as was his introduction of a filmed excerpt of Prince Charles\u2019 accession to the crown prince status (to illustrate the continuous traditions of feudalism through time). If you want to leave during this the only class film, go by all means but be sure to tell Simons beforehand with some halfway reasonable excuse. Lagomarsino is undoubtedly the more verbal and physical of the two lecturers; His muted gesticulations and the way he incessantly clutches the dais and pitches his plump body forward during lectures certainly complemented that. I think he drinks tepid water (unlike Simons\u2019 preference for steaming water, or at least what I think is steaming water). He also peppers his lectures with anecdotes, which do not necessitate notes, but are good breathers to recoup points one might have missed in the past few minutes. Lagomarsino usually starts his lectures forty seconds or so later than Simons does, although for all his insistence on punctuality, this could be confusing. For a person who seems to prefer concision in papers, he likes to grandiloquently state the date and time for a final as if it were some parliamentary edict (\u201cThe final examination will be here, 13 Carpenter, Sunday, the seventh of December\u201d). His discussions were pretty standard, but you need to show up to them only because he raises important questions whose answers may not be covered in the session but require critical thinking on your part (and also because he checks attendance). Actually, he once rushed in a thought about how similar Luther\u2019s treatise was to a previous reading of Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince. In the back of my mind, I knew that this comparison might be the subject of one of the questions on the final examination. Yet I fooled myself and walked into that final examination having totally abandoned Machiavelli in my studies. One of the questions was based upon exactly what I had dismissed, but I managed pretty well anyway. If you do well on the midterm (which, despite its 22 minute-per-essay format is pretty easy) he will actually know you and begin to greet you. Not doing well [here] is not the end of the world since there is a paper and the final examination, but at that point you\u2019ll have to start digging your heels. Regarding the standard stuff, the textbook is enjoyable, the sort of thing you can expect to peruse over under a beach umbrella holding lemonade. I made the mistake of making detailed notes on the book in the beginning, but it turns out that you only need to take notes on points of relevance given in the weekly study guides (which are totally indispensable). The readings themselves encompass the bulk of what you need to know, to say nothing of the lectures. They ranged from the short Life of Charlemagne by Einhard and the longest piece, an account of a heretical village in France (which turned out to be the most soporific work, and I think I struggled through this one). You would be happy taking detailed notes on these books. If the stuff doesn\u2019t soak through your mind like a sponge (as it did for me on Einhard) you will have to condemn yourself to memorizing your notes lest you lack specifics to back up assertions on examinations (as I was compelled to do on all of the other works). Overall, the emphasis on generalizations, essay tests without any multiple-choice questions, and the need to have a sympathetic and thoughtful perspective on readings (along with the concomitant need to elaborate these viewpoints on examinations) does not make this course merely easy. However, it is absolutely compulsory to take notes nearly verbatim during lectures, so that the way you synthesize them in your free time is more effective. It is also fascinating and even seductive to the point where some of my premed friends are now thinking of jumping on the history major bandwagon. Even if history is not your cup of tea, you\u2019ve got to be receptive to this material to get that \u201cspecial\u201d A minus grade or better. In short, it\u2019s quite worth your while.\"",
            "review 61: \"02W with P. David: Walter Simons and David Lagomarsino are hands-down spectacular profs. Their lectures are exciting and vivid. They really help you to understand the material. Simons really knows how to evoke the mood of the Middle Ages period in his lectures, and the same goes for Lagomarsino with respect to the pre-modern period (Simons covers the lectures for the first part of the course--the Middle Ages--while Lagomarsino observes, and then they switch at around the point of the mid-term, and Lagomarsino covers the pre-modern era). The course has a midterm, a final, and a 2500-word essay on a discussion section reading of your choice. The midterm composes of a map-quiz, in which you are given a map of Europe and asked to mark the sites of 10 historical events, and 2 out of 4 bluebook essay questions. The final follows the same format, but it is 2 hours instead of 1, and it has an additional essay question that is required. They pass this essay question out in discussion section a few weeks prior to the final exam. For '02 Winter, the question was this: \"The terms 'crisis' and 'revolutionary change' have been used often and widely in History 3. Which crises and revolutions were most important in the development of Europe from the Fall of Rome to 1715? Explain your definition of these two terms, and justify your choices in a well-written and cogent argument.\" History 3 is a survey course, and that does mean that it tends to move a bit fast, and it covers a large period of history in a short period, and thus misses on a lot of the detail. This is made up for by interesting discussion section readings, but it can be a bit frustrating at times. Nevertheless, the course is worth taking if only because of professors Simons and Lagomarsino. These two profs are spectacular, and the prof makes the course.\"",

Mostly we could rely on the in class notes facilitated by the outline put up on the board each day. It was like being in highschool again. Discussion sections were helpful.

Clearly, a lot was left out, but that which was included was, for the most part, presented and discussed extremely well. Medieval and Early Modern Europe really is quite fascinating, if mind-bogglingly dense at times. The textbook reading, as one would expect, can become a bit overwhelming at times; it needs to be framed by one's lecture notes and a good deal of common sense. Simons lectures on Medieval Europe, which constitutes the first half of the course; Lagomarsino does everything from the Renaissance onwards. Both are excellent lecturers: witty, thorough, and organized. They also keep generous office hours. Apart from lectures, there were also weekly discussion sections, which drew upon readings of mostly primary documents in translation. We read, amongst other things, Machiavelli's Prince and the Magna Carta. These two were rather short; others were extremely long. Along with the textbook reading, this made for quite a bit of work per week. Testing: two exams and a 10-page paper on assigned topics. Quite fair, I think. The subject matter really makes this course indispensable. The lack of depth is more than compensated for by the broad, macro-historic approach that we were encouraged to take.\"",

            "review 1: \"11F with Joseph Cullon: This class I think is a good mix of a survey course (covers a lot of time) but still goes pretty in-depth for most things. Just FYI Cullon LOVES colonial era history (his specialty), and thus spends a disproportionate amount of time on the topic. Also, we didn't end up covering all the way through the Civil War like the syllabus said, so if you're taking this class for the Civil War stuff, you'll be disappointed. This class had 2 mid-terms and a final, plus 2 analytical papers. His tests are pretty straight-forward and painless. You also spend a class or half a class reviewing for the test and helping him to come up with the questions, which is nice. The mid-terms were about 15 multiple choice (which are surprisingly tricky), 3 short answer (paragraph length) from 4 choices, and 1 essay from 2 choices. If you took AP US History in high school, the exams feel like the AP exam. For the papers you have opportunities to re-write them, though that's a lot of work. He's also a pretty easy grader for the papers. You get to pick which papers you do (there are 4 scattered throughout the term, you pick 2). I'd recommend you pick the earlier ones because the end of the class gets very busy. His feedback on the papers was helpful and very clear. Lots of reading (both textbook and primary sources), lots of which is pretty boring and it moves fast, but it could be worse. Cullon's lectures are long and not super great. I know I had trouble focusing and not falling asleep in this 10A, but a lot of that is just because he speaks slowly and in run-on sentences, not because of the material. But apparently lots of people loved his lectures, so maybe that's just me. And for a lecture class, he incorporates a fair bit of discussion. He's also good about including differing historical views on the events you talk about. If you go and talk to him, Cullon's a really friendly guy, who's really happy to just talk to you about nerdy history questions you may have. He's also happy to help you plan your papers and discuss the prompts with you. A really good guy who's more lively one-on-one than in lecture. Overall, I'd say this course, though a bit boring and reading-heavy, was good. A good survey of the first half of US History, and you definitely learn a good deal.\"",

My one criticism for the course is all the focus on revisionist and multiculturalist elements at the expense of expanding upon the traditional aspects of the material. All of the race/class/gender stuff can get a little preachy. One book in particular we had to read, Roots of Bitterness, about female American history, obviously came with a bit of a bias. Good course overall though.\"",
            "review 18: \"03F with Joseph Cullon: It's hard to review 120 years of history in ten weeks, but the class was a pretty fair sample of the period. It focuses more on themes than specifics. For example, expect to learn about Republicanism but don't expect to talk about the battles of the Civil War. Professor Cullon is a very nice guy who knows his stuff. He sometimes gets a little flustered and confused during lectures, but overall he does a good job of explaining the material.\"",
            "review 19: \"03F with Joseph Cullon: Prof. Cullon was a great prof considering the fact that it was his first term ever at Dartmouth. He was very responsive and understanding to students and their needs. I liked the class a lot.\"",
            "review 20: \"03F with Joseph Cullon: This class was awesome. It really inspired me and helped me understand different point of views in early American History. If you can, TAKE this class! The prof is fantastic and VERY helpful. He is always willing to help out students and make sure that they understand. GREAT class!!!!\""

He is a very soft speaker, and the class size is pretty small. He doesn't give out As, so if you want a B+ take this class.\"",

            "review 3: \"05F with Craig S.: I came into the class wanted a review/overview in early American history. Instead I got nothing, but little bits of random times. In terms of learning things Wilder is a funny, approachable guy, but his lectures do not educate you on overall patterns in history. Exams cover only readings, which you never go over in class. Although he is a nice man going to class is worthless. You can get away with doing average work and get a B, but a higher grade is difficult to achieve\"",

            "review 5: \"02F with Craig S.: Wilder isn't a bad prof, but his lectures can be redundant at times. The class has a strong emphasis on race and gender in American history. If you do the work, you'll do well in the class.\"",
            "review 6: \"02F with Craig S.: I can't stress enough how wonderful Prof. Wilder is. He knew his stuff back to front, he gave great lectures, and his reading assignments for the most part were interesting. This was not your usual US History. We did not memorize facts (isn't that what we all did in high school anyway?) - we analyzed \"why\" things happened when and to whom. It was a great class - I am going to take more of Prof. Wilder's classes in the future, and I would recommend this history to almost anyone.\"",
            "review 7: \"02F with Craig S.: I would take any class taught by Professor Wilder. If you do the reading, the class should not be too difficult. The lectures are not much help for the exams, (which are based solely on the reading), but are helpful in selecting a paper topic.\"",
            "review 8: \"02F with Craig S.: Basically, this was a course about slavery, with a few readings about women and labor thrown in. Most of the readings were interesting, but more so in the second half of the course. It was sometimes frustrating that there is no textbook to refer to--I had never taken a history course covering this period, and I felt lost sometimes not reading/hearing about political history. Most of the lectures were long and repetitive, but some were interesting, delving into some of the events touched upon in our readings. Professor Wilder was incredibly responsive and positive whenever students talked in class, finding a way to twist any answer into a correct answer even if it was blatantly wrong. The midterm seemed easy but was graded harshly, and the 12-15 page paper was graded harshly as well... Final seemed REALLY easy. Take this course if you want to learn a lot about slavery, but not if you're just interested in a survey of this time period.\"",
            "review 9: \"02F with Craig S.: Prof. Wilder just came from 7 years at Williams, and was nervous at first, it seemed, but warmed up quickly. He's a funny guy. I had just taken US History senior year of high school and took this Freshman Fall, so I didn't have to do as much work because I was familiar with the time period, but I liked the structure of focusing more on themes rather than straight chronology (though that kind of defines college history classes). I should've done more work and got away with doing less because of past learning, but most of the books were pertinent and i wish i had read more. Anyways, good Prof and a solid class.\"",
            "review 10: \"02F with Craig S.: The class was far from what i expected it to be. I thought it was going to be an overview of the time period, but it turned out to be more of a study of the people of the time period. We talked about why things happened and who made them happen instead of just memorizing dates and names. Prof. Wilder was a little nervous in his first term and I even thought about dropping the course at the beginning. I'm happy I stuck with it, because Prof. Wilder gave interesting lectures and he really proved that he knew his stuff. Overall, it was a good course that was made even better by Prof. Wilder.\""

            "review 1: \"09S with Robert Bonner: This was more of a Comp Lit class than history, we spent probably 50 percent of the class on the work of Lydia Maria Child. We didn't learn about the War of 1812 which, from what I can gather, was pretty important. I thought I was doing well, got pretty good grades on everything I got back, and then out of nowhere got a terrible final grade so the course is definitely lacking in transparency. If you're looking for a course to learn how to be a historian and not to actually learn history, this is right up your alley\"",

Classes are composed of his ramblings and lectures that seem endless...countless times the class was forced to stay past class time as he tried to finish his lecture. Bonner is also never available outside classroom hours. he rarely has office hours and there at the mist odd times...8am in the morning! plus, he replies to blitzes two weeks later! Everyone sits in class dazed and he tries to stir discussions which is futile...avoid his class...he's nice but after your second week that no longer counts....\""

            "review 1: \"01F with Vernon Takeshita: This simply put was the worst class ever taught by a professor who wasn't too much better. It all started when I ventured to Wheelock Books to by the texts - he mixed up his schedule and thought he was teaching History 2. So the books came a week late, but it didn't matter because you didn't need to read them at all to do well on his exams. The frustration continued until the last day when he didn't have the keys to the room in which we were to take the final exam. All of us stood out in the hall for 30 minutes and ended up moving to an empty classroom upset to take a 4pm exam. Instead of telling you about the thousands of reasons why you shouldn't take this class, I'll give you reasons why one would... 1. You did not get a 5 on the U.S. History Exam in High School. This is punishment for not coming into Dartmouth with the credit. 2. You love race relations. Forget that during the time period this class covers America fought three major wars (including one Revolution and a Civil War), established herself as a nation and endured much political and social change. The entire class focuses on racial and gender inequality. 3. Do you hate George Washington? How about Andrew Jackson? Do important Americans not matter much to you? Then you'll love skipping over them in favor of military history - each and every battle fought on American soil is just oh so important. 4. You don't mind annoying freshmen interrupting the professor every other breath of his lectures to ask important questions such as \"When was Thomas Jefferson born\" or my personal favorite \"Is it okay to use wide-ruled paper even though we're in college?\" 5. You can afford to give up your free time for discussion sections in which your toddler sister could participate. 6. Knowing how you're doing in a class scares you. If you hate feedback then this is the perfect class. Kiss your midterms and term paper goodbye once you turn them in - they'll never see you again. 7. Useless knowledge fascinates you. Stamp Act? The War of 1812? No, let's learn a little more about the house in which Alexander Hamilton was born. 8. You LOVE wasting your time reading boring books. 9. You've learned enough American history - because you won't learn any more in this class. Some people would say that this review has been harsh, but I think many who took this course with this professor would disagree.\"",
            "review 2: \"01F with Vernon Takeshita: History 1 is an introductory survey course. That carries many connotations, both good and bad. On the one hand, this course gives you a very good overview of the time period in American history and gives you a feel for how americans and America changed over time--particularly helpful with this last point is Gordon Wood's \"Radicalism of the American Revolution.\" On the other hand, it can be frustrating that you get the essential facts about many interesting events in U.S. history, but never delve as deeply into them as one probably would in an upper-level course. One thing that serves to alleviate this last fact--and to increase the workload in the course--is that there is a 15-page research paper on the syllabus. Doing this paper will definitely provide you with the opportunity to focus a great deal on one particular event and learn a great deal about it. Professor Takeshita lets you pick pretty much any event, covered in the course, that interests you, so this is good as well. Professor Takeshita gives effective, illuminating, and informative lectures. This is a man who clearly knows his stuff. He also has a very friendly demeanor, which makes him very approachable. He is extremely helpfull in guiding you through the research paper, if you approach him for his help. A fellow student in the class--a rabid Dartmouth Reviewer--was talking to me, and he praised Takeshita for presenting an unbiased view of the political issues involved, \"even though he's a fairly liberal prof.\" I would concur. Takeshita clearly has his own opinions, but he makes every effort to present both sides of the equation, if only to better understand the side of the equation that he comes down on. Freshmen would definitely benifet from Takeshita's guidance on the research paper, for it will definitely begin to prepare them well for future research papers.\""
