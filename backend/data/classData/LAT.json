There were translations due every class for some portions of the term, but they were never too difficult or long and she was always extremely lenient in grading them. Most classes were spent going over / correcting our translations in small groups and then reviewing as a class so you could pretty much always fix any mistakes before handing in your work. There were two take-home midterms (both of which were very short projects that took 30 min - 1 hour to complete) and a take-home final which wasn't much work at all. This class has many fun trips to the book arts workshop and you get to look at some cool books in the Rauner. She also brings her dog into class sometimes. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and would recommend it to anyone who gets the chance to take it.\"",

It assumes you have a working knowledge of Latin and while you will go over tricky grammar, this isn't the majority of the class. midterms were projects that were hard not to get an A on. homework was assigned daily but took a max of 1.5 hours, normally more like 1 hour max. homework was graded but I never got below an 85 (and only below a 90% once) on an HW assignment - I also had an average to not great Latin background coming into this class. I did hear my classics major classmates wishing it were harder, so bear that in mind. This class focuses a lot on the various forms of literature so you get to spend some time in Rauner and the Book Arts workshop which was just awesome. Professor Lynn is amazing and brings her dog, Emma the \"wonderdog\" in to class sometimes. Would 100% recommend this class.\""

The first 2 related to Cicero's letters to his friends, the 3rd was Catullus' poetry, and the last 2 were Cicero's philosophical writings about friendship (the De Amicitia). At the end of each unit there was a short quiz which had a couple of translation sections and then short answer questions or IDs from the lecture part of the class/readings. The grade was also based on 3 essays- 2 3-4 page papers and a 10 page research paper at the end (only 1 of which actually involved close analysis of latin- the other 2 were more philosophical). There was also a 20 minute oral report midway through the class that invovled researching a certain friend of Cicero. The grading was not difficult and Professor Graver always told us what she was looking for. I guess why I was surprised by the course was the amount of time we spent talking about Epicureanism/Stoicism etc. instead of reading latin. There was almost no grammar discussed but she expects you to know it so make sure you have a good background in the basics before taking the course. Also, even though in theory the class only met 2 times a week, it was more like 4 times because on wednesdays either the x-hour was used or we had to have conferences with her (which were good to get to know her but not always helpful, although she is more than willing to read papers before the due date) and the quizzes were taken on our own time on fridays usually.

You also do individual work; a close reading of one section, such as atomic physics, free will, mortality, fear of the gods, evolution, anthropology, anatomy (it's all in there), and then a final paper that you can relate to the first paper (I did, it makes life easy).

        "Edward Bradley": [
            "review 1: \"03W with Edward Bradley: The language requirement at Dartmouth stinks, and it's a major major fraud. I guarantee you that if you gave an editorial in Le Monde to a French major or an editorial in Der Speigel to a German major, etc. and told that person to read it in a half-hour and write a response to it in the foreign language in question in about an hour, he/she would not be able to do it. By all rights, that is not fluency. The only proper way to learn a language is by going and living for at least an entire year in a country where that language is spoken. Learning it back in the US to any degree of respectable fluency requires a dedication to that language (and a forswearing of much interaction in English) that most Dartmouth students can't afford the time for. So if during freshman week you didn't place out of the language requirement or place into Language 2 or 3 in whatever you studied in highschool, Latin is a great way to fulfill the language requirement. The main reasons being: --There is no Latin 2. After you pass Latin 1 you take Latin 3, and after you pass Latin 3 you've fulfilled the language requirement. This means 2 terms of torture (and only 2 wasted course credits which could have been used for more interesting courses) instead of 3. --They do not expect you to be able to speak Latin, for the obvious reason that it's a dead language. This means NO DRILL!!! It also makes the class easier. You are mostly expected to just translate (and 90% of the time it's Latin into English, rather than the other way around). --Wheelock's Latin. This is the textbook that is most often used at Dartmouth. If you can, try to get into a section with a professor who uses Wheelock's Latin. It is a very good textbook. It uses the old-fashioned grammatical approach to teaching a language rather than some of the dipshit methods that a lot of recent language textbooks tend to use while ignoring grammar. --Learning Latin will improve your understanding of English, since a lot of words in English are derived from Latin words. This is one thing that may actually prove useful in terms of overall education, rather than pretending to be fluent after 2 terms and an LSPlay spent shopping and eating at McDonalds in Paris or Berlin or wherever. Latin is not a gut. Latin is one of the most grammatically complicated languages in the Western Hemisphere. It's a lot of work, and it will become extremely difficult if you slip behind even a little bit in the work, especially if you do not keep up with memorizing vocabulary words or become lax with your homework. Latin is also a little faster-paced since it's a two-term sequence rather than a three-term sequence (personally, I think this compression helps to retain what you've learned). If you are a freshmen, you might want to consider putting off taking Latin until your sophomore year and enjoy your freshman year (and you may or may not be better prepared to handle the class after a year of adjusting to Dartmouth)--that's what I did. Having said all of this, Latin is by far the most painless way to fulfill the language requirement if you haven't already placed out of it, or placed into Language 2 or 3 of whatever you took in highschool. Professor Bradley was absolutely amazing. He is one of my favorite professors at Dartmouth, and I say this after having taken only one course with him, in a subject that I loath. Bradley is so incredibly charismatic that he actually made me enjoy the class. Because of him, I was even tempted to go on to take Latin 10, despite not needing it for the language-requirement and the fact that I hate language classes with a passion (in case you hadn't already figured that out). After passing Latin 3, I shedded that particular delusion, but the fact that Bradley even got me tempted to take Latin 10 speaks volumes. Bradley is a fair grader and is an extraordinarily good teacher. I am not sure if it's his teaching method, his personality, or a combination of both, but Bradley is very effective at teaching Latin. He spends most classes going over the homework, and has each student read something aloud in class from his or her homework, and he is very gentle when handling a student who has gotten something hideously wrong. It is this quality in him which makes his students more willing to speak up and try to learn something. Bradley also has a tendency to go off on long tangents about ancient Roman history, which though generally off-topic with respect to actually learning Latin they were usually grounded in some portion of the homework, and it actually made the otherwise-bland homework interesting since Bradley provided background info (don't worry; you're not tested on this info; just your ability to translate Latin). Bradley even assigned one or two really randy poems by Catullus, which were entertaining. What more could you ask for? A class where you study a little bit of ancient pornography! Bradley was somewhat irregular in how often he gave quizzes and collected homework, but his tests and quizzes were quite fair. Latin 3 differs from Latin 1 in that in Latin 1 you're studying most of the really important parts of Latin grammar. In Latin 3, you finish up the last bits of important grammar such as the subjunctive case, and then you get into the more obscure things that you rarely encounter, such as the supine. You are also expected to read an actual non-textbook work of Latin. Bradley had us read a short play by a 12th-century christian nun, and we read this play over the course of several weeks (at the rate of one or two pages per week), so if you did your homework with the play you would be fine. For the same rant about the language requirement and my review of Latin 1, look up Latin 1 in '02F with Prof. Hawthorne.\""

            "review 1: \"02F with Kevin G.: Hawthorne is a really nice guy, and I think this is his first term teaching at Dartmouth. My favorite classes were spent learning about and reciting Latin poetry and Greek and Roman philosophers. But days like that were rare. Our sole text was \"Wheelock's Latin,\" which is a great book and one of the best textbooks, so they say. All we did in class, however, was go through last night's reading--Hawthorne often taught with the book tucked in his arm. I understand that it was necessary to go over homework (every other day we had to turn in exercises that were corrected but not graded), but I wish that Hawthorne could have taught the material in a new way, or put a spin on it--basically, he could have done a lot more to make Latin 1 interesting and to make it worthwhile to attend class. We had a quiz almost every week, a midterm and a final, two oral exams (reading passages aloud to him to make Latin feel like a language and not just a \"puzzle\") and those corrected-not-graded exercises. If you can find another teacher who uses \"Wheelock's Latin,\" I'd go for him or her. (I was in Rutter's class the first day. He seemed like a very dynamic prof, but the books he used emphasized fluent reading and comprehension of Latin more than grammar lessons. \"Wheelock's Latin\" focuses more on the grammar.)\"",
            "review 2: \"02F with Kevin G.: The language requirement at Dartmouth sucks, and it's a major major fraud. I guarantee you that if you gave an editorial in Le Monde to a French major or an editorial in Der Speigel to a German major, etc. and told that person to read it in a half-hour and write a response to it in the foriegn language in question in about an hour, he/she would not be able to do it. By all rights, that is not fluency. The only proper way to learn a language is by going and living for at least an entire year in a country where that language is spoken. Learning it back in the US to any degree of respectable fluency requires a dedication to that language (and a forswearing of much interaction in English) that most Dartmouth students can't afford the time for. So if during freshman week you didn't place out of the language requirement or place into Language 2 or 3 in whatever you studied in highschool, Latin is a great way to fulfill the language requirement. The main reasons being: --There is no Latin 2. After you pass Latin 1 you take Latin 3, and after you pass Latin 3 you've fulfilled the language requirement. This means 2 terms of torture (and only 2 wasted course credits which could have been used for more interesting courses) instead of 3. --They do not expect you to be able to speak Latin, for the obvious reason that it's a dead language. This means NO DRILL!!! It also makes the class easier. You are mostly expected to just translate (and 90% of the time it's Latin into English, rather than the other way around). --Wheelock's Latin. This is the textbook that is most often used at Dartmouth. If you can, try to get into a section with a professor who uses Wheelock's Latin. It is a very good textbook. It uses the old-fashioned grammatical approach to teaching a language rather than some of the dipshit methods that a lot of recent language textbooks tend to use, while ignoring grammar. --Learning Latin will improve your understanding of English, since a lot of words in English are derived from Latin words. This is one thing that may actually prove useful in terms of overall education, rather than pretending to be fluent after 2 terms and an LSPlay spent shopping and eating at McDonalds in Paris or Berlin or wherever. Latin is not a gut. Latin is one of the most grammatically complicated languages in the Western Hemisphere. It's a lot of work, and it will become extremely difficult if you slip behind even a little bit in the work, especially if you do not keep up with memorizing vocabulary words or become lax with your homework. Latin is also a little faster-paced since it's a two-term sequence rather than a three-term sequence (personally, I think this compression helps to retain what you've learned). If you are a freshmen, you might want to consider putting off taking Latin until your sophomore year and enjoy your freshman year (and you may or may not be better prepared to handle the class after a year of adjusting to Dartmouth)--that's what I did. Having said all of this, Latin is by far the most painless way to fullfill the language requirement if you haven't already placed out of it, or placed into Language 2 or 3 of whatever you took in highschool. Professor Hawthorne was inoffensive. He was neither particularly good nor particularly bad. This is no surprise, because it is very hard (and rare) for a professor to really shine when teaching such a mindlessly mechanical class as an introductory language class. Asking for brilliant teaching in a class like this is like asking for brilliant teaching in 3rd-grade arithmetic. Hawthorne was a competent teacher and a fair grader (he gave me a bad grade in the class, but then again I deserved it!). I have no complaints about him. An upper level class would no doubt prove a better test of how good or bad a professor he is. Testing and papers vary in every course, depending on the professor. Obviously, there were no papers in this class. Hawthorne gave a quiz every Friday on the material covered that week, and gave a midterm and a cumulative final. The quizzes and exams were easy if you had done the work, and if you hadn't, quite difficult! Coming attractions: Look up Latin 3 with Prof. Bradley in '03W for the same rant about the language requirement, much praise of Prof. Bradley, and what Latin 3 is like.\""
