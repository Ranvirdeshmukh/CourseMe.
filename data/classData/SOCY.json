            "review 2: \"23X with Brooke Harrington: This is the worst class I have taken here at Dartmouth as a direct result of the lack of effort by the professor. I have truly never met such a lazy teacher in my life (and I went to an underfunded public school). Professor Harrington will tell you to get your friends to pretend to sign up for the class so that it doesn't get cancelled from low enrollment (which I'm pretty sure is against some sort of Registrar policy) -- don't do it, it's a trap! She had us teach the readings to each other, which could potentially be rewarding if this was paired with engagement and feedback from the professor. Instead, the professor texted on her phone during class and did not give any feedback to us on our presentation styles or understanding of the material -- I have no way of knowing that she was even listening to us when we were speaking. She put just as little effort into the course outside of class meeting times. There were no office hours, so we could only ask her to stay after class or try to track her down after her other class. I got zero feedback on the 15+ presentations that I gave throughout the course, and I only got a grade back on one assignment. She didn't even bother to give written instructions for our final presentation (30% of the grade), and refused to answer my questions on her expectations, so I had to guess what she wanted and pray for the best. While I ended up doing well in the class, I had no idea how well I was doing throughout the term. I am a hardworking student by all means but I wasn't even able to push myself to improve or grow because of the lack of feedback and engagement from the professor, which was the most demoralizing aspect of this class. I did not gain any practical skills or tools in this class. If you want to learn about the sociology of professions, read her book on your own time; you will learn the same amount of information as I did. It's safe to say that I will NEVER take another class with this professor again!\"",
            "review 3: \"23X with Brooke Harrington: This class was the worst class I have ever taken. First, it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re getting yourself into when taking this class (because I didn\u2019t!): only three people were taking the class and the professor made students present on every class reading, and she did not adjust the number of presentations or readings even though the class was designed for more than three students. Therefore, we were doing double or triple the amount of presentations and readings. Harrington claimed that the class would cater to students\u2019 interests because of the small class size, but not a single reading was changed or added to accommodate our interests. Also know that Harrington does not actually teach or lecture (the one time she had to present on a reading, she reused a previous student\u2019s presentation). Harrington\u2019s syllabus and policies are unaccommodating: she claims to mark you down a letter grade for any class you are more than 10 minutes late, despite the fact that she showed up late to class multiple times, and she has a no electronics policy (we convinced her not to enforce this), even though she was on her phone for prolonged periods during class. Maybe this class would have been worth it if I learned a lot, but after week 2, the readings were redundant and the entire class was based on the five readings that you were expected to read before the first class. All these issues are compounded by Harrington\u2019s lack of standards and clarity when it comes to grades. Harrington does not have any written instructions or rubrics, there are only two assignments, an oral midterm (10 minutes to show your understanding of the class material) and a final presentation where you choose a case study and apply the course concepts. Harrington does not have any practice questions for the midterm and only spoke of the midterm in the class before the exam. When you ask for a rubric to understand your grade, it is clear she does not have a rubric to ensure consistency in grading. This lack of clarity was even worse for the final presentation: no instructions, a changing definition of what a case study is, and no feedback or explanation for your grade. Want to ask her questions about the class or for feedback? Well, there are no established office hours and you have to beg her to stay after class to get your questions answered. This is coming from someone who did very well in the class, but it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re getting yourself into when taking this class. My advice: avoid this class at all costs!\"",
            "review 4: \"21X with Brooke Harrington: One of those courses where if the Prof likes you you'll get an A. Interesting guest speakers, interesting material, but lots of reading. Just come to class prepared with lots of relevant talking points from the readings and be an active listener and you'll do fine. Had an oral exam and then a final presentation, so this course really tests how you talk/think on the fly rather than writing skills. Took it out of interest and worked an hour or two before each class and it paid off.\""

Prof. Houle takes a very theory-oriented, question-focused route, which means that all of the stats that he teaches are focused on how to best serve your research question and apply the right model for the job. The math is extremely minimal, as it's mostly focused on classifying the kind of data you have and the kind of question that's being asked, and looking to see what kind of model you should then use. If you don't have STATA experience, it'll probably be fine so long as you have experience in R or other stats software (though you should probably read some of the background stata instructions at the start of class, and attend the X-hour stata overview.) I didn't have any stata experience at all, and was totally fine. The primary focus is in group problem sets/homework, plus a final project (also in a group, unless you want to work on your thesis). If you hate group work, don't take this class, but I had no issues at all and the prof takes care to ensure that everyone pitches in. Prof Houle can be a somewhat strict grader, but it's very possible to get good grades, especially if you ask questions on your final project work ahead of time.

Good side? The course material is really interesting. Bad side? Parsa sucks all life out of it, and his assignments are proposterous. Instead of really LEARNING about the Civil Rights Movement, and the Iranian, Nicaraguan, and Filipino revolutions, you'll get to read dry, boring THEORY about social movement and revolutions.

By his own admission, he had previously been an easy grader, which would have made the class somewhat bearable because at least at the end of it you would have come out with a decent grade.

The professor, when he did speak, was very inflammatory and narrow-minded on the issues - although it is nice to see a professor who's so enthusiastic about his subject matter, but... For the final paper (20 pages to be written during the exam week), he expected us to focus exclusively on one book - the one he wrote - and punished those who incorporated contradictory information from other readings (which he himself assigned).

And although he teaches his courses from an arguably leftist point of view, he is aware and honest about this and makes it clear that that is how the course is to be taught on the first day of class (he admits he is an immigrant from Iran and has always been a subversive)--and such a \"bias\" is not unfound in more right-winged, questionably \"fair\" government or economics courses you'll find at the college.

Prof. Parsa repeated this anecdote to our class about eight times in four weeks, sometimes repeating it twice in one day. He always repeated it with great outrage and passion. It was, of course, an clear and sickening injustice, and the US is a tacit supporter of such oppressive people, as Prof. Parsa took great pains to point out. But hearing this anecdote, and dozens of other personal outrages of Parsa, got very, very, very repetitive. One couldn't help thinking perhaps he did not remember which of his very similar classes he was teaching or what exactly he was lecturing about this week. As long as he had a minimal level of outrage at the world's actions, Parsa was quite content to go through an entire lesson without imparting any useful information at all. Some things in this course, especially in the readings, are useful in understanding different perspectives on why and how countries develop. However, any useful information on, say, the exact way an international corporation influences foreign governments to grant concessions despite the effects on their own population, is very difficult to seperate from the quagmire of Parsa's personal agenda, his tedious outrage, and his pet interests (Iran.)

You can only miss 3 classes the entire term to pass your participation grade, which is extremely frustrating because her lectures are VERY repetitive and boring. All she does is pace back and forth and regurgitate stuff from the reading of the day, occasionally writing a few things on the board. She clearly makes it mandatory to come because she knows no one would show up if it weren't for that rule; unless you are the type of student to raise your hand every 3 minutes to make empty/useless comments for some brownie points, this is not the class for you. I was extremely ill and in the hospital the week before our first paper was due and, therefore, wasn't able to do the readings that for week. I spoke with her and she only gave me one measly day to make up everything. 2. There are 4 papers and a final research paper, all graded HARSHLY. Even though her grading seems structured (points for clarity of explanation, use of sources, etc.), it is completely arbitrary. She pretty much expects perfection in all areas of writing as if the students are English scholars, taking off 1 point here and there which leaves you with anything from a C to a B+ at best. She hasn't written one helpful comment on my papers other than \"what does this mean?\" and maybe some \"word checks\". Talking to her outside of class, she seems like a nice enough person...but she still pretty much expects you to figure things out yourself. While the prompts seem easy and straightforward, there's no real way of being sure you satisfied her. She's knowledgeable of the subject, but can't teach or grade properly to save her life. Painful. I definitely did learn some stuff in this class, but it's not worth your time, let alone 5 grand, to have \"A trusts B to do X\" shoved into your brain 3 times a week.\"",
            "review 2: \"09F with Denise Anthony: The readings are usually on the longish side and aren't that interesting. \"Trust\" is such an abstract concept, the material sometimes can't help but be dry, dense, etc. The bright side is that she doesn't randomly call on people during class, so you only really have to do the readings (or skim, power-source, etc.) for the four mandatory short papers (5-6 pp. each). Each paper is based on a different section of the course... so there was one on trust in the health care system, one on trust on the internet, etc. Anthony is a really nice person. She has a great reputation among students - this being my first class with her, I now see why. She recognized that \"trust\" isn't the most interesting subject in the world but I think she did her best to make it palatable if not intriguing in parts. Also, the other WARNING review for this class written by a 2011 is wrong: you do not FAIL your participation grade if you miss 3 classes. You fail your participation grade if you miss 6 classes or more. Missing more than 3 classes (not 3 classes on the nose) results in a C being the highest possibility for your participation grade. Anthony really knows her stuff and she likes it when you speak up to really say something from your perspective, something original, not just spouting off for brownie points. She IS however a bit of a random grader. Two short papers I really devoted myself to: average grade was 87. Two I just rambled for: average grade was 97. So ... yeah. The only really irritating thing about this class was the final research paper, which judging from past reviews of this same class is a recent addition to the syllabus on Anthony's part (maybe I'm wrong though). It was a pain and you could tell no one felt like doing it. You have to write 12-15 pp. on something related to trust incorporating course readings and independent research. I was not enjoyable. You can pass this class if you're not a Socy major, but I wouldn't recommend taking it if you aren't.\"",

Professor Anthony seemed like she didn't really have a plan for what we were doing, and as a result we just kept going over the same material again and again.

The tests were about as inane as you can get, for example, matching terms without demonstrating any understanding of them and other questions blatantly asking questions about random tiny details of lectures to see if we had actually attended any of them. Professors Hall and Binswanger both would make over-the-top efforts to get people \"involved\" in the 100-member class and then balk when students deviated from their agendas or pointed out contradictions in what they were saying. All this for material that's a combination of high school American history class and what you should have been able to learn if you've ever watched the news in the past decade and a half or so.

The reading was not crucial to the exams. One could have easily asked what the main idea was and been just fine. Except for the fact that some of the material was interesting, I would not have done the reading. As for the tests, they were so specific that it was practically impossible to guess what they were going to ask.

            "review 11: \"02F with Raymond L.: Socy 62 is the worst class I have ever taken at Dartmouth. I am thoroughly disappointed with 1) the lack of organization on the part of the professors, 2) the belittling tone of voice that Binswanger tended to use when students had contradicting opinions, 3) the utterly random and seriously pointless exams which barely had anything to do w/ the readings, much less the course, and 4) the 10-page MINIMUM single-spaced paper (which became single-spaced 2 weeks before it was due. Understand that on the paper guideline that was passed out earlier in the term, it specifically stated that quality, not quantity mattered). Scenario: Students: \"But Professor Hall, when any other professor at Dartmouth says 10 pages, s/he means 10 pages double-spaced. Hall: Uhh..10 pages double-spaced is 5 pages. Right. Also, I think that it is unfair that there was no mention that a second professor, Binswanger, would be teaching the class along w/ Hall. I think that a lot of my fellow classmates had a lot to say about this course in the evaluations; however, the professors conveniently \"forgot\" to bring them to the last day of class and on the day of the exam. Additionally, they were never blitzed out, as the profs said they would be. Basically, I did not enjoy this class, nor do I know anyone else who did. I can honestly say that Sociology 62 has been the most disappointing course I have taken at Dartmouth during my 3 years here and I hope that the Sociology department will do something, ANYTHING, to ameliorate it.\"",

Binswanger and Hall had totally different agendas for the direction of the class and just ended up giving us a way too general overview of urban theory instead of focusing on a few urban issues. Because the professors had no clear theme of the class, all the readings and exams were pointless and completely random. I can honestly say I learned nothing substantial in this class, except that a 10 pages 'obviously' implies it's single space (giving us 3 days notice before thanksgiving that we had to write a 20 page, not 10 page paper). Binswager was disorganized and impatient with students, while Hall's lectures put most of us to sleep. I'm just happy that this nightmare is over. Never ever take this class.\"",
            "review 13: \"02F with Raymond L.: (This is a copy of the course review I submitted at the end of the term. Yea, I hated this class THAT much.) I would like to preface my additional comments by mentioning that I am a senior, and I have never taken a course as terrible as this one in my entire Dartmouth career. Before this term, I never had any idea that professors could be so incompetent. My faith in the school\u2019s hiring practice has vanished, and I have been looking forward to writing this evaluation for the past month and a half. Every day, I dreaded attending this class. Professor Binswanger\u2019s teaching style was so atrocious and haughty that it created for a hostile class atmosphere. Dartmouth should be embarrassed that it made the mistake of giving this man a teaching position. I find it ironic that Professor Binswanger\u2019s focus was education, since he clearly does not know yet how to conduct a college-level class in an open and comfortable manner. In my opinion, a good student-professor relationship is based upon a mutual respect and enthusiasm. Professor Binswanger did not once exhibit even the slightest trace of respect to myself or my classmates. First of all, his method of calling upon students at random to answer his silly and humiliating questions is ridiculous. I understand that class participation is important, but forcing unclear questions upon students in front of a class this large as part of his attempt to avoid the \"traditional\" teaching styles, is just pointless and intimidating, and it creates in the classroom a sense of antagonism. If Professor Binswanger was hoping to encourage students to speak up, then he went about it completely wrong. Instead of spending class periods actually thinking about the topics and developing my own opinions, I spent most of my time fretting that he might call my name out off of his notepad and demand that I answer one of his inane questions. Secondly, Professor Binswanger showed what little respect he has for the class regarding our paper assignment. Never before in my entire Dartmouth experience have I been asked by a professor to write a single-spaced paper. In fact, it is taught as a standard in English 5 (freshman year) that students are to assume that papers should be written double-spaced, unless otherwise specified. Professors Binswanger and Hall assigned on the syllabus a paper that was to be \"10-15 pages\" in length, with no spacing specifications; hence, it was reasonable to assume that double spacing was desired. In a gross display of discourtesy, we (the class) were informed that our paper was, in fact to be 10-15 pages in length single spaced. This doubled the length of the paper into what is comparable to the length of a seminar thesis, and it was done with less than two weeks remaining before the due date. To behave in such a manner toward students and completely alter the nature of a paper in this fashion is unheard of and unforgivable. As a further slap in the face, the teachers acted as if our frustration was unwarranted; they told us that we should never have assumed that the paper would be double spaced. This is interesting, since I know for a fact that the paper assignment for this term in Professor Hall\u2019s other Sociology class was, in fact, required to be a more suitable 10 pages, double spaced. My final complaint is that both examinations were unfair. Not a single one tested sufficiently the material covered in class. Questions were ludicrous and obviously intended to trick students who had actually done the reading. I studied well for both exams, and I knew the material as well as I possibly could have. This did not matter at all. I still fared poorly. The professors should have tested us on the material that was important; instead, they chose to focus on the most trivial of facts. For example, on the midterm, 21 points were garnered by a matching section in which we were to match authors with the books that they had written. The only problem with this section was that: the books had never been assigned as reading, nor had they been expounded upon in any way whatsoever. One day in class, they had merely been listed on the chalkboard as an afterthought. This section on the test comprised a large portion of the total points, yet it did not even begin to graze the topics we were expected to know, as described on the syllabus or the study guide. In general, this course is an embarrassment to the school. Every single other student I spoke to in the class echoes my complaints as well. Professor Binswanger contributed to the worst class I have ever had the misfortune of taking. I had never taken a class in the Sociology department before, and after the injustice of Sociology 62, I will never take another.\"",

This was probably because, unlike the ORC listing, the class was actually taught by two people and thus the style of the class was changed. I hope that future students do not have to sit thru the torture that my fellow classmates and I sat thru this term.\""

If only one person asked for one, she would respond with \"I cannot do that because then I would have to for everyone.\" Of course, this is not to say that she would not with excruciating circumstances. I have yet to meet a professor with this same mindset, as we all must acknowledge that there are times certain students receive more privileges than others. I do want to point out what the other reviewer said about how she handled the class. There were instances where the class did feel uncomfortable because generalizations were made by students who have not acknowledged their own privilege despite identifying as women (avoiding conversations about race and class). In fact, one student said that all women wait for men... yeah no, and yet, the professor did not point out how we must avoid making such generalizations because this just propagates stereotypes. I am not trying to say that the professor is at fault for this, but I do wish that privileges were addressed more in class.\""

Just be prepared to devote some time to the few assignments when they do arise. Prof. King is definitely an interesting teacher and an effective lecturer whose prison knowledge is bound to interest people. The latitude she gave the class in terms of final paper topics (where people incorporate their own interests relating to religion, race, politics, science, etc.) and even in terms of the small project (journal, board game) made the non-test assignments rather enjoyable. While she did get sick towards the end of term and had to cancel 3 MWF classes, I wouldn't discredit her for that. She is a very caring professor that is really concerned about how her students are doing and went out of her way to provide extra sources and help to fine-tune our papers. While I never did remember her office hours, practically every time I would walk into her office she'd be there, whether it would be in the middle of the afternoon or after 5pm. She'd always ask how we were doing and if things are okay. If work is really bogging you down and you need a minor extension, she'd probably be nice enough to grant you it.

The midterm was much more specific than she had said it would be; some of the questions asked for the tiniest of details instead of focusing on broad concepts.

Often when we did have class she showed videos instead of lecturing. When classes ended she still had not returned our midterms, so no one has any idea how they're doing in the class. She did not respond to blitzes and overall was extremely irresponsible. In her true form, she cancelled the final class of the term, so the class never had the chance to fill out evaluations.

Houle let us out of class early one day, just because we all seemed tired and uninterested, and on the mental health day, we didn't use the x-hour instead or anything.

There is lots of \"assigned\" reading but you can easily do none of it and not be affected at all (some of it is pretty interesting though). Class attendance was not required, and I think Walton almost didn't want everyone to show up. In the past this was a 30 person class, but this term it was 70 people, so she cut lots of the assignments. I think the large class size made her uncomfortable, especially during the period of the term when COVID was everywhere and when the flu was rampant, so she made a few of our classes zoom and made it super super easy to not attend lectures. It seems like Walton didn't like the way this term went though and likely will make this course smaller and harder in the future (but I don't think this class could every really be that difficult).

If you wanted to take away lot from this class you could do every reading. If you wanted to learn some interesting stuff but not put in the work you could just show up to class and listen. The assignments we had were a one paper 3-5 pages, 4 one page response memos over that day's readings, and the final project which was a five minute presentation over anything related to the course.

The response memos were graded a little more in-depth, but as long as you actually incorporate ideas from the text and add one additional idea/connection, you will do fine. Sharp does not like when you quote text, try to paraphrase, especially in the response memos. The first paper was super easy and was a reflection on a 5-day behavioral change (could be drinking more water, meditation, or working out), and the second was a little more self-directed. It was a research paper about why a specific marginalized group (of your choosing) experiences a health disparity (of your choosing).

And, as we progress, we have to relate what we're newly learning to theories we've already discussed, and simply regurgitating facts laid out by Dixon in class will at best get you a B+ or A-; there is some personal interpretation and novel thought required in order to achieve an A (not that that's everything).

Attendance counts heavily, and you will WANT to come - I was always EXTREMELY behind on the readings but since I went to almost every class, I never fell behind and always knew enough to say something cogent. Also, I don't think Dixon is a harsh grader. Just be insightful and succinct with what you say and back it up with facts. Dixon gives you the benefit of the doubt since the tests are all timed and he knows he asks for a lot.

I'd say there is no grade inflation, and you don't receive any gifts. But maybe that's a good thing; you learn to write tightly argued papers out of necessity.

Some classes dragged, with him going over details he already had, or just somehow getting bogged down in details while still unclear about the overall picture.

This course really probed the \"why\" rather than simply dictating the \"what.\" Professor Parsa was clearly passionate about the subject, and passionate in general. He has his opinions but doesn't mind disagreement. However, he will sometimes venture on to tangents during lectures, which are interesting but often not pertinent or helpful for the papers. There were two essays and one research paper, all of which were manageable. The directions for all of them were very open-ended, which may or may not be good depending on what you prefer.

The class opens your eyes regarding revolutions, the factors that lead to social change. Not only do you get great subject matter, but Prof Parsa is the expert on the subject. You use his own textbook in class, which is widely respected and possibly the most comprehensive and intellectual recent text in the field. This man knows his stuff - he doesn't use lecture notes, rarely uses the blackboard. He sits with the students at the table and just talks. And somehow, what he says makes sense and really makes you understand the subject. You can easily tell that he knows a lot about the subject. The class does get a little hard at times. Some of the readings are unnecessarily complicated, but you don't have to do all the readings, just the ones relevant to the papers. There are no exams. SOme of the papers can be complicated, but they are very interesting to write and allow for some creative license. The class dynamic is also very interesting. There are only 15 people in the seminar. Everybody sits around the table and just talks. Very laid back. Since it was a 2A, we usually took a break an hour in and got popcorn. Parsa also shows a lot of videos, and these are great. They connect visual images to what you read, allowing you to gain a greater understanding of what exactly happened.

Third positive, he's a friendly guy and you get popcorn every class. Now for the negative. His office hours are two hours a week, Wednesday 8-10.

His method of \"teaching\" is to show a video for half the class, and then for the rest of class rant about how evil the United States is. You can tell when he's about to insult the U.S. because his voice gets all low and raspy, like he's letting you into a dirty little secret. \"It's an outrage\", \"fascist\" and \"dee oil!\" are the buzzwords heard in 90% of his lectures. If you raise a point that goes against his personal views he will dismiss you as a misguided right-wing radical and ridicule you whenever he gets the opportunity for the rest of the term. The assignments are inane. One of the essays regards a quote from Ayatollah Khomeini. The assignment is: \"How would [two prominent sociologists] react to this claim? How would Parsa REJECT these analyses?\" This is pretty much the tone for all the essays- step kowtow to Parsa or suffer. Kind of ironic for someone who is so vehemently anti-fascist. Good things about the class: the professor is Iranian, so he has a cool accent that is fun to listen to, and is well versed in Iran. The only assignments were three essays, so the workload wasn't too bad (although there is a LOT of required reading). And as long as you show up for class you are guaranteed at least a C in the class (although A's are extremely hard to get). Conclusion: Do not register for this class. If you are already in this class, switch out of it. Before it's too late.\"",

Anything liberal is good, anything Republican is, of course, a direct order from the devil himself. At least 3 or 4 times per class he will recap his lastest \"outrage\" with the world, which he will remind you of in every subsequent class, in case you forgot. Needless to say, he enjoys repeating himself, a fact made painfully apparent in the book he wrote which is required for the course. In effect, the course is not taught by Parsa. In reality he serves more as a babysister for us immature and juvenile freshmen. We learned everything in the class from the readings and the movies we watch in class.

Oh, and the papers had nothing to do with the class discussion, obviously cause there wasn't a discussion just a one-sided anti-American lecture, or the lovely movies he showed.

We had to write a two-page reaction paper each week, but this was easy too-just a summary and then your thoughts on the reading. Class discussions were good, sometimes Eva had trouble disagreeing with students without giving decent reasons for her position, but after taking the class, you realize how right she was. We had to do field work, ie. volunteering with poor people in some way each week. This was easy, fun, and she was really flexible about what types of positions fulfilled the requirement.

Towards the end of the course I found myself losing interest in the repetitive concepts we were discussing, and I have concluded that while I am glad I took this course, it has shown me that I will probably never take another Sociology course. That said, it was a relatively interesting class, and a good first-year seminar. The readings were engaging, although there were so many that it was difficult (and unnecessary) to do them all. Class discussions were mostly pretty good, although I found that Prof. Fodor's teaching style tended to cut off a lot of the freeform discussion before it could really develop. She is rather biased and defnitely leans to the left, and at the beginning of the term I had a few heated arguments with her in class over some of the stuff we were talking about. A lot of the readings I think reflected that, but the arguments presented were ultimately thorough and convincing.

I eagerly tried to move discussion to affirmative action on numerous times - both me and other people in the class wanted to hear what we all had to say about it - but the professor shut that down. She instead wanted to talk about what her expertise was, and not a divisive and controversial topic like affirmative action.

The tests consist of very few questions for the amount of material covered (40 and 50), and did not properly correllate to the points stressed in lectures. Some of the questions on the final especially were extremely unfair and were not properly addressed in neither the readings nor the lectures. I personally feel shafted after attending an overwhelming majority of the lectures and doing most of the readings, as well as putting in a disproportionate amount of time studying. I received a grade far below what I had expected and far below what I believe was fair for the amount of work I had put into the course and the level of comprehension of the material I believe I established.

If you do the work, you should have no problem with the questions. The readings are extremely interesting, you won't bore of the reading. The only thing is that there are 7 books (each about 200 pages long) that you have to read. You'll prob shell out 80-100 bucks on it.

You have to do the reading for his tricky multiple choice but if you've been paying attention in class, the reading usually goes pretty fast because you're pretty familiar with the material.

The reading was light, averaging about 25 to 40 pages per class. The books on economic equality are very compelling and good reads. The only drawback to this class is the group paper on life at Dartmouth. It allows for serious contemplation about your experiences here and how they are shaped but some groups had difficulty with dividing the work equally. The tests were multiple choice and evenly distributed between the reading and lectures. If you kept up with the reading and then reviewed everything the night before, you were fine.

The class was completely lectures, taking notes on terms from slides, and exams were just memorizing the definitions and examples of terms in sociology. The class was graded on about 45% exams (two exams, exam 1 covering the first half of content and exam 2 the second half), 45% book reviews (3 book reviews), and 10% participation from in-class quick thought submissions. On the book reviews--yes, you do have to read three books--but they're fairly easy to read and not that long, and to be honest the book reviews are manageable even if you didn't have a great understanding of the book. Stockstill also offers to take a look at your review/critique of the book before you turn it in. If you take advantage of that, you can get much better grades on those reviews. Overall, this was a great class with a great professor. Stockstill is compassionate and even cracks jokes, so it makes her lectures interesting and engaging.
