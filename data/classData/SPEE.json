Not that it would have mattered if we could hear her though, because her lectures were read directly from a script and she didn't indicate she actually understood the topics she was teaching at all. The quizzes, midterm, and final were all multiple choice with extremely stupid questions. Instead of relevant vocab questions, she asks about topics that appear only on one line in the textbook and were, at best, tangentially related to anything we were hoping to learn. Lastly, her big essay requires you to write about a real experience you've had in the health field. Not only does this require you to have had or witnessed a health emergency, but also to write about it. It's incredibly inappropriate and so obviously out of bounds to ask students to recall exact conversations to the word they had years before the course and also to analyze them for a professor they have no prior relationship with.

Not only do you become a better speaker, but the class is very much designed for you to retain the knowledge long after Dartmouth in a way few if any other classes at Dartmouth are. The feedback is great, very detailed from Compton and nice to have a range of advice as students also give advice to each other after each speech. As the other 23S review noted, you speak a lot. It seems daunting at first, but you get into it the rhythm of it pretty quickly, and become much less nervous. Your great is mostly (80 or 85%, I forget) speaking + self-evaluations in writing for each speech, with other short writing assignments (a 3-pg double-spaced essay at the end of term and a couple Canvas posts) making up the rest of your grade. This class is not difficult, but it is not layup in that it requires you to put a good amount of time into crafting, practicing, and evaluating your speeches.
