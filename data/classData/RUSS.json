There were students of varying language skill levels, so it was tough to accommodate them all -- some probably were bored, some stressed out and uncomprehending. But overall, Prof. Loseff gives a good rundown of key themes from great Russian literature. The reading concentrated on poetry, which made translations easier (nothing longer than a couple pages, really). The papers were sometimes tough, being in Russian and all, but you have a chance to go over them with the professor before you present them (read them aloud in class), so they end up going ok usually. Some people think Loseff goes through things a bit slow, but it's very helpful to ensure comprehension, and it's obvious he knows what he's talking about, so he will get his point across. Plus, it's just fun to hear him recite the poetry sometimes, too. Also, Misha Gronas stepped in for a few class, and it was a good change of pace.

I left intrigued by his questions, and the class developed a great camaraderie. My only complaint is that the second half of the course's title is \"The Problem of Evil.\" That seems a little misleading, as we didn't get into any great questions of theodicy in a class that deals with a devoutly Christian author.

If you want a professor that knows how to teach, then this class isn\u2019t for you. The class is taught like a seminar, which is a huge pedagogical dilemma, because none of the students ever have anything worthwhile to say, even though they all think they do. Kopper loves to call on people for ideas, but nothing concrete is ever established. Nobody in the class ever seemed to say anything worthwhile/informative, including Kopper himself, who did not give one effective lecture. Because Kopper is inept the class was forced to watch terrible adaptations of Dostoevsky's work on several occasions. These adaptations would have been acceptable had they pertained to the discussion or the lectures, but it seemed as though Kopper needed to fill class time and he could think of no better way. The assignments are absolutely absurd and because of the 10 week term students are forced to read 250 pages/class.

After second year, you can start to look at jobs in Russia. Anyway - amazing class, so much fun, and absolutely essential if you want to make use of your first-year Russian skills.\"",

Instead of just reviewing technicalities for days on end and showing up frostbitten in Winter for the 745 drill to recite case heavy jingles - you actually get to experience real Russian stories, poetry, essays, and films. Professor Rakova is great and deals with each student according to their strengths and weaknesses in the language - so even if you didn't go to Saint Pete's - you'll be just fine. She will make sure that you're learning a lot and not getting left behind in any area. She's the real deal, don't miss it because you're lazy.\""

However, the quizzes are only 5% of the grade total (1% each), and if you even skim the readings you can do fine on them.

            "review 14: \"04F with Mikhail Gronas: Whatever your reasons for taking this course, be forewarned that Russian 13 has become much harder over the years and you have to stay atop the readings to do well. The course has an unusual time format of two 65-minute lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, and a mandatory 50-minute discussion section every Thursday or Friday. When you are assigned a discussion day, you must go to that assigned section; you are not allowed to flip-flop between Thursday and Friday sessions. You should pray that the class has a high enrollment because that will mean discussion sections will not be all fielded by Dr. Sevastianova, who is by far the harshest of the discussion section graders. I was fortunate enough to have a masters\u2019 student who thought that anything we said was extraordinarily profound. Discussion counts for a significant portion of your grade and you are allotted only one absence without it affecting your course assessment. You are entitled to three free misses in lecture without it hurting your grade. The professors make no distinction between excused and unexcused absences, so use your freebies wisely. Attendance in lecture is helpful because the notes you do take will complement the outlines posted on blackboard. I\u2019ve been told that you don\u2019t even need to take notes. Well, it can\u2019t hurt to listen to the professors. Regarding the midterm and the final (each of which have 25 multiple choice questions and a choice of one of two essays), you really have to strike a chord with the professors to do well. My midterm essay got a 50/50, but I\u2019ve read essays that were honestly better than mine and those people got lower grades. Consider it an erratic grading policy, if you will; but that is my only small objection to an otherwise wonderful class. The reader is, unfortunately, a little pricey and you should probably just borrow one from someone else who has already taken the course. The professors so far haven\u2019t changed the reader\u2019s contents since Spring 2004, but that could obviously change. There are five unannounced quizzes based on the readings. Be VERY careful when reading over the syllabus because the assignment listed alongside a date is due THE NEXT LECTURE. Lots of people got tripped up by this and entered a quiz having read for what was essentially the next lecture, so they got trussed up. Then again, the quizzes only constitute 5% of your grade. Sevastianova is (barely) the better of the two lecturers, with Gronas\u2019 only drawback being that he has a slight accent. But before you hop in, consider the class averages of the course\u2019s graded components for Fall 2004: Quiz 1: 3.15/5 (Weight, 1%) Quiz 2: 2.79/5 (1%) Quiz 3: 2.79/5 (1%) Quiz 4: 2.69/5 (1%) Quiz 5: 3.88/5 (1%) Lecture Attendance Grade: 21.24/22 (15%) Discussion Grade: 91.27/100 (25%) Midterm Examination Grade: 82.18/100 (25%) Final Examination Grade: 85.87/100 (30%) You do the math. The \u201caverage RUSS 13 Fall 2004 student\u201d only got about an 86.67 on the course. I really don\u2019t care about grades and only wanted to put the INT aside. So choose wisely.\"",

The midterm and essay were really not that bad at all but the essay portion of the test seemed to be really subjective and was sometimes hard to understand why someone got all 50 pts while another got like 40 pts.

This is really stupid, because for any Dartmouth student, the difficulty of the content in this course will bring you back to your elementary school days. The Professor puts lecture slides on Blackboard which are purposefully unhelpful. The readings do not cover a lot of what she goes over in class. There is no reason why she couldn't make her published slides more comprehensive or put on reserve whatever resources she uses to come up with lectures.

As for the readings, several of them were quite good (the book of Russian Fairy Tales, Dracula) but others were terribly boring (Perkowski's The Darkling, for one). This review ripped this course apart and I apologize for that. It really is a good and interesting course - just with some major structural flaws. Should you take it?

This class was EXTREMELY easy, both in terms of the workload and the difficulty of the tests, and also had a huge curve due to the size. Essentially, I don't think it was possible for someone to get less than a C in the class, and that would be without any effort whatsoever. Loseff was not an effective lecturer at all, and he got sidetracked way too often. His thick Russian accent was hard to understand at first, but after a few classes I got used to that. He had a TA, though, who taught about half the lectures, so it didn't really matter. Overall, if you're looking for an extremely easy gut class that definitely doesn't require, or even warrent, attendance the majority of the time, and has little to no work, but doesn't necessarily inspire interest in the subject, this is the class for you!\"",

In terms of the course material, I found it to be very interesting although not particularly challenging. Many students got away with not reading. The papers are frequent, but fairly graded and drafts can be re-written. Much of the reading is from authors not of Russian background, but it all is tied together and makes sense in the end.

He brings typed lectures to class, which he reads from in a slow, thick, Russian accent. Furthermore, his lectures are almost completely irrelevant to the novel we should be discussing. when we read The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, he spent an hour talking about the city of Prague because Kafka was from Prague. Class discusssion made up only 15% of the class at best, some periods would go by without a single student speaking.
