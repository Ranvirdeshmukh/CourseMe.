He is extremely boing, with a monotone voice. When he teaches he goes way off topic and digresses much too often. The subjects he teaches are irrelevant tot the course. he also asks broad questions with multiple answers, but claims only his answer is correct. They are also not too easy on the grading. Would not recommend this class unless you are a film studies major truly interested. Does not teach much about Africa, more so European influence to Africa.\""

Let me begin by saying I took it ASYNCHRONOUSLY which I'd imagine won't be the case if it's offered again but still I think would be a great class. I feel like I really easily got my CI/ART without it being SUCH a layup that I felt guilty. The class (async) lectures were honestly interesting and the relevant readings each week were cool too, with discussion post threads that legitimately stimulated my interest and thoughts on the subjects. Grading was 30% participation for completing discussion sections, 20% of a straightforward midterm that was a combo of MC from the lectures and asking you to briefly reflect on readings/films from the course, 20% a short paper which was honestly pretty cool to do which entailed using newspapers from ca. 1915 to investigate the premiere of and reaction to a deeply problematic film, and 30% a final paper (only 6-8 pages) on any remotely relevant moviegoing topic of your choosing. Awesome class. Very doable and flexible, while at the same time offering interesting material and thought provoking assignments. Potentially my favorite course at Dartmouth so far and I'm a bio major that loves bio classes. Recommend to ANYONE (film majors? for sure; need a CI and/or ART? take it; just want an easy and interesting class alongside your others for the term? sign up).

The structure goes like this: two movies assigned per week plus some readings (and a discussion post). A couple students lead a discussion based on those materials and the whole class engages. Sounds simple yet it's quite effective. Beyond that, it's just a final! Not too shabby at all! You can write a 18 page paper, make a podcast + a 4 page paper, or do an art piece with an 8 page paper for that final. The last day of class, he brought us pizza and gave a little speech about how important this class was to him. I legitimately teared up. He is one of those professors that is intimidating, not because he is scary or intense, simply because you crave his approval. He is so eloquent and kind and just exactly what a professor should be.

This class was a 6B so usually Professor Garcia talked about the previous week's films for the first hour and then we watched a film for next week. Overall the films were really good, such as Moonlight, Enter the Dragon, etc. In terms of assessment, I found this class kind of unfair. We had two film identification exams where she played a five second clip of a film and we had to identify which film it came from. The issue with this was if you didn't pay attention to the most random, five second clip of a movie, you were sort of screwed, even if you watched the majority of the films in depth. We also had two bibliography assignments which were pretty straightforward. Then, you were graded on participation and a final video compilation project. It's not entirely clear what she's looking for in terms of participation. The class is in BVAC which makes the discussions sort of difficult to participate in since everyone is spread out. Professor Garcia is also incredibly impersonal -- it seemed as though she was looking for reasons to take points off and give people a hard time even though this was conceptually not a difficult class whatsoever.

The workload in general is not too bad. You have to watch 2-3 movies (1-2 hours each) a week to prepare for the tests which are fairly disappointing in nature.

If there was another professor who taught this course that was more organized, lenient (I will get into this later), and more clear, then I would suggest taking this course because there is some interesting material about the inner workings of journalism. However, I was let down tremendously due to how the professor \"structured\" the class. First, the syllabus was not put together well, making it difficult to see what needs to be done before class. The instructions for some of the assignments were not clear either. Next, speaking of assignments, the professor expected too much out of the students to complete towards the last weeks of the class. As mentioned in another review, he expected us to complete a video project, research paper, and then a final exam (that consisted of two short essays). If the length of the assignments were shortened, then they would have felt less like a chore to complete given the time frame. On top of all of that, the professor never gave back any written feedback on the assignments we completed in the previous weeks (or on any assignment at all), so students never knew what they needed to improve on in the class. Lastly, the class itself was mostly dull which is something that I personally was not expecting considering how the subject of the class is hugely dynamic. The course was half historical, half production, but the production was mainly done outside of the class. I felt that if more production was done during the class, it definitely would have improved the state of the class. The professor would lecture sometimes here and there. Then, there were some videos/movies played in class and several guests were invited to speak to the class. I enjoyed some of the guests as I thought they were insightful, but some things that were discussed strayed away from the lectures that the professor had given, so I was often left wondering how it connected. Anyways, if you read this far, I hope that I have convinced you enough to not take this course with Professor Williams.\"",
            "review 2: \"19S with Mark Williams: This was probably the worst class I've taken at Dartmouth. The professor is terribly unorganized and would assign up to 300 pages of reading per night, but never mention anything about the readings in class. He speaks monotonically about random topics for two hours straight before ending class, at which time each and every student is drained but also very thankful that they made it through yet another awful lecture. He also did not smooth out the workload throughout the term to a fair, consistent amount. In the beginning of the term, there really wasn't much to do outside of the readings, but in the last two weeks of the term, he gave us a final exam, final project, and a final paper, which, considering the size he expected of each project, is far beyond the workload expected in any other class here at Dartmouth. Additionally, he didn't return graded work back in a timely manner \u2013 the first assignment we received feedback occurred in week 9 when he gave us out exams that we took in week 5, yet somehow he expects us to learn from our previous assignments and improve from one to the next. Overall, I highly advise against taking this class if it is with Professor Williams, no matter how interesting the material may seem. He will make it boring either way, and then you'll just have to put up with having him as a prof and taking an awful class.\""

It started out great, but as the term progressed, the assignments just got more and more intense and I ended up pulling nearly weekly all-nighters and still wasn't turning in work that made Flanagan happy. She's also the least understanding prof I've ever had. Every time someone got sick and couldn't make it to class (keep in mind COVID was prevalent), their grade was docked, and she didn't care what you had going on outside class, you weren't getting an extension and she was going to shame you for asking for one. She was a real stickler for attendance, which I usually don't mind, but she'd count you absent and dock your grade for being even a minute late. She threatened to fail me at the end of the term even though my grade in the class was a low A up to that point. I don't think any of this even begins to describe how much her treatment of students damaged my mental health. Do I think I learned something in this class? Sure. Was being denied extensions due to unavoidable circumstances worth it? No. Take this class if you're interested, but know what you're getting yourself into. NOT a layup.

Class was mostly dedicated to discussion about assigned readings and viewings, so you had to speak often. The textbook readings could get tedious, but it's the TV episodes and respective texts that livened up the workload. Additionally, there were 3 sets of short (500-1000 word) essays about the material spaced out throughout the term. These assignments were actually quite fun to complete, as Prof. Young allowed for some creative liberty in your responses. Each Wednesday, there was a comprehension quiz on 1 or 2 readings or viewings. These quizzes were not difficult provided you actually did the work.

I've been very interested in film my whole life and was considering a minor, but after this class I might not. The class was small, only about 13 people, and while you think that would make for good discussion and community, it did not. The environment was very awkward and no one really talked to each other, even though I know people in the class are talkative and social people. This environment was a result of Ruoff and his teaching style. He is a very nice man, however, he would often ask very awkward questions that would inhibit discussion and make people feel uncomfortable. Also most of the questions he asked the class during discussion were not open-ended and often had only one answer, which was not conducive to people sharing their opinions or thinking critically. There was also a huge disparity between people that really liked film and those that were there for the credit. Don't get me wrong I have great respect for people who are interested in other things and take a film class for the art distributive because they are curious, but I honestly think Introduction to Film should be a prerequisite for this course because it is very hard to think critically about films from these new wave genres if you do not know film techniques or history and have never analyzed a movie before. Professor also cold calls a lot and when people are not interested enough to do the readings, their comments are just bullshit and the whole discussion turns into people commenting on material they haven't read in order to get participation. The workload isn't a lot if you don't do the readings. The readings are incredibly dense, but will interest you if you are interested in film. Although they were really tough to get through sometimes, I actually did learn a lot from the theory readings. If you're just interested in learning theory- pick up Bazin's What is Cinema? and you will learn as much as I did in this class. Otherwise, there is only one 4-page paper, one website project (which was not very hard, but it is a group project and he only gives you one grade so if you get a shitty partner you're kind of screwed), and a final project of either a 4 minute video essay (with partner) or 8-page paper (without partner). Choose the video essay- I chose the paper and it was a mistake. Ended with an A, but I also put in a lot of effort because this is a subject I care about, others were not as lucky. TLDR: Don't take this class unless you are VERY interested in film and its history. I love movies and part of me wishes that I dropped it and took something more engaging. A is not super easy to get. Professor is kind, but weird and not a good teacher.\"",

It is, of course, not without pitfalls. Allowing students much independence is one of the main strengths of the course, but it also can actually become a serious weakness. Students come in with a wide range of experience, and for some, the initial pace and amount of self-initiative expected might just be too much.

If you have other intense, time-consuming courses, you might want to think over carefully before signing up. I think, however, the amount of time commitment can be well controlled by not going too far ahead of yourself. I had some more time, so I spent much of my time on the course, but I think depending on the students' schedules, the time commitment does not necessarily have to be extreme. We are not trying to produce Oscar-winning movies, after all. Another weakness I saw was the organization. The lectures I felt often lacked focus and the prof. was not always prompt with giving hand-outs on time. The teacher remedied this problem a great deal by holding extremely helpful ono-on-one biweekly sessions, but it still can't hurt to be a little bit more organized. If you have an interest in film and want to produce a crazy little short film, this class will serve your needs well. Just be aware of the time commitment and the self-initiative required.\"",

A lot. We watched movies in class, talked about filmmaking, and basically learned how to direct by actually directing. There was some instruction for how to direct, but most of the learning came from actually filming and from reading the Mackendrick book that was assigned.

Yes, you have to put 20 hours a week into this class. But you can do it. It's not \"thinking\" work. So I would watch tv or listen to music while I animated. I found the animating \"homework\" relaxing, rather than stressful, because I just got to draw and catch up on tv shows. I'm a varsity athlete, and I could still put in the work for this class because I enjoyed it so much. You'll like this class so much that you'll find time to do the work, trust me.

This is because I found this class, Animation, to be a great combination of my interests (and majors) in studio art in biology. I felt it realized the best of each subject, and so I spent the term focusing on naturalistic animation involving human, animal, and insect movement. It was a great class, with a great prof. As our workload increased with each animation project, David offered more and more of his time and resources, and by the final project, he had started supplying us with food, drink, even a sleeping bag at the studio. Many students used it. The 20 hours described as the expected workload for this class is no exaggeration. We spent an average of 15-25 hours a week on animation alone, and I also took another art class at the same time that required 10 hours of outside work. It was not easy, and it's recommended that you take this with just one other class. Given everything, I highly recommend this class, even (and maybe especially) to those who don't consider themselves artistic. Animation requires a lot more than artistic talent, and there are many different ways to create an animated short - clay, mosaic, motion capture, and traditional drawing. Again, great class, and great prof. This class requires passion, dedication, and motivation!\"",

Each student in our class developed a wholey unique style. By the end you will be wanting to learn more, and make up for all your lost sleep, but contrary to popular opinion it is possible to get sleep if you pace yourself well.

Ehrlich pushes every member of the class individually, and he really tried to find something unique for everyone to work on. He was very supportive and encouraging throughout the entire class. Any class with this man is worth your time. Also, the bonds created between everyone in the class was uncanny- there were 12 people who were really really different, who probably wouldnt get along under normal circumstances... and who ended up to be really good friends. overall the class is worth the agony, but try to only take one other class in whatever term you're taking it.\"",

It is really fun and didn't actually feel like a class, it just felt like a place that I wanted to spend as much time in as possible. The entire course is a workshop in animation, so the course had 4 small animation projects and one month long culminating project that was shown in the dartmouth film festival in the spring. In class was devoted to watching animation and critiquing other students work. This class was a great deal of work, especially the last month of it. I would recommend taking a two course load if you choose to take this course because you will want to spend all your time doing the work for this class and spending time with the other students. I left this class with a love for animation as well as a group of close friends who I absolutely love. The only negative aspect of this class is that many of the students in the course were seniors and graduated shortly after I got to know them. I will miss them all terribly, but they will always be a part of who I am. I bring this up because if you take this class, you spend all term with the people in your animation class and you will grow to love them until it feels like you are part of a family of crazy and wonderful animators.

It was fairly easy as well. That having been said, I have two main complaints. First, Professor Phillips, who is super smart, kind, and qualified, is also... old... and a little long-winded / seems to be going senile. I feel bad saying this, but I include it because it was a detriment on the class and the workshop that he would spend so much time talking about random unrelated stuff or his director friend who did this that or the other movie. I wish all the class time had been used for teaching or workshop. That having been said, Phillips is fair and lets you write about anything you want. He does not play favorites and has a real investment in everyone's work. Second drawback: fellow students were all at totally different levels of writing, which meant sometimes we were workshopping stuff that was simply not ready to be workshopped. Phillips does not provide tons of fiction / writing advice, so if you are unsure of your abilities in that area, I highly encourage you to take an Intro writing class in the creative writing dept. before you take this one. Nor can Phillips steer the workshop in a very helpful manner. If people start going off topic / telling anecdotes / whatever, he does not stop them.

He is full of practical and amusing advice, which is just how it should be in this instance. A theoretical approach to screenwriting would be completely worthless, and luckily, Phillips sees that. Anyone who has watched a number of movies should have a basic intuition for how a film's story should be developed and structured. The class is all just hands on experience writing and getting feedback. He does a good job helping students learn how to use Final Draft, which is the main benefit to taking this course. I think formatting is the major issue that stands between potential screenwriters and those who actualy end up doing it. So for that alone, this class is incredibly worthwhile. My only complaints: the class gets off to a slow start, and few of the other people in the class were annoying and wrote really bad scripts, and it was painful to comment on them. It seems that with an application process, these people could and should have been weeded out. I'm not sure what happened, however, that is not really a fault of the professor so much as the quality of applicants (most likely). Some people should never take screenwriting because they will never be good at it and that is all there is to it. Professor Phillips falls very much on the realism side of the fence when it comes to making films, but he encourages students to follow their visions rather than conforming to his aesthetics, and for that, I admire him immensely.

As for professor Phillips, he is a nice guy, but he gets confused by modern references in screenplays and I feel he can be ineffective in commenting on the meat of the screenplay story because he focuses on the technical aspects. He is extremely helpful with his comments on technical aspects, but you don't need a full course to learn that. As for grading, that is a bit arbitrary too.

It's fun to watch movies as homework, and talk about your favorite actors and directors in class.

He will answer your questions and will teach you a lot and help you if you ask him, but don't expect to learn too much in class by default. You'll just be learning by doing and by refering to the text book.

Ruoff's lectures and the films he selected for screening gave me a real appreciation of film history around the world--the French New Wave, Italian Neorealism, New German Cinema, etc. etc. This class was a 3A: on Mondays we saw a film, and on Thursdays we discussed it and Ruoff lectured on its historical context. We only had to watch two films outside of class--one for two papers (a short response paper and a longer, more focused paper); the second for the final paper. Ruoff administered two exams, for which we had to identify key terms. The tests give you a sense of what knowledge Ruoff wants you to walk away with. A fun class! Ruoff knows his stuff.

The breadth of films studied is impressive, and class discussions were engaging more often than not. The biggest problems in the course came from Professor Williams, including: - letting the class out late every period - changing assigned readings without telling anyone - vague descriptions or answers to questions These are not insurmountable problems, especially if one is prepared for them, but they are annoying.

However, Film History II chose the unfortunate path of focusing on all of the uninteresting parts of film history. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that I can't stand neorealism, and the entire course seemed to hinge on realism and neorealism. Thankfully we at least touched upon wonderful genres like film noir and intriguing situations like the blacklist, but I would've liked to spend more time on them and less time on Italy. Subject material aside, however, my main quarrel with the course was that I received no feedback. My midterm exam was returned to me with a number written next to each short answer and a number written at the top of my essay. Not a single comment had been written on my exam, and therefore I had no idea why points had been deducted or what on earth I was supposed to study for the next time. It was extremely frustrating, especially since I thought that I had performed rather well, and the numbers written down did not correspond to how I thought I had done. On the plus side, however, Williams gave us total free reign in choosing our final paper topics, and encouraged us to really go out and research something that inspired us and that we wouldn't have the chance to research for ourselves otherwise. I really respect that. Moral of the story: a class that is not terribly interesting and affords little to no feedback, but gives the opportunity to write an awesome paper.\"",

This was my first class in the department. i thought that we'd be watching movies and then talking about their content. However, this class is more like art history than english (not that there's anything wrong with that.) But it's more like you watch the movie, and then talk about the movement it belongs too, the director of the film, and the cultural, historical, industrial, and theoretical background of the film and its director. But you do watch really good films, films that I know I would've never have watched ever. And film history is a very cultural experience. I mean, how can you go through life and not know Van Gogh, or Rembrant? Like, in film, it's the same thing only the painters are replaced with guys like Ozu and Sirk. I call this class a sort of bootcamp because Professor Williams is a very academic type guy. I mean, that your papers and exams and stuff have to be very super thorough. And plus you only get three grades for the term: a midterm, a final paper, and the final. So you must do well on those. He gives a lot of reading, of which you must read if you want to perform well on the midterm and final. Most people i know, including myself read them all the couple of nights before the tests. But overall, i felt that i gained a great understanding of film during this period and I'm pretty happy that i now know what all those terms i've always heard of, but never knew what they meant, like: neo-realism, the french new wave, or poetic realism.

For example, in a week and a half period, we watched two different movies about protagonists dying from stomach cancer (Diary of a Country Priest and Ikiru).

Miraculously, they were always 1 day after the papers were due. The class itself is a strange mix of history and art - in your papers, you evaluate and the artistic choices of the filmmakers, and talk about how history affected those choices over time. So be prepared not only to learn the history, but more importantly to analyze individuals scenes from films for the editing, cinematography, mise-en-scene, and acting techniques used.

If you try to fit more on a page using Times New Roman size 11, or even 11.5, don't. She gets pissed. And also, when she says double spaced, she doesn't mean 1.5 spaced, which most teachers don't notice. Stick with 12 and double, and stay within the page limits.

I think she may have realized how easy the first was, and the second demanded much more knowledge and the power of observation. Focus is a little bit too much on the films than on her students -- her enthusiasm for the films(which occasionally borders on the excessive and feels forced)rendered her unable to discuss the films with her students.

Even films that had very little bearing on the course (\"Our Dancing Daughters\" and \"Applause\") would be shown in their entirety during class time, so that instead of giving a lecture on the early sound period, we would just be told \"here is an early sound film\". Meanwhile, films that were important to the period, such as \"The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari\" and \"Birth of a Nation\" were largely ignored. Every x-hour was used, and in every x-hour we were shown a documentary videotape. These were often interesting, but why not just go to Jones Media Center and rent them? This is a class, the professor is supposed to teach it.\"",

Her lectures were boring and her exmas were somewhat unfair. They often asked you to understand the smallest, msot minute details about her lectures. That was really bad because i would study a lot beforehand and feel confident about my studying while going into the test, only to leave the test completely unsure about how i did. The movies themsleves were interesting.

But the films you see later in the term make it all worthwhile! You learn a lot of interesting facts, and Prof Williams certainly knows his silent film. His lecture style was off-putting at first, but once I got used to it, his mannerisms in class were enjoyable. Do the readings, though, and go to class, because the midterm and final are fair, but difficult. Details about the films are wanted, and how can you include those if you never came to class to see them?\"",
            "review 4: \"01F with Mark Williams: This class is a fun class if you have any interest at all in silent film. It is kind of boring the first few days, but as the films get longer, the class improves. Be aware that this class uses the x-hour on Mondays every week, so class is from 3-6PM. If you have schedule conflicts or don't think you can sit through class for that long a period (it's not all lecture...you watch some films as well), don't take this course. Also, Prof. Williams usually extends class to about 6 instead of ending at 5:50. The lectures are usually pretty well-organized. Prof. Williams is very intelligent; however, sometimes he assumes a little more knowledge of the subject on the part of the students than they actually have. He expects you to be able to analyze the films you see in class and discuss them, although most of the course is lecture rather than discussion. If you think you can discuss films at least a little, then you should take this class. There are a lot of reading assignments for this class, but I found that you don't necessarily have to read all of them until right before the exam, and even then you only need to read some of them. The exams (midterm/final) are difficult, but if you study for them, they're not a problem. There is one open topic 8-10 pg research paper due at the end of the term. You can choose any topic relating to silent film that interests you, so this is not a problem. If you have the time to devote to this class, it is definitely worth taking.\"",
            "review 5: \"01F with Mark Williams: I've talked to a few non-majors who took this class because it sounded interesting. Indeed, the material has the potential to be really interesting, and the actual screenings from the time period were quite good. However, Prof Williams chose to teach the class using a series of documentaries that on their own would have been quite good but, in the context of a class, slowed the tempo of that class and prevented us from seeing other films of the silent era. Prof Williams is a genuinely good lecturer and an intelligent guy, but he also likes to force discussions. Even after a film has run ten minutes past the time class is supposed to end (mind you, with a 3A, we're talking 6 PM by now), he insists on keeping the class behind to \"discuss,\" and when no one has anything to say he will threaten to make you do jumping jacks. This is not an empty threat. The screenings were good and the reading material was interesting, or at least informative, for the most part, but there were days when I dreaded going to class, only to be faced by the oppressive silence inherent in a class held in a movie theatre (it meets in Loew). Preparing for the exams does make you learn the material, though, and in terms of written work the class wasn't very hard. But be forewarned. It takes a fair amount of perseverence to make it through this class.\"",
            "review 6: \"01F with Mark Williams: I liked this course for the overall inspiration factor, but not really for the specific content. Silent films aren't really a hobby of mine, but some of the readings and lectures really struck a chord with me in relation to modernity, the role of new technologies, the changing scape of art, the effect of new media on societal trends, etc. Classes are three hours long. I can't stand it. The good news is you can grab fries at the hop if he's screening a film you don't care about.\""

The copious amounts of extra non-graded creative work that we did in and outside of class I found to be the most rewarding. It was nice to take a writing seminar that wasn't entirely focused on boring analytical writing, and actually challenged me to express myself through new mediums. The course could be better organized and less intense logistically; david could have been clearer and less wordy in exactly what our assignments were, as they were really pretty straight-forward. I might have preferred a little less of a focus on biopix films and even more focus on group activities and refreshing creative assignments. David, as we call him, is extremely approachable and enthusiastic about the students in his course, maybe even to the extent that it stresses him out a little. I appreciated the amount of energy he brought to the material, and how he ruthlessly tried to get us to come together as a group. He is also very critical of the writing and social behavior of his students, and is not afraid to express it- this is a good thing. David is a wonderful man, and a good person to know. David might have been a little less blatant when he would split up the class along gender, ethnic, and social lines during class discussions, but nonetheless I think that pushed our cohesiveness as a group.

David likes weird, off-tangent topics, so if you take this course, you'll probably find yourself sitting in front of the computer for hours and hours every other week just to think of an interesting thesis - a really, really good way to stretch your imagination and open yourself up to really bizarre, creative ideas. Moreover, we had to do many creative assignments that ranged from dancing to prose writing to film-making (depending on what your interests are). Even the so-called non-creative people in the class found a niche and did well, so don't worry at all if you're not the typical musician or writer. In fact, I think this course would be even more useful for the supposedly non-creative type - I thought I couldn't write fiction until I took this course.

You have 4 2.5 page papers, where you can basically write anything regarding 4 movies which we view and analyze for the class. Instead of writing one of the papers, you can substitute a screenplay in its place instead. The screenplay is awesome to be honest. If you put in the time and effort, there is no reason you can't get an A. Also, Professor Phillips talks about his amazing experiences as a driector/screenwriter in hollywood. There really aren't many \"true discussions, just Professor Phillips telling us about Hollywood. Honestly, this is probably my favorite course in my freshman year. Live it up!!!\"",

I can honestly say I learned more about sudoku in this class than I did about screen adaptations. Napping was also a favorite activity of everyone in class. We typically justwatched movies in class - the few times he attempted a discussion, no one actually talked/raised their hand, so it was a sad one-sided conversation. Papers were due about every two weeks and you submitted them to a writing assistant before you gave it to Phillips to be graded. It was really hit or miss - Phillips typically didn't care about the same things the WAs were stuck on, and the WAs could have good or bad weeks. Phillips gave little to no guidance on HOW to write or what to write about. The class could be taught by anyone just grabbed off the street. You should only take this class if you're INCREDIBLY interested in film and would like to get to know Phillips (he's really available for office hours). Or if you want a hardcore slacker class that requires minimal effort on occasional papers. Oh, and sparknote the books - the only reason to read is for quotes. Otherwise, RUN FAR FAR AWAY.\""

I'm not sure if the films were to everyone's taste, but if you're open-minded about more obscure movies, you'll enjoy the class. The reading list is great as well (though we very seldom discussed the readings in class). Prof. Harrell is very interesting and approachable. (Ask him to show you his own short animations!) He gives you a lot of creative freedom for your final oral presentations and your essays, but he will also provide you helpful guidance if you ask for it. This class, more than any other I've taken so far, really allows you to create your own workload and academic interests. Although it won't be required of you, I definitely recommend reading all of the books assigned; it'll give you such a clearer understanding of how the prof. has structured the course and the film selection.\""

Each week focused on a different aspect of filmmaking: cinematography, art direction, editing, etc. We had five quizzes, of which we had to take four - but these were really easy and had bonus questions at the end to make up for mistakes. We also had to write a journal entry about each film, which you could either bs through or spend a lot of time on.

The project at the end is cake - I'd recommend doing a \"creative project\" about the making of a movie rather than picking a specific profession to study - it's hard to do that much research on obscure movies.

If you've taken other film classes at the school before or if you feel like you already know a lot about film, you'll probably find the class to be far too basic and introductory.

I just needed to create a project explaining the pre-production, production, post-production, distribution, and reception of a film of my choice. I spent quite a deal of time on my project, only to be severely marked down for not discussing the art director and editor with enough detail.

As for the assessments, there are weekly quizzes and it\u2019s very hard to predict what will be on them, so there was a lot of stress that went into this class since no one really knew what was going on. Speaking of quizzes, there will often be content on it that is within a 40 page reading that is assigned on top of textbook chapter readings. As for the prof, he\u2019s a nice person, but he talks in a really soft voice and it\u2019s sometimes hard to hear/concentrate without falling asleep. On top of that, attendance is required every time because classes aren\u2019t recorded nor does he post slideshows of important notes for students to have a copy.

            "review 15: \"04F with Mark Williams: Considering its title, \"From Script to Screen,\" I thought this course would be about the filmmaking process-- some combination of technical and literary analysis. Film studies, I discovered, is more like a lit course than anything. Much of class time, therefore, was spent screening films and analyzing them according to standards described in the lectures. Homework involved readings about the films or about literary theory and studying for the six reading quizzes. There was a midterm, a final and a 2-3 page paper that included some sketches. The grading was easy, though sometimes the reading quizzes expected you to recall obscure information. The subject matter was interesting, and the class was fairly large but engaged. My main gripe: the lectures were conducted in sort of a free-wheeling manner. Professor Williams began with a concept, often wrote it on the board, and then asked a broad question that would elicit 20 minutes worth of student answers. As a result, it was hard to separate the stuff he actually wanted us to know and the crap that spewed from the students' mouths. I personally prefer to distinguish more sharply between lecture and discussion. A more controversial gripe: Professor Williams is obviously enamored with postmodernism and critical theory. This is fine and often interesting; however, we spent the vast, vast majority of class drawing distinctions between modernist/postmodernist elements in films with the classical films. Yet we never saw a prototypical classical film, which made such comparisons a little meaningless. The other thing about postmodernism... its jargon and long-windedness can take you far away from the source (the movie). When I studied for the final, I realized how I could have as easily been studying for a lit theory class as for a film class; there was little about the medium specifically. A little disappointing. That said, though, it's fun, easy and interesting.\"",

He'd respond to almost every question you asked with \"What do you think?\" and to every point you made with \"Perhaps,\" or \"Maybe.\" I didn't mind this generally, because it made you think about and defend your ideas, but it could be kind of frustrating when you just wanted something defined. There's a good amount of reading for this course, and you can't really read \"selectively\" if you want to do well on the quizzes--although you can postpone Monday's reading until the night before Thursday's quiz. The class average on most quizzes was something like 5 out of 10 (he counts the best 5 out of 6 quizzes), but it IS possible to do well if you read thoroughly. The movies are really interesting, but you have to be pretty open-minded to appreciate the more experimental ones. If you are genuinely interested in film, this is a great class.\"",

This class was everything i wanted in an introductory film class. Williams was a great lecturer most of the time, keeps the excitement going even when talking about something as bland as genre. The course profoundly changes the way you'll watch and process movies, and the discussion of each film that you screen is usually pretty mindblowing. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in often very artistic and philosophical discussion, you will probably lose interest halfway through the course. I enjoyed the balance and would reccomend this course highly.\"",

You can re-write papers usually if you get a C+ or below, but even then your grade might only improve by 1/2 a step (aka C+/B-).

Cinematography, mise-en-scene, editing, screenwriting, and sound are all covered, although only to the extent that you can analyze and talk about them intelligently. There's also a lot about behind-the-scenes jobs, like the producer, the key grip, the gaffer, the best boy, the script girl, etc. The level of depth is what you would expect out of a survey course. About the professor: Professor Lawrence gives fairly standard lectures, so they can get boring sometimes. She's very well-organized and definitely knows what she's talking about. However, the main reason I would recommend taking this class with her over some other professor is that she shows some very good, relatively unknown movies that you probably would not see otherwise. I can't guarantee that you'll like these movies, but personally I loved them. The quizzes that she gives are very easy if you take good notes in class. She grades the papers fairly hard though. Overall, it's on par with other survey classes I've taken in terms of difficulty.\"",

The only negative thing I have to say is that the tests and papers were graded a bit harshly - Professor Ruoff has specific answers in mind. If you don't answer according to his specific answers, you will definitely lose points. I felt he graded a bit too harshly. On the other hand, Ruoff is very knowledgeable about film and film history. He was always available for office hours. A lot of the class didn't take advantage of them, but they were very helpful.
