As this was a senior seminar, much of the class was supposed to be discussion. Yet he cut off every class early, would ask confusing questions and then point the blame on us for not wanting to discuss. Discussions would actually go better until he intervened, at which point he would say something that no one would understand or did not require a reply. His attitude eventually lead to no one wanting to talk. He was also short and curt in office hours, even if you visit once or twice with good questions. He also played clear favorites. He is a self-centered prof that is too impressed with himself to even care about students. In all my years here I have never had a prof that I thought should never teach again (and would probably be happier for it.) If you take a course with him, he will defintely not care about you unless to harass you about being absent and how this will negatively affect your grade. I normally have an excellent reletionship with profs and have had no problem getting numerous recommendations, but I could not wait to be done with Kang. The first few classes appeared to be fine, even inspired, but you quickly realize what he is really about. Just stay away\"",

I think mostly this is the fault of the AMES department for allowing all of its middle eastern professors to go on sabbatical concurrently. That being said, Kang was incredibly dismissive to my opinions and thoughts, even when he specifically asked my opinion. He is laid back and relaxed, almost trying a little too hard to be cool. But whether its genuine or not, i felt it was a bit unprofessional at times. He wasn't available out of class becuase he never really told us when his office hours are. I read the other review that is currently posted and it was pretty harsh. I tend to agree, but I would like to say that I'm sure Professor Kang would be fine for people who are 1) interested in international relations, 2) interested in East Asia, 3) not personally offended by his rude behavior, 4) have a background in economics. Becuase I am really none of these categories, I would say, if you are forced to take this class, as I was, it'll be alright, it just didn't culminate any experience I've had at Dartmouth. Professor Kang, for his credit, though, is very knowledgable about what he does and is probably inspiring to those whose interests align.\"",

            "review 2: \"17F with Clare Gillis: Prof. Gillis is an phenomenally interesting person. She has lived a good part of her life in the Middle East, reporting on the ground. She tells amazing stories. For example, she was captured on the front lines of the Libyan revolution by Qaddafi's soldiers, imprisoned for several months with Jim Foley, the journalist who was horrifically beheaded by ISIS in 2014. She received a copy of Animal Farm and a strange letter directly from Qaddafi himself, and she was one of the first journalists to report Qaddafi's death. Her class was intimate and open to discussion, and the articles she suggested helped me learn a lot. The subject material is really engrossing. She requires Canvas posts for most readings, which are a bit annoying (you have to do them the day before class), but make the discussion quite a bit better as they force you to analyze the reading. Even if you're not an AMES major, these issues are important to understanding the modern world, and few have as much of a powerful and realistic grasp of the Arab Spring as Clare. However, she is also very disorganized. We roughly followed the syllabus, but we did not receive it until the 3rd week of the term. She also cancelled one of our papers the day before it was due. The due date for the final paper wasn't clear, which actually hurt my grade slightly, although she was very flexible and gave extensions if you needed them. You have to be prepared for some uncertainty. Overall: a bit of a layup, just do the readings and write your papers on interesting topics. Make meaningful comments in class. Be prepared for disorganization. In some ways, you decide how much work you have to do; you can choose to do the readings you want. Professor Gillis is dope and highly recommended.

It seemed to be a course that no one was interested in-- not the professor and not the students-- and that no one was taking seriously-- again, neither the professor nor the students. It seemed to be crowded with seniors looking for an easy A who, the few times they appeared in class, did nothing (course related, though there was plenty of disruptive activity) and knew nothing. The ostensible requirements for the course were difficult to discover, as there was no syllabus ever given out. As the end of the course approached, assignments were suddenly introduced. One was to participate in a concert (this we did know about from the beginning) and to write about what we had learned from this experience. There were no guidelines given for this paper, and I shudder to think what some of my fellow 'participants' wrote judging from their preparation for and behavior during the 'concert'. We were also told, as the end of term approached, to write a paper on a book that we had never read or discussed and that was not in the bookstore. Again, no guidelines were offered for the writing of the paper. Since I had learned nothing about Indonesia during the course of the term and had known nothing about Indonesia before enrolling-- which was one reason I had signed up-- it was not easy for me to write the paper on an intensely dull book that demanded extensive knowledge of Indonesian culture and politics. However, none of this really mattered as we never received grades for our papers, comments on our papers or any indication that anyone had ever read our papers. I hope my classmates all got the grades they were hoping for. I assume that they did. I did not get what I was hoping for, which was some knowledge of a fascinating culture.

        "James Dorsey": [
            "review 1: \"08S with James Dorsey: As my first culture/history class at Dartmouth, this was a great intro. I was a bit dismayed to learn that I would need to take JAPN 10 in the spring in order to go on the LSA+ (which, along with Japanese [Language] 3 and freshman seminar, left no room for anything else), but in the end, the class was interesting, enjoyable, and a welcome respite from what, for me, would have necessarily been another math course. Let me preface my actual review by explaining one especially relevant point (in my mind anyway). It is likely that around 20 members of the class will be language students going on the LSA+, while the other 10-15 students are not. As a member of the former group it was a bit harder to see, but there was definitely somewhat of a split between these groups, at least in the sense that the language students all already knew each other, and most already knew Professor Dorsey. The language students were also able to pick up on some details of the lectures (involving kanji and Japanese words) that at least slightly enriched the experience. This is not to say that anybody ever looked explicitly uncomfortable, or that an understanding of the language was at all necessary. Anyway... The class covers Japanese history from pre-history (aka: when Japan was merely the geographic area presently known as Japan) until modern times, although due to time contraints, relatively little time is spent on modern culture/history. But the history doesn't seem to be the focus. Rather, it is the cultural and literary aspects of the different time periods that receive the most attention. There tended to be an article or two to read for every class (with about 4 full-length books spread out over the course) which ranged from classic poetry to feminist philosophy to modern manga. Needless to say, everyone I talked to admitted to shirking on the readings from time to time, which (being a goody-goody) shocked me. But honestly- they're the only real work for the class, and they are by no means presented in excess. Several movie screenings were also \"required,\" although these were hardly a burden as every movie was more than worthwhile (Princess Mononoke, Seven Samurai, Lost in Translation, etc.). The two short midterms (that focused on the literature) were more than fair. I admittedly studied very little, but aced them just as a result of coming to class and paying attention every day. The single group project was no big time-sink (just a narrated powerpoint on a topic not elaborated on in class), although it could become tricky if it were the case that no one in the group had any technical prowess. The final paper is a bit of a wild card, as it can be on any [relevant] topic you want, as long as you can relate it to key themes of the course with an actual thesis. I wrote mine on a modern day anime, for example (haven't received grades yet though- I might have failed terribly). I really have no complaints about Dorsey as a professor. His lectures were well-presented and interesting. He was always open to question and discussion-type comments during class, and was more than accessible outside of class. His knowledge and appreciation of the subject is clear, and keeps the class moving. In short: -Enjoyable, interesting material (in the form of frequent readings and movies) -Little real \"work\" -Two fair tests, one small project, one final paper In you have to take this for the LSA+, well then you have to take it... If you're going for an AMES minor, or just want to fulfill NWculture (or something), and have any sort of interest in Japan, this class is worthwhile. It's no big time committment, but you'll still learn a lot.\"",

Go to his office hour, talk to him about anything you think about the class or Japan and you will know how cool he is.\"",

The prof was really lenient on what things we could write about. The lectures were really interesting, especially with this prof, and I found the class discussions thought-provoking. The only not-really-cool thing was that the class was so large and the people who were taking Japanese and the people who weren't mostly self-segregated, but that doesn't really impinge on the quality of the class itself.\"",

Overall, it was really interesting - I've always been interested in Japan and this gave me a nice background in how it got to be where it is now. The course gets particularly interesting when it gets to early twentieth century Japan, Dorsey's specialty. Dorsey, good natured as he is, unfortunately seemed to stumble through lectures sometimes. He could use a bit of preparation; but I've definitely had worse professors (and a few better ones). Another complaint I have is one typical of the Asian courses I've taken thus far - the professor and the Asian-language speaking students develop a kinship and all laugh at subtle things that us native US-borns can't get - simple characters adorning the powerpoints that the prof doesn't bother translating. It's understandable, and I don't blame anyone for it - I just wish Dorsey would bother to translate everything. I think he sometimes forgets that not everyone can read/speak Japanese. Overall, my other major concern was that the majority of the course looked at Japanese literature through different lenses - two main ones being Marxism and feminism. Feminism - whatever, it just seemed a bit out of place, but Dorsey likes his gender theory. Marxism was just ridiculous. At times it was treated as if it hadn't been disproven by 70 years of Soviet history. But other than that, the course was enjoyable, and I would recommend it, particularly if you are taking it like I am for a NW.\"",

As a result, most of the class was devoted to literature and not enough to actual history; I don't think we even talked about the Han Dynasty. This would be a great class if it was more organized and focused on only Chinese culture with a few, well-selected excerpts of literature rather than anywhere from 40 to 100 pages of it every class. Most of the people in the class are going on the FSP; if you can, take a different Chinese culture class as it can serve in lieu (though for the major I think you need this class).

The prof really focuses on literature, and her lectures are mostly based around that. Keep in mind that her exams aren't solely focused around the literature -- she contributes a lot of her input and thought into the significance of the literature, and she WILL test you on that.

Unfortunately, he was unable to teach the course, so Prof. Sarah Allan, DAMELL (Chinese), took over. Professor Allan is a very accomplished professor and a great person, but this was not the right type of course for her to teach. The class was very large (50+ students showed up on a regular basis) and the format was lecture-based. Unfortunately, Prof. Allan is not a very good lecturer for students taking an intro Chinese culture course. The course is a prereq for the DAMELL (Chinese) major and the Beijing FSP, so I have a feeling that many people were taking it not because they were interested in the thousands of years of Chinese culture, but because they HAD to. Although she had very good insight into the topics covered, Professor Allan would be more appropriate for advanced students (or students who actually care about two thousand year old Chinese poems). I'm a freshmen DAMELL(Chinese)/AMES double major, and this was my first course with her. I hear from upperclassman that she's an excellent professor in a smaller, discussion-based seminar course. Hopefully next year she won't be teaching this course. My other main gripe with this course was the testing. There was a mid term and a final, and two quizzes. The quizzes were easy fill in the blank, short answer fact recalls, but the midterm and final were another story. Basically the test had unidentified excertpts from the hundreds of poems we read during the course, and we had to identify the author, title, and dynasty. It was ridiculous. The poems are really boring. They all revolve around imagery of mountains and trees and other wilderness images. THEY ALL WERE THE SAME!!! If you take this course, be preprared for a lot of boring readings that you'll need to be able to identify on tests!\"",

Prof. Kang kept joking about how we all must have been asleep that early in the morning because we were so quiet, but I never had trouble staying awake in this class. So, this is one of the classes where attendance is part of your grade. There's page-long weekly response papers; you can basically go off on whatever tangent you feel like as long as it's based on the readings.

If you want consistent check-pluses, synthesize your own unconventional--i.e., crazy--idea and back it up with details from the readings.)

We had to write two short papers, and we had a midterm and a take-home final of three 2-page essays.\"",
            "review 2: \"07W with Gil Raz: This is a good class, and not particularly hard to do well... as long as you go to class and do the readings. There is a good amount of reading but not overwhelming (around 20p for every class). Gil Raz is a really nice guy and an interesting lecturer. This class fulfills some nice distribs. You probably won't regret taking it.\"",
            "review 3: \"07W with Gil Raz: But i did learn a lot I wish the lectures were on a more interesting subject Class was very managable but almost nobody participated in discussions which made everything really boring. expect to be on blitz the entire class\"",
            "review 4: \"07W with Gil Raz: While the ORC description may lead you to think that this is an interesting course to take, I recommend you buy the books for this course at Wheelock and read them on your own time. The interest that I have in this subject could not overcome the enormous amount of frustration with having Raz as a prof. He doesn't enunciate or project in class, and his lectures are all over the place. The level of disorganization shows in that the titles of his lectures don't match with the syllabus. Often, the lecture slides do not help you understand the main points of the day because they are mostly copy/pasted text from the readings, pictures, and questions about the main ideas. If you do end up having to take this course, make sure you edit/label and date the lecture slides yourself and take very clear, careful notes of everything that comes out of his mouth. The professor is opinionated about the subject, and he's one of those profs who think that his course takes precedence over anything else in your life. (He will e-mail you extra readings at 10 PM of the day before.) The exams and paper assignments may seem unclear at first. This is because they test not your analytical skills but memory - specifically, your ability to memorization his opinions. Assignments from this prof generally read something like this: \"In class, I said _____. Do you agree? Please write about why you agree. And mention ___, ____, and ___.\"\"",

I feel that this course truly analyzes the mindset of the Chinese populace by way of its religion. So, for those who are looking for a Chinese 10 alternative, you should take this course instead!! This course has a somewhat straightforward midterm and two essays. The final consisted of three 2-3 page essays. I was shocked by how many essays we had to do, but the questions were relatively easy and fun to do!\"",

If I could do it over again, I would not take this class.\"",

The prof was really into the subject though and all the lectures were really interesting and well organized. It is essential that you attend every class! Also, take Intro to Christianity first, or have a good solid understanding of that religion before taking this!\"",
            "review 3: \"07W with A. Kevin: This was my first religion class at Dartmouth, and while it wasn't great, I'll probably end up taking some more. Reinhart is quite an interesting professor. He's extremely knowledgeable on the subject, and you get the sense that he really has been there and done that. He knows everything about this stuff. However, he's really arrogant and detached from the students. He calls us his \"peers,\" but with the way he responds to questions in class and to students' ideas, we're treated more like grade-school children. He's not receptive at all to students' ideas if they differ from his own, and sometimes scoffs at students' failed attempts to make sense of the material. I'm sure there are better religion professors to learn this stuff from. That said, the material is really interesting although a bit dry at times. I really feel like I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Islam... its early history, the different sources of scripture, the Sunni/Shia split, prayer and ritual, the 5 pillars, Sufism, and so on. The workload is weird: two take-home exams in the form of papers and a \"text study,\" which is the biggest part of the grade. We only spent one class talking about what a \"text study\" was, and so most of the papers, in Reinhart's opinion, weren't actually text studies... very frustrating. There are also two half-hour quizzes with IDs and short essays. \"half-hour\" really means 25 minutes for a quiz that needs an hour to be done well. very frustrating. Overall, certainly not the best Intro to Islam I could have imagined. It's a pretty passive straight lecture class with an arrogant professor and a lot of reading that's not really connected to the lectures. You could probably get by just skimming the readings for names and dates and then reading the pieces that the papers are based on.\"",
            "review 4: \"07W with A. Kevin: Prof. Reinhart is kind of a hard grader and is interpersonal skills are pisspoor on top of that. He's really into the material but presents one-sided views to everything.\"",

That said, his lectures were extremely interesting and helpful. He clearly knows a lot about this subject. If you pay attention and keep up with the reading, you will do fine. He wasn't as unapproachable in office hours as in class, oddly enough.\"",
            "review 6: \"07W with A. Kevin: While this wasn't the most painful class I definitely had a hard time being motivated to learn the material. The lectures were pretty boring, but in the end I learned a lot about the misconceptions of Islam embedded in western culture.\""

            "review 1: \"09X with Diana Abouali: This course should be cross listed in history. She gives many readings, most of them are not necessary. The final was an essay test in which we were given the questions ahead of time. Not too bad, easy class, most of the time too slow.\"",
            "review 2: \"09X with Diana Abouali: this is by far the worst class i've ever taken at dartmouth with the worst professor i've ever had here. let's go through some points: 1) she lectures from her notes on paper! i'm sorry, but i'm investing way too much money into my education for a 'professor' to lecture off of her notes. she has a tendency to forget what she is saying, look around awkwardly, and then look at her notes to try to pick up from where she left off. 2) the tests are arbitrarily graded! if you're a non-major and know little about arabic culture/history, i don't suggest taking this course. she expects you to synthesize thousands of years of information when many non-majors are focused on putting the historical pieces together. perhaps if she organized her lectures effectively, the majority of students would not feel lost as to what was going on between certain time periods. she gives the questions out before the exam, but it's still unreasonable to expect students with no background in the subject to make sense of the material if she is an ineffective lecturer. 3) she didn't grade our exams until AFTER the drop deadline! i think that speaks to her commitment to teaching. don't you think? 4) she is a HARD grader! yes, she is a hard grader. what is a hard grader? a hard grader is someone who is EXTREMELY picky with the foreign words you use (um, i didn't take arabic.. sorry), or the terms you present. i've had professors in other courses who are supposedly hard graders, but at least they are fair... if you work hard and write well, you will get an A-. i'm sorry, that's not the case with this professor. 5) she went over time in class frequently. 6) she assigns an unreasonable amount of reading for her class, many of which are entirely unnecessary. okay, i've heard many readings for other classes... but at least they're relevant to helping me understand the material. this reading, on the other hand, was pretty useless - neither the readers nor her lectures established the concepts we needed to remember. 7) non-majors and people with no knowledge of the subject are at a severe disadvantage. she seems to favor those students who do have a background in the class, since they're just building on old material. you, mr/mrs non major who only needs a distrib, are screwed searching the internet for a way to make sense of it all. so my point is don't take this course if you want an easy A/A-. if you're at dartmouth simply to 'learn' or something intellectual like that, i don't suggest taking it either - you won't get much from it. NRO it. you'll realize you've made the right choice after her first lecture... good luck!!!\"",
            "review 3: \"09X with Diana Abouali: Trust me. This class is alright. I took this class randomly as a non-major, and I had no problems. As long as you show up to class and take good notes, you should be fine. The workload wasn't bad at all, and I got away without doing some of the assigned readings. Professor Abouali was extremely nice and very helpful. I thought her lectures were fine. She highlighted all the important points you needed to know. I visited her during office hours before the midterm and the final to make sure I knew what she wanted in my essays. She gave me straightforward advice and helped me answer the questions I had problems with. The midterm was short answer ID and an essay, and the final was all essay. The person that wrote the long review needs to chill. I took this class expecting it to be fairly easy and interesting, and the class turned out to be exactly what I thought it was going to be.\"",

Diana was really bad about getting our papers back to us, but she didn't expect the class to be as big as it was. She's an easy grader, and just wants people to learn more about the Middle East. If you don't know much about the Middle East, THIS IS THE CLASS TO TAKE. It's easy, interesting, and will broaden your global perspective x20million.\""
