The professor is one of the coolest guys I've ever met. Super nice, always available for help, he's one of those rare profs who genuinely cares about what he's teaching. He doesn't have a \"goal median\", he isn't trying to shove his worldview down your throat. His only goal is to make you think a little deeper about the world around you. Really, really cool guy! I highly recommend taking at least one class with him. Also, our graded assignments were as follows: - 2 discussion posts - Group creative writing piece - Social critique paper (4-5 pages) - Final essay (6-9 pages) - Creative project He only counted the highest grade from either the social critiqute or the final essay.

But he grades that way because you can hand in as many drafts of an assignment as you want before finals. Although this was a good opportunity, in reality there wasn't much time to make a lot of other drafts because pretty much each week was a new assignment.

She was always available to talk and to give detailed, helpful feedback on papers. There was no pointless busy work in this class. Everything felt interesting and meaningful. However, this is not really a layup class. I don't think any of the English senior seminars are particularly layups, because they are all small classes full of English majors and you really cannot get away with not doing the readings. On a busy week, you may be able to get away with skimming/doing Sparknotes, but it just isn\u2019t ideal. Thankfully, I found the readings to be manageable and fun. We read things like Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d, Achebe\u2019s \u201cNo Longer At Ease\u201d, and Salih\u2019s \u201cSeason of Migration to the North\u201d. You pretty much read one novel per week, and the novel will be split into manageable sections for each class. The main assignments of the class were: a short comparative paper, a take-home midterm paper, and an in-class final paper. There were also a few discussion posts. This class was interesting, meaningful, and manageable. I am really glad I took this class and met Prof. Tanoukhi. I would definitely recommend this class.\""

I certainly didn't have much background, and I felt like most of my classmates had a much better grasp of the course material and engaged with the class a lot more than I did. I generally enjoyed this class and I found the material usually very interesting, but I found Professor McCann extremely frustrating at times. The course material is very dense, and oftentimes, the connections between different readings/movies/etc. is tenuous and unclear, and Prof. McCann doesn't take much time to clarify the framework through which he wants you to understand it. Very little time is spent making sure that everyone was on the same page. It was mostly lecture, but in kind of the worst way possible? I don't mind lecture-based classes, but Prof. McCann mostly lectures (or really just rants) at the class for a majority of time, and then is confused when we don't all have very intelligent things to say in response. I know this is a higher-level English class, but as an English major, none of the other higher-level English classes I have taken have been so oddly dense and unorganized. Prof. McCann didn't seem overly concerned with whether or not students took anything away from this class, and more so was interested in solidifying his own thoughts surrounding this very niche realm of critical theory. As the head of the department, I expected a lot better from McCann. If you're really into late nineteenth century and early twentieth century material, then maybe you'll really like this class, but I wouldn't generally recommend this class unless it fills a very niche interest of yours.\"",

Prof McCann is very smart and a great lecturer, though he can sometimes be confusing on what he wants from the class during discussion & in assignment descriptions. He has a few grammar things that really bother him in essays (mainly passive voice), but if you keep your grammar very precise he's a fair grader. Extremely available in office hours - probably the most of any prof I've had. The readings and films were all super cool - McCann doesn't micromanage on people doing readings or turning things in on time, but the readings are interesting enough that I didn't have any issue getting the readings done for class most of the time. Would recommend this class to someone who already has some background knowledge on the topic or has a big interest in late Victorian literature and/or Weimar cinema.\"",

He is very supportive and willing to discuss your projects at length! He may seem intimidating at first, but he is a fair grader. He hates passive voice in essays though. Avoid that, and you should do fine. Honestly, I found the class super interesting although media theory isn't really my thing.\""

He would tell us to have a certain novel read by a certain day in class, and then when that day came he would ask how many people had read it, only a handful would raise their hands and he would not lecture on/discuss it since he wanted to \"avoid spoilers\" for the novels. These novels have been out for 30-40 years and I'm sure people would actually read them if he enforced the timeline he creates but no, you read an entire novel in the course of five days and then get told you didn't have to (this happened every single time a novel was introduced, so eventually I learned, but still). We also didn't complete the syllabus laid out, we completely skipped Tar Baby and The Source of Our Self-Regard despite spending plenty of time repeating the same few buzzwords the prof liked to hear. I stg if I hear about how Morrison is \"interested in a historical maturity and moral adulthood\" one more time. The work outside of readings was minimal. There was a midterm made of 3, 2-3 page papers that was graded incredibly loosely, and a final \"research\" paper of 8-10 pages. I say \"research\" in quotes since we were only required to cite three sources. Is this class a Layup? Yes, the prof essentially said day one that if you participated in class, and wrote the midterm and final, you would get an A. Is it what I was hoping for out of a Junior Colloquium? No. It was painfully easy, and a victim of what I dub the 80/20 rule (80% of things being said in discussion are made by 20% of the people in class).

Only 2 A papers in the whole class. Brutal. But I highly recommend. Very enjoyable 10a. If ur willing to really try on a couple essays and read a couple of books, then you will do well. Even if not, you can get a B+ pretty easy and just really enjoy the material. Loved it. Evens is a great guy.\""

            "review 1: \"07F with Peter Travis: I really enjoyed my FSP experience. You have a lot more free time, do a lot more complete readings, and lectures are considerably more concise than those at Dartmouth (in my experience). This is the basic structure for classes (you take 3): -Optional 1-hour lectures 2-3 times a week by rotating staff. This may be on material you are reading or simply related material in the same period (i.e. you may attend a lecture on Eliot's Silas Mariner though you are only reading Middlemarch). These lectures can be quite large, up to 100 students in the English department. -One mandatory 1-hour seminar each week. These are small groups of about ten students. Each week a student presents on the text followed by discussion. -Dartmouth students must submit 2 2000-word essays for each class over the course of the term. Topics are entirely up to you in the honors courses. U of Glasgow students only have to turn in one essay, but they also have to take exams, which Dartmouth students are exempt from. -1 ten-minute presentation. Easily done; find a good critical essay and present it. Handouts are major bonus points with seminar conductors. For the honors courses, grading breaks down as follows: Essay # 1 - 45% Essay #2 - 45% Presentation - 5% Participation - 3% Attendance - 2% Dartmouth students are required to take 2 honors courses (you can choose between Victorian, American, Renaissance, and Augustan/Reformation Lit) and one third course related either to English literature or Scottish culture. I took an introductory Scottish literature course for my third class, and highly recommend it! The art courses at the city art school were also really popular. Definitely consider going on the Glasgow FSP... I read so much more in my English literature classes here than I have previously at Dartmouth. That being said, you don't go nearly as in depth in the material, but by the time you are a junior (presumably) and on the FSP you shouldn't need anyone to hold your hand through critical material. I had plenty of time to get all of my classwork done and travel a good part of Europe. Apply!\"",

Professor Maslen was my seminar leader, and an awesome prof. He was super enthusiastic during discussions. You were required to present for one class, chosen in the first class. He wanted you to introduce a question that would spark discussion on the reading for that week. Discussions were always interesting and he led them well. We read a mixture--not everything was part of the generally read canon. It was a good combination.\""

Huntington is a very sharp woman, and I think it would have been great if she shared some more of her intellect and thoughts on writing poetry with us. More writing exercises would have been a boon. The final project, on a poet, was interesting--Huntington did ask some probing questions, which required more familiarity with the poet and the poet's writing than a typical paper would. We only have a final portfolio and the final poet project--a midterm is optional. I think that a mandatory midterm, as well as upping the 1 poem required a week to two would have made me enjoy this class much more. Still, if you are interested in poetry and go to office hours, Huntington can help direct you to some very good poets. Although Mathis is my favorite poetry professor, I'm very glad that I had a class with Huntington as well. She's a nice woman, whose workshop technique (allowing the poet to ask questions to guide the critique) leads to a very positive workshop atmosphere. I suppose if you are applying to grad school and are busy with other things Fall term of your senior year, this class is the perfect workload as well.\"",

Her own poetry is interesting but she's definitely a little nutty. Her requirements were unclear and I ended up feeling frustrated often.

The grade is supposed to be composed of workshop participation, the final manuscript of 35-45 pages, discussion of the readings, and short writing assignments, but we never did any of the last two. The entire class was spent workshopping, so doing the readings was entirely useless, especially since they mostly go against the grain of what we were learning in class (the prof seemed to be trying to standardize how we wrote, which didn't sit well with me), so they only served to cause confusion. The only useful readings that we were assigned were chapters from our how-to-write-fiction books, but I STILL don't have a good idea of what we were supposed to take away from this class. We each turned in 3 workshop submissions, and for every submission from someone else, we had to write a page-long critique, which took ridiculous amounts of time away from the time I had to do my own writing. (Incidentally, the prof seemed to expect us to write 2-3 hours a day. I'm not sure how that's possible for college students with a full course-load and jobs and activities, etc.) We ended up using almost every x-hour, so we'd be trying to workshop 3-4 stories in a 3-hour period and 2-3 stories in a 2-hour period, every week. It was such a huge time-suck. At first, we just went around the room in speaking, but that didn't work so well because all of us talked too long about inconsequential things, so not only was it incredibly deadening, but also made us fall behind. It worked better when we started using a timer and allowing people to raise their hands and jump in. This class made me wish that I had been one of the majors/minors to turn in their applications late and get put in this memoir-writing class that the dept added due to the excess of students. This class increasingly made me want to drop it, to drop my minor entirely, and to not read because I now end up trying to pick a story apart instead of enjoying it. It was the single most negative thing in my life that term, and I would tell anyone considering taking this class with this prof to take it at their own risk. Of course, different people can have different experiences with the same professor. This was just mine.\""

Cleopatra Mathis is a really wonderful lady, and she does a good job as a professor, although I've had better at Dartmouth. She definitely is most amazing because of her life and what she stands for and the work she does...her teaching skills are solid but that is not her greatest strength. I definitely recommend taking a class with her at some pointn to get to know such a strong, inspiring person, and it is clear she has a heart for her students, but she is quite busy and over-extended, and her teaching suffers a little because of it. I felt like she could have been better prepared for class. And I felt like she could have given better guidance on technical aspects of writing poetry...like she could have done better to help students to develop a specfic language to talk about poetry. Also, we had to write two poems a week, which I thought was too much, (double what we could reasonably do), and workshop was very long and a little tough to get through. BUT Professor Mathis really encouraged us to develop our own voices, and she helped me feel a lot more confident about writing poetry. In addition, I feel like I grew a lot as a result of this class, although I felt like I was on my own a lot of the time, which I suppose that is how the real world of writing is, but it would have been nice to have some more support jumping into things. This class is definitely a \"you get out of it what you put into it\" kind of deal. Which is tough during sophomore summer at least. But Professor Mathis is a warm, compassionate, genuine person and a strong voice in poetry, and I at least recommend knowing her as a person, regardless of whether or not you end up taking a class with her.\"",

If you are self-motivated and will read many poems a day, update your reading log and writing journal constantly, write the poetry reading responses and poem reviews you are supposed to, then you will get a lot out of the course. Professor Mathis has an open-minded view about poetry and is careful not to push students into writing the kind of poetry she personally likes. Instead, she encourages all different forms of poetry. In judging the poetry, she focuses on whether or not it accomplishes what it sets out to do. She does expect you to write poetry for other people (that is, other people can understand it)--not just write poetry for yourself (that is, poetry that only you can personally understand and is limp to non-personal readers). Professor Mathis has a class project: final manuscripts. You must organize a final manuscript throughout the term that includes all your poetry, drafts, reviews, reading responses, and reading log. Much of your grade depends on this. Your grade also depends on your class participation. Problems: Sometimes your classmates might slack off and not give you an in-depth, honest poem critique. If you complain to the class, however, this will be fixed. Remember: for this course, you must have self-motivation. If you are one of those who only work when you are made to work, don't waste time taking this course.\""

Most of what we learned was from questions we asked him during workshopping. How workshopping works is this: every class, a few people each bring in a piece of poetry or prose (depending on which unit you're on) that they've written. They read it out loud, everybody has a few minutes of silence to write comments on the copy in front of them and/or compose their thoughts, and then for 10-15 minutes, the other students share what they liked, didn't like, suggestions, thoughts, interpretations, etc. Then the prof offers his thoughts, and finally the author has the chance to explain/clarify the piece and what they were trying to get at.

We read four Austen novels: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Persuasion. For each one, we would discuss the novel and some critical articles for three days and then in groups would give presentations on the \"afterlives,\" or modern adaptations, including film, fan fictions, literary criticism, and other media (tiktoks, tweets, book covers, etc.). After the presentation days we would have a short (2-3 page) reflection paper on what we individually learned- grades were based on these papers. We then had a final paper or creative project (not sure if Dever will repeat the project aspect). Overall, while I put in a lot of hours reading the novels, it was not too much of a burden and the papers did not take that much time. Beyond that, I totally enjoyed the class itself: we had a great in-class community and the discussions were interesting and engaging.

One day he gave us a short \"lecture\" and then said \"I'm not going to say anything more because I want you to contribute\" which, quite obviously to me, was a cop-out since he actually had nothing to say. Here's a nugget of wisdom from one lecture: \"storytelling through memory is truth-telling as history.\" What? Absolutely worthless. In fact, I specifically wrote this sentence down so I could laugh about it on the phone with my Mom (also an English prof) afterward. Now, it's true, Santa Ana is a nice guy and I feel bad sharing how much he sucks with all ya'll. But I don't want anyone else to be duped into wasting time with him. He sucks at grading; I definitely wrote better papers than he graded and yes, he took forever to get them back. Work was reasonable though. I was excited about the reading list but I was actually disappointed by some of the books. Still, I'm glad I read them because I feel they're a good representation of key texts in different minority lit groups (Native American, Chinese American, lesbian--althogh I did like that one, etc). Basically, it's a good thing I generally like the reading or else this class would've been a total dud.\"",

After the first few classes, he just didn't have anything new to say about post-modernism; it felt like he took the same 3 or 4 principles and then applied them to every single piece we read, expounding them until you want to rip up the books you've so carefully highlighted.\"",

This is the only reason it made me feel bad to write an awful review to the English department before I could access my grades on bannerstudent. My review (which I wish I had saved to post here) was the product of all the latent anger I had pent up over the course of his class. I feel like most of the points have been touched on by the other two '08 reviews here, except one: the class discussions. They were the most painful thing I've ever had to sit through. Basically the class was constructed that he would \"lecture\" (theoretically, often not in reality) for the first half and then we would have \"two student questions\" in the second half. Most of the underclassmen in the class (a sad majority) had no clue what they were talking about - which is fine. The English Department sets up its courses so senior majors take classes by freshman, so this can be expected. It's the professor's duty to lead these discussions and re-direct the conversation in a positive, enlightening direction and to stop students who are clearly just sounding off on some random tangent. Unfortunately, most times Santa Ana would call on the incoherent, rambling students who consistently made positive contributions and do nothing to control the situation. All in all, I felt like I wasted a lot of time and money on this class. The reading list was good, but I would have done just as well reading them on my own outside of this terrible class.\""

Basically what it comes down to is that I didn't understand anything that was going on in this class. Maybe it's because I'm dumb and I don't understand English. Or maybe it's because the teacher failed to actually teach me. (It's probably a little bit of both.) Pease lectures in the most ridiculous way, like he's trying to be as dramatic as possible. Yeah, he's a passionate performer, and he obviously knows way more about this stuff than I ever will. He's also a really nice guy, especially during office hours. But let's be honest: he's not an effective teacher. In my opinion, a great professor should be able to cut through all the fluff and garbage and just get right to the point of a topic. But Pease layers on so much extra fluff that it's impossible to figure out what he's saying. It's like he wants to demonstrate how great of a lecturer he is and how much he knows by using all these fancy words and using ridiculously complicated sentence structure. Meanwhile his students are frantically trying to type his words verbatim because there's no logical structure to what he's saying, you we have to write everything otherwise you'll never get any organized notes down at all. It would be helpful if he gave us some sort of outline or something beforehand that at least gave us a clue about what he was going to talk about during that day's class. But alas, there is no such lifeboat in this sea of incomprehensible words (see I told you I'm bad at English). To be fair, the reading was usually interesting, although it went way too quickly. A play a day is just too much to wrap your head around (at least it was for me.) Then for the tests he'd ask you these IDs that were on the most obscure details of the play, and of course I did poorly on them because I was too busy trying to get the main ideas of the plays instead of focusing on ridiculous details. But whatever. Maybe I should have read the plays 3 times each.\"",

Just do it before 8pm or whenever the office closes, because they are locked away. I think I have a different opinion than most when it comes to Pease. For instance, Im not a fan of his lectures and think a lot of what he says is a bunch of hot air, but apparently some people find them to be very inspiring? He might be a good speaker in that radio personality kind of way, but it was hard to figure out what exactly it was he was trying to say with all thr round-and-round language and invented words. I realized after the first class that I needed to bring my laptop to class so I could get some of his quick speech down. I would type everything he said word for word, and look at some of it and think to myself, that doesnt even make sense. He seems more interested in making the words flow in some kind of lyrical way than in actually making his point clear. I think a lot of the people who were impressed by him were kids who were taking the class for a LIT becuase they had heard it was easy and had never seen a real English prof give a lecture before. That said, the tests were very fair (if not very easy--he gives you the qustions and a couple Identification freebies before hand, so go to the class thats before the midterm/exam), he was a very understanding and very accomodating prof outside of class. He definitely understands schedules can get overwhelming sometimes, and he will do whatever he can to help you out-- so just go to him. After the papers were turned in he said something about due dates just being \"suggested\" and that there is no penalty for them, so if you are stressed, dont worry about getting the paper in. As for the plays, more are good than bad, and drama is easy to read. If it only takes 2-3 hours to watch a play, reading one definitely takes less time than that.

That being said, this course was large for an English class and filled with many non-majors. The result was that discussion did not reach the level of deep critical analysis from which the texts would have benefited. In addition, there were two exams which basically served as reading checks, annoying if you are used to taking English classes. Not to mention that you are bound to get some annoying sophomore in the class who feels the need to repeat everything the professor has said and bring interject commentary on obscure texts she has read just to show off her presumed intelligence to the professor.

It's hard sometimes, because of this, to seize on the really vital points. He's pretty theatrical and can be funny, also. Aside from the reading, this class was undemanding.

He is narrow-minded, pedantic, and dull, and his lectures are only interesting in that it can vaguely amusing to count how many words he makes up in an hour and five minutes. He has nothing of substance to say. Pease should consider teaching middle school gym; he does not belong at an Ivy-League Institution. He is very good at noting who came to class out of 60 some students, but he does not care to help develop the quality of students' individual minds. His greatest joy would be if everyone walked out of his class conforming to his slow-minded and inept analyses of the routine American Lit texts. I don't think Pease has actually thought about literature in a fresh way since he wrote his PhD dissertation years and years and years ago, and even then, I'm skeptical. He just spouts out these routine lectures that, I am quite convinced, he culled from the crypt of out-moded literary analysis and which are the same year after year. For the one measily paper we had to write for the class, he called each student into his office beforehand so that he could re-write their ideas to conform to his narrow interpretations of the text. If you do not agree with his interpretations of the text, he will tell you that your approach to reading the text is simply not valid. He does not encourage individual thought or personal growth, so if you are an intelligent, open-minded person, you will feel like you are being suffocated. If you like to be spoon-fed easy, mediocre answers because you are too dumb to think for yourself and you are only at Dartmouth because you are a 14th generation, monied WASP, this is the class for you!!! Further, the \"discussions\" in this class are a joke. How do you hold an effective discussion with 60 students when all you really want to do is make everyone regurgitate the bullshit you already said in class? The exams are easy and worthless. You get the essay questions beforehand, which count for about 90% of the exam grade, and the other 10% is how much minutiae from the texts you can recall under time pressure. Further, his level of professionalism leaves something to be desired. I was waiting outside of his office for quite a while to talk with him, and not only did he not stick to the schedule he established with me, but while I was waiting, I heard him scream, (no joke) many variations of the word \"fuck\" into the telephone and then slam it down on the reciever. He is not an okay person, and it interferes with his ability to be an effective academic resource. He is a waste of time, money, and space. It seems criminal to me that he gets paid for teaching at Dartmouth when there are vast numbers of qualified people at other institutions who would happily take his job and do it infinitely better than him.\"",

Additionally, some of the reading in this course are EXCELLENT. That being said, here's the bad stuff: Renza's lectures are utterly incomprehensible. When he discusses the texts in the context of the author's life, he CAN BE insightful and thought-provoking. However, he normally skims over that to move on to the text itself, at which point he wanders off in search of phallic puns and strange self-referential games the author seems to be playing on the reader and society in general. Unfortunately, James Fenimore Cooper was not a postmodern self-referential cynic, and Renza's pet theories are bull. And speaking of Cooper and bull, 75% of the reading in this course is absolutely terrible, and you have probably read the rest in high school (e.g. Huck Finn). Instead of taking on Moby Dick, Renza zips through Melville with Bartleby, Billy Budd and an obscure slave-ship story; then he wastes two weeks of time wandering through four obscure and tedious Henry James novellas. Worst of all, he burdens you down with historically popular but highly dated tripe like Last of the Mohicans and Uncle Tom's Cabin -- and then fails to place the works in the historical context that makes them at ALL worth reading in the first place.

He's all over the place and really excited, which keeps you awake, but makes the lectures seem drawn out. He has trouble making a point with efficiency. That said, the class grants you a lot of wiggle room in terms of workload. There's a midterm, an 8 page paper, and a final. That's it.

If you're interested in the reading list, then this is a fairly easy and not too painful course, but if you have no passion for Franklin, Emerson, Thoreau, Twain, Miller, Hurston, Kerouac, etc...then you'll probably suffer through the class and struggle to keep up with the reading. The final covered six novels and asked us to identify 15 fairly obscure quotes from the texts.

He also never revealed the breakdown of our grade. We had two quizzes, a takehome midterm of three short essays, and an 8-page final paper. The quiz questions often seemed over-specific, and his grading of the midterm was (in my opinion) a little harsh, because it demanded we use as a framework his interpretation of the poems.

My major problem with the class was that the only poets we looked at after 1900 were Frost and Milay - but I think the reason Cook got behind schedule in the term I took his class was that he was having family troubles, so failing to complete the syllabus is probably not something Cook does regularly. Another problem I had with the class were Cook's lectures. He can be very insightful when talking about poetry, but sometimes we would only spend twenty minutes out of our two hour class talking about poetry. His digressions were lengthy, irrelevant, and painful. I don't understand American poetry much better after having taken English 40 and regret having taking a class with Cook.\"",

And the class seemed very disorganized--there didn't seem to be any theme or order to the rambling, albeit entertaining, lectures. We would jump from poets we had read three weeks ago to poets we hadn't even read yet, instead of talking about what we had just read the night before.

Professor Schweitzer was always available to us, setting up meetings for our four papers, and our TA was also always ready to go over our work. All one has to do in order to get a good grade is to write a short review/explanation of the assigned reading before every class, and to complete the four assigned essays (three are 5 pages, one is 10 pages.) My only warning: I took this as a freshman before taking Writing 5. I suspect that I still will have a good grade, but I would advise that you complete Writing 5 before trying to keep up with the essays (Professor Schweitzer can be a really tough grader, especially if you haven't had the background in writing college essays that you really need.)\"",

Professor Schweitzer tried a little too hard to include a diverse selection of texts, and as a result, I think we missed some essential stuff (we entirely ignored Jonathan Edwards and barely touched on Jefferson and Franklin, for instance). The course seemed a little choppy, and I wasn't entirely sure what we were supposed to get out of it as a whole. I was a little confused about why some of the texts were even on the syllabus, especially a contemporary children's book. Professor Schweitzer's lectures were interesting, though not terribly well organized. Almost every class began with a student presentation about the contexts of what we had read. While these were certainly helpful, we spent so much class time on them that we rarely had time to look at the actual texts carefully. Professor Schweitzer made a great effort to take advantage of the resources here, and I really loved that she included a tour of the Orozco murals and a research activity in Rauner. Her grading was rather unclear. The feedback she gave on papers was often very specific and critical, and didn't give me an idea of how to improve my writing in general. She never told us how she would calculate our grades for the class (how much each paper was worth, how she graded re-writes, how much class participation was a factor, etc.) She was sometimes difficult to talk to about paper ideas, and on several occasions listened to my idea and then referred me to a book or article she or a friend had written on a completely different topic. Her availability for office hours was sporadic, and she even declined to meet with me to discuss my final paper because she had \"too much work\" to do. Unfortunately, problems like this outweighed the fun of some of the better readings we did in class.\"",

She attempts to look at the literature from all the Americas from the pre-Columbus period to the end of the 18th century. Only problem is, there is no way to fit all that material in the course so there's no sense of cohesion in the material. Although the course begins w/ material from Spanish, French, and British colonies, it drops the diverse approach, ending w/ writers of New England and the Middle Atalantic colonies. The Prof's grading is still a mystery to me. I have no idea how she graded papers and my grades changed from relatviely low (B/B-) to high (A/A-) w/o me making any changes to my writing style.\"",

We watched a lot of interesting movies in class like Disney's \"Pocahontas,\" and \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" We also had a tour of the Orozco murals in the Reserves room in the library and related it to the class and what we were reading.

However, she's also very informative about the time period and usually begins class with a great, but short, lecture. She's not always free at times outside office hours, but the office hours aren't terribly difficult to make. The only work for the course is three papers, which are actually great assignments because you get to choose your own topic. The only problem is that often, you're crunched for time because the material you write on is finished only a few days before the papers due date. Overall, great course. I'd highly recommend it.\"",

This class is discussion based; but Gerzina would allow students to give presentations as well. You write a lot in this class (Yippee!). What's great about Gerzina is takes note of the effort you put into the class. Your initial grades in the course may not reflect your final grade in the long run - as long as you take the time to revise and improve where she suggests you improve.\"",

We read two novels (Elizabeth Gaskell's \"Cranford\" and Eliot's The Mill on the Floss) as well as some nonfiction and poetry--Marx, Pater, Hopkins, Wilde, Beeton, the Rossettis...and then there's Michael Field. (Take the class if only to find out his secret!) Usually, Thomas lectured at the start of class, and then we discussed as a class or split up into groups of three to do close readings. She assigned three papers, which got progressively longer, and gave loads feedback to everybody. Sometimes the amount of reading got a little overwhelming--and it was on those days that discussion dragged. But otherwise, the class had some really interesting discussions. She was especially considerate during the time we had to write our final paper--the readings, short stories by Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle, were not too dense and were fun to read. Thomas is dynamic, funny, and caring. I'd take any class she teaches!\"",
            "review 2: \"02S with Katie-Louise Thomas: Speaking in retrospect from my four years at Dartmouth, I can honestly say that Professor Thomas was the absolute worst professor that I have ever been unfortunate enough to take a class with. I remember the details of the course like it was yesterday -- the professor had clear favorites in class, and would selectively call on her favored students and pretend not to see the hands raised by students with varying views and perspectives from her. She used the course as a means of furthering her own agenda, and is a radical feminist soley interested in propagating her own viewpoints through the class. While I have many friends who call themselves feminists, and whom I disagree with on many issues, I had a problem with a professor who was intolerant and close-minded about different perspectives on a given literary work. Differing opinions and beliefs are fine as long as they do not interfere with free intellectual discourse and discussion, but an absolute refusal to even consider or acknowledge varying views is extremely frustrating in what is supposed to be a discussion-based course. I was furthermore appalled when my grade in the course dropped from the highest grade in the class on the first paper to an unexpectedly and unexplained dismal grade on the final paper (there were only two papers in the class) because I chose to write my paper from a non-feminist perspective. I strongly believe that in an educational institution, a student's grade should not be determined by the degree of conformity to a professor's viewpoint, and I was extremely frustrated and disappointed with this professor. I loved, and still love, Victorian literature, and only a professor as awful as Professor Thomas could have so effectively ruined the course and the texts for me. Class itself was boring, and the discussion-based course often turned into lecturing because only those students who agreed with the professor's views participated as the weeks progressed. Though some of the readings were very interesting Victorian novels, others were random and uninteresting works that served no relevance than to promote the prof's feminist agenda. I had initially been excited about the freedom the open topic for the final paper allowed, but found out when it was too late that the \"free topic\" actually meant \"a free topic on any feminist perspective that the professor would agree with.\" I have never had such a disappointing academic and intellectual experience at Dartmouth, and this course influenced my decision NOT to major in English.\""

If you love drama, take it - plain and simple. But most people take the class as a lay-up, and it's really not even worth the minimal time you put into it. Prof. Pease is super smart and very passionate... but it won't resonate at all if you don't even know what he's talking about because you didn't read the plays because you don't care because you took the class as an easy A. In my opinion, not worth it (unless you like modern american drama lol!).\"",
            "review 2: \"23S with Donald Pease: A fine layup if you are a decent writer and know how to study texts. Lectures are really boring and random attendance taking was pretty annoying but they make it easy for you to do well in.\"",
            "review 3: \"22S with Donald Pease: I'm not fully convinced that this was a layup. Yea, its easier than some other dart/english classes in general, but there is still work. We read 3 plays a week depending on if we have another essay due, and they're long plays (I'd highly recommend LitCharts). While not totally necessary to read, we were supposed to have a match-quote-to-play test, but didn't end up having it. You should at least know all the characters, some themes, and the general plotline. Take notes in class! itll help with the midterm and final. The midterm and final (along with a 5-7 page paper) are not necessarily difficult but annoying to write because the prompts are pretty confusing and not always explained. All in all- not totally a layup, but easier than some classes.\"",
            "review 4: \"21S with Donald Pease: This class is definitely a layup. Starting after the midterm, I didn't read or watch any of the plays and still did totally fine. There are occasional discussion posts, a midterm, final, and 5-7 page paper on any topic you want to write about. The midterm and final were kinda annoying because the essay prompts were pretty vague and asked us to define terms we hadn't really solidified in class and write about many plays and how they related to the themes. They were also super long - my midterm was 2000 words and we were supposed to have written that in one class period, and from his review it seemed that that much writing was his expectation. Also, even though Pease is a gem and just the kindest man, the lectures were very dry and hard to stay engaged with. All in all, it's a layup, but not a very interesting one and the midterm and final are annoying.\"",
            "review 5: \"21S with Donald Pease: Great layup requiring minimal effort. The only real work is to watch/read the plays, and I recommend you do so. The plays are pretty enjoyable for the most part, and it's just a few hours out of your week. The midterm and finals (final paper and take home final exam) are pretty arduous, but Pease grades easily so there's no reason to stress. The lectures are incredibly dry and my sleep-deprived ass fell asleep during a few of them, but I didn't take notes on them, and just referred back to the powerpoints in Canvas for my essays. This course was very easy, and as someone dreading the LIT requirement, it is a great layup to get it out of the way.\"",
            "review 6: \"20S with Donald Pease: I don't know if I loved or hated this class to be honest. First of all, it's absolutely still a layup. No doubt about it- especially if you are in it primarily for the LIT distribution like I was. It gets you the distrib, but you barely have to do any reading. If you wanted to you could literally not read anything and still probably get an A and here's how: watch the plays on YouTube. He gives you the scripts to read but it's much more entertaining and efficient to just watch them online, and you can understand them better. The plays he chose get mixed reviews from me- some are amazing and others were...just...not my style. He's obsessed with the playwrights and it's fun to have a prof who is so passionate (and kind- no one can say a word against him on that front). I was frustrated with the paper topics for the midterm and exam though because in class he lectured all about the nuances of the plays which were interesting, but the prompts would always be about modernism/postmodernism/etc and how different plays conformed to those genres or dissented from them. In short I just didn't want to write about that and I doubt many people were psyched on that either. But I shouldn't complain because he's an easy grader (or so I think--we never got real grades b/c it was pass fail thanks to Covid, but he always had positive comments even if I barely bothered to check my work after writing an essay for his class). He was very out of touch with current norms for what students expect from a prof which got under my skin but in reality didn't matter a lot. Here are some examples: He never posted the essay prompts on canvas and would just tell us them on zoom (no clue how the other 50% of the huge class who never come to class found out tbh), wouldn't tell us things outright like single/double spaced, minimum length, etc. He would also have the TAs answer our many questions about his confusing and broad essay prompts even though they can't read his mind. Overall if you love genres of plays and enjoy older plays by Eugene O'Neill and others then this is the class for you! I'm still glad I took it for the distrib and because I liked learning about the plays, but overall was frustrated with him on various smaller things. Chalk it up to covid angst I guess. There are so many people in the class\"",
            "review 7: \"20S with Donald Pease: Took this class over zoom, but still found it pretty interesting. Pease is a very engaging and passionate prof which I appreciated. Would agree with other review that he would be unclear on some of the smaller details for our assignments.\"",

It lived up to its legendary status, even over zoom. I looked forward to class every single day and thoroughly enjoyed the assignments (three essays -- two timed prompts and one on whatever play you want to explore). He took time to meet for 30 minutes with all 150+ people in the class to discuss their papers, which was incredible and meant a lot.\"",
            "review 9: \"19S with Donald Pease: I signed up for this class not knowing exactly what to expect and ended up loving it. Professor Pease is very passionate about the subject and it was a great experience reading famous plays we've all probably heard about. He honestly gives great lectures. As long as you are willing to listen and take notes, it's a really worthwhile class and is a great way to get a LIT distrib. The workload isn't that bad. It's reading a pretty long play before each class (you don't have to read it too carefully, just understand what happened) and a few discussion posts throughout the term. The midterm isn't bad if you've read the plays and taken good lecture notes. The final essay also isn't too long and is really open-ended. If you are looking for a super easy A, it probably isn't the course for you. But if you are willing to pay attention in class and buy in, you will do well on the assignments and may walk away with some really great knowledge on really famous plays and literature. I loved it and highly recommend it!\"",
            "review 10: \"18S with Donald Pease: I took this because it was a layup and it is, but it simply isn't worth it. Pease is a painful lecturer who uses words that 90% of the class doesn't know. His lectures are incoherent and hard to follow. The readings are quite dense, but it is easy to sparknote them. The ID quizzes are so random that you need to just memorize super random facts. The papers are graded easily and it is nice to talk to Pease one on one when he schedules it for the final paper. Overall, there are just better layups to take, and it isn't worth taking a class that you aren't going to enjoy at all.\"",
            "review 11: \"17S with Donald Pease: This class is interesting if you do the reading, if you don't you'll be super lost in the lectures and on the exam. A lot of people crammed and didn't do very well on the IDs for the exam. However, there is only one final paper so the workload isn't intense. Pease is very intelligent and interesting once he gets into his rhythm but can be pretty dry. It is 100% a lecture class, so don't expect any class participation.\"",
            "review 12: \"17S with Donald Pease: This class is highkey a joke\u2014we read a play per class (most people didn't read them all, I think, but I did and they took around 2-4 hours each) and Pease discusses it during class with a Powerpoint. Attendance is taken once a week, and there are weekly discussion posts on Canvas. Pease's lectures were somewhat slow (when they actually made grammatical sense). To his credit, however, he puts a lot of time towards trying to help people and talk to people during office hours\u2014he ends up getting to know most of everyone's names in a 100 person class. The Powerpoints are all posted online before the midterm and final, they're pretty much unnecessary to do well in the class, though. The midterm includes 17 random, specific terms you have to identify from the books and an essay that I'm pretty sure everyone who wrote anything intelligible got almost a full score on. There was an essay due towards the end of the term (you pick your own prompt), that was also graded very leniently. The final is 17 ID's done in class and a take-home essay due the last day of finals. Chill class, interesting if you actually read the play and try to analyze them (very helpful to talk to Pease about them), but otherwise, definitely a layup.\""

AND if you want to do well on the exams and papers, i think it's necessary that you do the bulk, if not all of it. Professor Heffernan is really difficult to talk to to be honest. He kind of cuts you off all the time in an attempt to show he's listening, but he means really well and is extremely knowledgable. He reads his lectures. This has good points- he is ALWAYS extremely well prepared- and bad points- it means you have to forsake animation and spontaneity. BUT he is very witty and class is fast-paced enough that you don't end up looking at the clock too often. All in all, i'd recommend taking this course if you have the time to devote to it.\"",
            "review 2: \"02S with James A.: This class is quite a bit of work, but is very rewarding, as professor Heffernan is the best lecturing professor I've had at Dartmouth so far. He knows the Romantic Poetry amazingly well, and has the ability to hold his classes attention without powerpoint or snazzy presentations. Some visuals are present (Blake's stuff), but other than that, not many other visuals. Then again, they're not necessary. Work is heavy, as attendance is necessary and reading must be done on time (there is a lot of memorization of poetry involved). Midterm and final, and two papers made this class difficult, but it is worth taking despite the heavy workload. Unfortunately, 2003 Spring is Prf. Heffernan's last term teaching this class, as far as I know, but it's still a great course.\"",
            "review 3: \"02S with James A.: The Romantic era in British literature is arguably one of the best in all of English literature. The selections we read by Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron and Keats were SUPERB and representative of the era. Prof. Heffernan just reads his papers, which were actually quite interesting and not boring at all. Heffernan has a good sense of humor and speaks with enthusiasm; his readings were never dry. There was almost no class discussion, however. Take notes on what he says because he likes you to regurgitate on the midterm and final; in your own essays, however, it's okay to think on your own. I don't think Heffernan was too difficult a grader, but I didn't get an A either. Maybe if I had known to take notes for the midterm and final I could have done better.... Grades were determined by: three short papers, one 7-10 page paper, a midterm with essay questions, and a final with essay questions.\"",

This was an incredibly interesting class taught by a man who has a very real passion for the subject. Professor Heffernan has written a handful of books on various components of Romantic poetry (particularly on Wordsworth) and seems to be genuinely excited to chat during office hours.

Professor Will is knowledgable and very enthusiastic in general, but the major flaw of the class is that every class period is spent primarily on student presentations. When Professor Will did lecture, she was great, but there wasn't nearly enough of it. Overall, this is a great Period II for majors.\"",
            "review 2: \"05S with Barbara Will: but that's about it. I would have loved to hear Professor Will talk more in this class but mandatory student presentations that were supposed to be only 10-15 min quickly took up entire periods. The only problem I have with this is that it encourages too much amature English-major speculating when there are important things like meter and rhyme schemes, which no one knew, but that we only learned in the last full week of the course. So yeah, not enough on the standard interpretations of this poetry--oh that's the other thing: the course title says Romantic Lit., but all we did was English poetry. I was expecting more literature. Also there was waaaay too much Wordsworth for my taste and we spent one week on Shelley, two days on Keats and only one class on Byron! Papers (2) were both open topic and it wasnt mandatory to write on a poem we'd been assigned. There was only a mid term and no quizes. Good class for the period requirement, but not especially rigorous or mind-blowing.\""

Not only is he great at picking interesting readings (mostly nonfiction essays, and a few creative works and films) and promoting discussion, he stresses the importance of teaching something that will be remembered after the term ends. He thus doesn't stress the assignments or grades but wants you to take something away from the class. That said, your grade is based on participation, weekly discussion posts, three short midterm essays (very manageable), and an open-ended final project (pick any topic, and just create something). This class is definitely a layup if you just do the work and participate, but for the most part, the people who participate do the readings and want to engage with the course content. If not this class, I highly recommend taking a class with Bennett. He's so smart, caring for his students, and very understanding during a virtual term.\""

Otherwise, it would be pretty terrible. The first few weeks are spent learning about rhetorical theory, which Prof. Kuypers knows quite a bit about, but which is also totally unnecessary for what you'll be doing later on. When you finally get to reading speeches, those are interesting. Professor Kuypers gives some odd lectures which seem like history lectures at times, except with very shaky sources backing up his assertions. He will answer questions in class, and is pretty good about answering e-mails, but he is tough to meet with outside of class. Also, a word of caution: he takes himself and his course VERY seriously, and will expect you to as well. Plan on being very formal whenever you interact with him. And don't expect any concessions or reasonable treatment of complaints...he asked a question on the midterm about material that hadn't been covered and refused to throw out the question. The workload for the class is one midterm, one short paper (3 pages), and one longer (7-10 page) paper. Take this course if you really want to learn something about political rhetoric, but be prepared to deal with some nonsense from the prof.\"",

The subject matter is interesting, but anything cool you might be able to get out of it is totally negated by how terrible the Prof is. Kuypers can drain the fun / interest-level out of even the most interesting historical events and speeches. And that's the other thing: he talks about history like he is qualified to teach and analyze history when clearly he is not. It was so unclear whether we were sitting in a bad history class or just the worst class ever. It seems that both were true. Kuypers wants to teach history through the eyes of the people who gave famous and influential speeches, the problem is that that gives you the most biased and least accurate picture of historical events. Also, he only mildly succeeds in covering what *appears* to be a pretty heavy conservative bias. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT, EVEN IF YOU DO GET A DISTRIB OF SOME KIND.\"",

I was fooled - the ORC description is somewhat misleading in that it doesn't say that you spend a lot of time on THEORY of rhetoric, which, let's be honest here, is a lot of crap. So take this if you need either of those two distribs, otherwise, skip it. If you do take it, nail the two speeches (and dress NICELY -- Kuypers takes his class, and himself, very seriously), write a decent paper, and study relatively hard (class notes are fine) for the midterm, and you'll get the grade. If you're going to miss class, let him know, even give an excuse. I had the feeling that he took mental notes of who was and wasn't there.\"",

For example, on the first day of class, he gave us condescending directions on how to come to office hours -- if we must -- and on how to write a paper.

He's a brilliant professor who has impeccable command of the material, and is able to effectively hold the interest of the class. He's witty, entertaining, and interesting. The class was taught as a 9, but it was easily worth waking up for. A certifiable highlight of my Dartmouth experience.\"",
            "review 32: \"02X with Peter C.: Anyone who takes English 24 at Dartmouth - and I'd argue that this is a must, regardless of what you major in - simply has to take it with Saccio, not Crewe, Luxon, or Boose (in descending order of merit). Professor Saccio, as most people are aware, is a legend on campus and one of the nation's pre-eminent Shakespearean scholars. The reasons for this are numerous. 1) He really knows his Shakespeare. And I mean it. Hamlet and King Lear and Richard II are as much part of his life as Blitzmail and pong are part of the average Dartmouth student's. 2) He's an outstanding lecturer. It's no surprise that his lectures have been videotaped and sold for hefty sums. Condensing some of the most complex pieces of literature into three lectures is no mean feat, but Saccio pulls it off with depth and wit. Unlike some professors I could mention, he retains a fine sense of the aesthetic - as opposed to the ideological - dimension of Shakespeare's plays. 3) He has a feeling for the dramatic. Shakespeare was a playwright, not a novelist; his works are meant to be performed, not simply read. Saccio has spent much time not just studying, but also acting and directing Shakespeare, and he leverages this experience to great effect in his lectures (which are themselves performances). 4) He's a great teacher too. Do not let the somewhat stern instructions laid down in the syllabus put you off. He's a charming man who's very interested in getting to know students individually. Despite the workload that he set for himself this term (two classes, over a hundred papers to grade), he still finds time to chat with students over dinner and write detailed remarks on student papers. This class isn't that difficult: the weekly quizzes may seem annoying, but they compelled me to read the plays and discover for myself some real treats that I had not previously encountered (Measure for Measure, Richard II, Cymbeline). The rest of our grade consisted of a short interpretative essay (2 pages) and two longer papers (6 pages each). Because of time constraints, he cancelled the final exam and taught only nine plays, omitting Macbeth.\""

She focuses a lot on gender issues and power struggles in the plays, so you should hopefully be interested in those topics as well.

It was quite frustrating - she was quite disorganized, and would often be late, forgetting stuff, never handing back our papers, etc. But even worse was the dearth of information in her lectures that was both useful and true. Oftentimes, after those first few weeks, she would have no lecture at all, but would just kind of read out loud to us from the play, without much to say about it. The rest of the time, she'd either talk about something else besides the play we were supposed to be reading (e.g., a different play, cinematography, her personal life sagas), or she'd start harping on some point she'd come up with that seemed interesting until you realized it was not, in fact, true!!! What I mean by this is that she would regularly misquote key passages, get characters confused, make claims about the play that could be directly refuted by the text - to such an extent that one would wonder, 1, \"Has she even read this play?\" and 2, \"Why I am I bothering to even listen to this?\" Pretty disappointing, if you were hoping to learn.\"",

He treated us all like we had interesting things to say, and by the end of the term I definitely felt comfortable talking about Shakespeare (who, by the way, was ruined for me in high school--I thought I would hate this class when I was first assigned to it). We read a play a week, which was kind of overwhelming in that it took me a few hours to read each play, but at the same time, I think if we'd spent any more time discussing any one play, it would've been overkill. We also watched a few clips from the film versions of the plays in class, which was really helpful toward understanding tone and things like that. The assignments were easy and interesting--2 4-page papers, one research assignment where you basically got to go to Rauner and look at some aspect of Renaissance culture, one 6-page final paper, and one in-class final reading exam.

So what he did was make anyone who commented on or wrote on an idea that was NOT \"modern\" feel like a country bumpkin wasting his time. while we did not analyze the text into paralysis, as id feared, we did something worse in this class.

Let's get one thing straight: Professor Campos is AMAZING. F-ing awesome. For being a fairly young guy, his mind is completely filled with information about everything related to Shakespeare. Kids would ask dumb/random questions and he would always have an answer (like, \"was this Juliet's first kiss?\" and he would have an answer textually, historically, whatev). I always looked forward to what he'd have to say about plays and he never let me down. I liked that he gave us a manner in which to read each play (The Tempest--linguistic colonialism, Antony/Cleopatra--Orientalism, etc). I learned sooo much about Shakespeare, English culture during the Renaissane, contemporary and early-modern theory. I wasn't sure I was going to take this class but I'm extremely glad I did. There was slightly more work than most classes--3 papers, a final test, a research project--but I feel that I actually learned something from the work instead of it just being busy work. I don't even really care what grade I get because I appreciated how much I learned.

If you like Shakespeare, or hope to come out of this class liking Shakespeare, I can't say enough to encourage you to STEER CLEAR. He's awful. Incredibly superficial look at the plays, never actually examining the structure or the characters and, in general, sticking to an extremely cursory explanation of how modern schools of thought view Shakespeare. He's the kind of prof that says, \"Well, class, I had a waking dream about something vaguely related to the play in discussion. So I'm going to ad-lib a lecture somewhat based on it. And now we'll watch the movie version.\" And really, how can we do anything but a cursory look at the plays at one play a week? He also insisted on staying in the same room for the whole term, even though there clearly weren't enough chairs for the entire class and another room was available. I was a potential English major, and he's convinced me to stay away. One thing I will say--it's something of a gut course. Until I wised up midway through the semester, I was trying to read every single play and sonnet he assigned. Really, you can probably get away with doing maybe half of the reading.

We would discuss several passages in each play or some sort of overarching theme, but it always seemed a bit superficial. Campos is a pretty entertaining lecturer and has a good sense of humor, but I had heard so much about other Shakespeare profs, I was just hoping for something a little more memorable.

Luxon also gave an online quiz every week about the play, but you could take them as many times as you wanted...so they weren't hard at all. Luxon was a great prof overall. Although I didn't go to office hours, he did make himself available for those who needed to talk outside of class. The one draw back was that the class was a 9 three times a week in the summer...but i'd say it was well worth it.

One Shakespeare play a week is actually pretty pleasant, especially on a lovely summer saturday. There are semi-obnoxious aspects, like the online reading quizzes, but sometimes even those are kind of hilarious. Really, think of it as joining a book club for the summer. The lectures aren't over-analytical, and there are only two papers, so you only have to write on the plays you like. And you can annoy your friends by clamoring for cakes and ale, or perhaps by referring to one of them as othello-face. Or by lamenting the current unpopularity of the codpiece. But that would only win you popularity in the minds of all right-thinking people.\""

He would always answer questions, even if they were on a completely different topic from what he was teaching at the time. As a result, his lectures were sometimes hard to follow. It's difficult to participate since the class is so large, and participation is 10% of your grade.

Lectures could be very interesting and informative. If you're looking for an easy class, it's certainly that. And the readings are interesting. However, this class was also very frustrating. First, most people who took it didn't seem interested and did hardly any of the reading. People did discuss some during class, but it was pretty much all BS. Professor Edmondson's bias was extremely obvious - it was very clear that he wanted you to say everything was related to feminist or psycho-analytical interpretation. It's not difficult to come up with sexual interpretation for everything. (Ex: Professor (leadingly) says, \"What's the first thing that comes to mind when you read this description of blood running down Jesus's face [because of the crown of thorns]?\" Student: \"This clearly symbolized the menstrual period...\") There was very little attempt to actually figure out where the authors were coming from or what the works were really about. Much reference to \"recent critical analysis,\" in other words very smart, modern, atheist feminist professors attempting to impose their views on Medieval religious literature. To believe the analysis of the works carried out in this class, very religious writers in the Middle Ages were telling us that everyone goes to heaven regardless of religion, and fallic imagery was hidden behind every tower... This type of thing is easy to do - Don't bother with what the work actually says, just figure out what you want it to say and find some way to support that. And when students know what the professor wants them to say, it's much easier to make vague statements going along with his interpretation than to actually attempt to understand the works.\"",

The first two speeches are 5 minutes long and you argue opposite sides of the same issue. The third and final speech is 15 minutes long and you argue what you actually believe about the topic. By the end of the course you have researched your topic so much that you are something of an expert and you will have developed strong opinions about it. It is such a wonderful class.

The pronunciation is a bit more difficult, but Prof. Travis provides plenty of opportunities to work on Middle English sounds in and out of class. The class is never the same; it was often mostly guided discussion with Prof. Travis occasionally lecturing in between student comments. His lectures/comments are always very in depth and insightful but not repetitive or dominating. The papers offer a variety of ways to approach the text, including close readings, wider theses, and an opportunity for a longer researched final. Prof. Travis gives you a choice on what combination of these you would like to do. There were several events that really kept things fresh, including an assignment to record a reading of any selection from the Tales, a reading by a Chaucer expert and former prof, and even a chance to see some original manuscripts and prints in the special collections. Overall, the reading was tough but not ridiculous, the papers were fair and fun to do (also, Prof. Travis took several opportunities to work through my papers with me), and in the end the Tales are shown in the best light they possibly could be.

Course assessment-wise, it is a decent amount of work (you give at least one 2-3 minute speech weekly and two 8-9 minute speeches in the 6th and 9th week) but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT! The speeches are fun to compose (on topics from your first public speaking experience to something/someone you'd like to pay tribute to) and require moderate practice time. Also, additional reading is reasonable and if you can't get to all of it for class, it's really fine, he usually just briefly touches on it.

You can't be the same old speaker that walked into the class by the end of it and I'm almost positive you won't be.

I'm really glad I did, and I'm really glad I had Julie. She was excellent at critiquing our speeches (and we really didn't make many of them) and I feel that I improved a lot thanks to her suggestions. She gives great feedback about the points you make--not quite so much about the delivery, but I think she was trying to get us to start being coherent before working on any fancy delivery. Her lectures were mostly about the theoretical aspects of oration, which I didn't find all that interesting since I was taking the class just to gain the skills of speaking, but maybe you're into that--if you're interested more in the theory, I think you could also take the persuasive speaking class. We did see examples of good speakers in the lectures, some from Julie's previous classes and other famous people like Obama and MLK. The speeches that we gave were OK, I have to practice them that much and got pretty good grades. Just make sure you meet with Julie one-on-one, there's ample opportunity for that. The critiques are pretty easy too, I think Julie graded them easily to raise our grades if we got bad grades on the speeches (she graded those fairly toughly). An unexpected benefit of taking this class has been that I've become a better writer--it helps you learn how to organize your thought in a clear fashion that caters to the listener/reader. I think everyone in the class was a lot more articulate by the end. A friend in Compton's section said she had to memorize an entire speech by a famous person, which sounds scary (and not that practical). They also speak every class, which I kind of wish we had--we gave a total of four speeches during the term, and I'd like to have worked on my delivery a little more. And a cautionary note--if you have really bad stage fright, that might be something to get over before taking this class. Anxiety was not something addressed in this class. That said, our class was a really nurturing environment that's really accepting of most speech topics (you can talk about whatever you want, and there were some controversial subjects discussed).

            "review 1: \"02F with Alan T.: Chaucer is a wonderful author, but he takes time to get used to. Unless you've had prior experience with him in high school (which I didn't), don't expect to be able to jump right in and start talking about him the way you can with, say, a contemporary novel. Once you familiarize yourself with his language and style, however, he becomes a delight to read (especially aloud). This class really does let you sink yourself gradually into the Chaucerian experience: a very different one from what we are used to (The modern novel, Shakespeare, even Dante), but no less valuable or important. It's a lot of work, to be sure. Assessments, from quizzes to papers of varying lengths to an audio tape of yourself reading Chaucer in Middle English, are dished out on a almost a weekly basis. That and the reading make for, well, an absorbing experience. Some of it is actually enjoyable: I had great fun with the tape and really enjoyed the final exam. Prof. Gaylord has a warm sense of humor and does his best to make classes informal and participative. He takes a genuine interest in his students and is great to talk to out of class. Pity he will not be teaching English 20 again - he's retiring pretty soon. However, before he retires, he will be teaching three other classes: on King Arthur, Norse epics, and Robin Hood, if I'm not mistaken. Those of you interested in really old literature should jump at the chance to take them.\""

When we got to the Icelandic saga half, he was as astounded with the literature as we probably were. Basically, he had never read the sagas and had definitely never taught them, but it was sort of fun that he was reacting to them the same way we might have been. I don't mean to say he isn't knowledgeable, though, because he is. The first of the term we spent working on Old English and Beowulf in particular. We translated some Old English pieces, which was a little silly because it was like an exercise in using a dictionary. But it was still cool to have a better understanding of where our modern language came from. AND I loved Beowulf, loved it. I think I loved the sagas even more though. Awesome stuff. Everyone in the class is part of a presentation, which was ok. I think most people just wikipediaed their subject the night before (I did) so it might not have been the most informative part ever...and some of them weren't that interesting. Other than that, there are a few small assignments, like the translations. Then there was one midterm paper, which was only like 4-6 pages or something on Beowulf. Easy. For the final paper you were allowed to write a parody of an Icelandic saga, which I chose to do. Most fun assignment EVER. No, seriously. It was so nice during finals to be like, \"well, I'm off to write my saga.\" And then write about people cutting each other's heads off and getting drunk. My favorite part of the class was Tomas, the Icelandic kid who came to visit. That probably won't happen again though. But it was cool. He was a direct descendent from Snorri Sturluson AND Egil Skallagrimsson, which means nothing to you, the reader, but it was awesome for all of us in the class.\"",

The class was really big (for an English class), and the room was a large lecture hall, which made discussion difficult. Travis tends to lecture rather than ask students to discuss, which isn't bad, because he's an excellent lecture. This was his first time teaching the Icelandic Saga portion of the class, but he was up front with us about the fact that he was learning the material along with us. The material itself is very different from what gets studied in a typical English course. Beowulf, despite being so old, is still relatively manageable to analyze, but the sagas are just weird. They're quite entertaining in places, horribly boring in others, and very worth studying, but in more from a cultural perspective than a literary one. In terms of assignments, there's an easy group presentation, a translation test (basically an exercise in using the glossary) and two papers, one on Beowulf (4-6 pages) and one on the sagas (10-12 pages). You can write your own saga for the longer paper, which takes a lot of the research work away.\""

What really annoyed me was that while the final was reflective of what we had been learning all term, it was not reflective of how we had been learning and practicing all term. We only practiced stuff like that which was on the final at the very end of the course. Pulju is a great prof. and makes class very entertaining. He learns everyone's names, encourages class participation (and even calls on people randomly), and his enthusiasm for the subject really shows. Remember that if this class is taught by the Linguistics department it is a LING class, not English. When it is taught by the English department, it is an ENGL class (I have gathered). This class was a LIT distrib., but it is NOT a lit class in any way (so it's good if you really hate lit and are more of a mathy logic-y person). So it didn't follow the ORC description very well because the ORC is really trying to describe two classes -- the LING one and the ENGL one -- as one. So, great class, but beware.

He walks in and for a moment you think that he's going to be some quiet, awkward professor scared of the kids... but then he comes out of his shell and talks loudly, knows what he is saying, and has a great sense of humor. He learns everyone's name, and tries to call on just about everyone every class, whether you want him to or not. It's a great tactic... especially when you're falling asleep. He's not offended, but you just look silly waking up when he calls on you. So... if you like linguistics, take it with Pulju.

The second half is the current status of English throughout the world, which is much more interesting. There were 3 take home problem sets, 1 in class midterm (which sucked) and then 10-15 pg research paper on a topic of your choice. Word on the paper, it's reallllly broad.

It was kind of annoying sometimes that despite the fact that we students would not be able to make heads or tails of a reading, the prof insisted on letting us know as little of his interpretation as possible. The assignment descriptions were vague; it was nice being able to pick our own topics with the range of possibilities being very broad, but on the other hand, the prof sometimes seemed to think that what constituted a good paper/presentation should be self-evident. Maybe I was too conditioned by the rest of the school system, but those weren't grading criteria that I was used to. On the other hand, for the papers, there were no page limits/requirements at all, which can be good or bad depending on your style, and he allowed extensions, no questions asked, as long as you asked 48 hours or more before the time the paper was due.

Didn't get my grade on that yet, but given the range of subjects available, if you want to take this class, you can probably find a topic you'll enjoy. This is definitely a lecture class- i think maybe 8 questions were asked in class all term. But Wykes is an interesting lecturer, and he covers a wide range of the important aspects of the New Testament and its analysis (with the notable exception of Romans, which he classified as too hard to cover in a few days). Overall, an interesting class with a light workload. You won't have to do the reading, but if you're like me, you'll want to.\"",

From a secular viewpoint, Professor Wykes presents the bulk of the New Testament in an interesting way. Christian students may find it necessary to suspend their beliefs for awhile and consider some of the literary problems of the Bible--questions of authorship, etc. The exams are two take-homes, and one final paper that counts for half the grade. No inane memorization--really a well crafted course. And he is a good speaker, even early in the morning.\"",

The professor gives a really balanced treatment, and is very moderate in his interpretations - his political leanings don't seem to measure into his interpretations, and this was much appreciated. The two midterms are takehome open-book, and were fairly straightforward if one had attended class. There is a final paper, 10 pages, which is basically on the topic of the student's choice. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the bible and its history, and also to anyone who wants a good English class with a good prof.\""

However, Halasz is a great prof who gives very engaging lectures (when she has to, it was mostly a discussion based seminar style class), and does a good job of allowing for freedom during the discussion while keeping it relevant and tying ideas together. The readings for the most part were fascinating and the graded assessments helped foster understanding of the material.

Prof. Halasz did her best to glue together a lot of these readings, a did a pretty good job with it. We had quite a range of students in the class (from English majors to CS nerds), so our class discussions tended to branch out all over the place. She did a good job of assigning amorphous papers, too, so the students could explore their own interests within the 'old and new media' context/framework.

Theoretically, they were only supposed to be 5 minutes each with a few more minutes for questions after that, but the prof didn't cut people off so in practice, the two each class that we usually did would sometimes take up half the entire class (this is a 2A, note), and it was just so deadly dull and idiotic. Often, we would have to rush through a discussion of the actual readings, and some got skipped entirely. Particular discussions did not continue into future classes, so we never fell behind, but with the lack of a class participation requirement, few if any people actually did the readings, reinforcing the prof's tendency to dither and waste time at the beginning of classes for fear of running out of things to say. The prof is a great guy, but he can be really insecure about his teaching, and in this case, it greatly and detrimentally affected the class. There's two essays, a take-home final (a selection of shorter essays), 3 paragraphs about the old books at Rauner, and the oral presentation. Be warned that the prof is a REALLY hard grader, and focuses on the original, critical thinking abilities that we generally get so little practice with, so don't be surprised if you get your essay back with a worse grade than you were expecting. BS, filler, and regurgitation really don't fly in this class, especially since there's no page number or word count guidelines on the essays. If you get even an A- on one, you might as well kiss the ground because it's THAT hard to get. Don't worry, the prof curves the class at the end. The readings kind of come in handy for the final, but only for that so you can scrape by without doing them. That's partly what made class discussions so miserable, like I said before. There were also some requirements to post to the discussion board on Blackboard and to make postcards at the printshop, but the former got dropped because those discussions didn't take off, and the latter ... most people did them, but some didn't bother, and I'm not sure their grades were actually affected by it because the prof didn't seem to be keeping track of who had done it and who hadn't. I was hoping for a lot more from this class than I got, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this class, at least until the prof has been teaching it for longer and has more confidence in his mastery of the material.\"",

If you're just looking for a pat on the head for turning something in with a whole bunch of academic words, don't take this class. And if you bullshit in a paper, he'll call you on it. Still, when you actually come up with something creative, the credit you get then means more. Also, his \"lectures,\" which end up being 60% discussion, are never boring and are really accessible to understand. I know some people got annoyed this term when he talked to us for awhile at the beginning of class about random non-class related things, but I kind of liked that too. It put everyone at ease. And, I agree with the other reviewer that I didn't really care for the presentations, but that's just because I suck at presenting, not any specific failing on his part. I think that's about it.

Unlike the occasional professor who tries too hard to be entertaining or others who give an impression of not liking undergraduates, Edmondson is both eager to help you learn and just happens to be extremely funny- you will laugh hard at least once a class. Furthermore, for all you neo-con ann coulter groupies out there run ragged by liberal professors who who seem incapable of listening to your opinion- Edmondson is definitely not your political ally, but he will be respectful, will take what you say seriously rather than be dismissive or seem personally insulted (even if he is- one student attacked the entire idea of literary theory and he didn't flinch) And if you are one of those dirty neo-cons, having a professor who won't look down his or her nose at you is pretty important in a class that serves as an introduction to (overwhelmingly far Left) 20th century academic thought. Regardless of your political affiliation, Literary Theory more directly than any other class I've taken at Dartmouth is a work out for the old standby justification for a liberal arts education- \"critical thinking skills.\" Thinking you might possibly understand what Derrida wrote in \"Of Grammatology,\" is something of a feat in itself, while understanding many of the texts you read in this class is often it's own reward.

To me, it seems more interesting and productive to actually analyze literary texts than to look at something like \"Winter Carnival\" or \"Dartmouth speak/lingo\".

He makes it understood that he is interested in conversing with each student as a capable individual, and subsequently provides useful criticism on paper drafts, and added insight to class readings. My only reservation about the course is that students are thrown in head-first, and asked to make sense of extremely difficult texts off the bat.

            "review 5: \"22F with Matthew Ritger: This class was AMAZING. This was my first class from the English department and it did not disappoint. Professor Ritger is so knowledgable about the material that it honestly feels that he could talk about a single word in a single line for an entire class period, which we did sometimes. The class was broken up into 5 writing exercises that were 30% of your grade, 4 discussion posts on the OED (more on this later) for 20%, 15% for participation, and the rest split evenly 17.5% for two essays. The writing exercises were very fun and included everything from writing a sonnet to editing a soliloquy for performance. The discussion posts had us look at a single word in one of the plays and then use the Oxford English Dictionary to trace the multiple meanings of the word during Shakespeare's era and the etymology of the word. Participation was easy since often you didn't actually have to read the plays to participate in discussion since Ritger would provide context to understand what we were talking about. I thought the class would be mostly about understanding Shakespearean language like how we read Shakespeare in my high school classes, but we really dug deeper into the content than I though possible. Ritger mentioned on day one that this term he changed the course significantly though. We only read 5 plays albeit going much more in depth: As You Like It, Macbeth, Richard II, The Tempest, (originally supposed to be Much Ado About Nothing but the day of caring required us to read something shorter) and HAMLET. Ritger has made me a mega-ultra fan of all of these plays besides The Tempest. With Hamlet we take an deep dive and actually watch a modern adaptation by Robert Icke which was super cool and had us comparing how he edited the play to how other editors had. By far the coolest aspect of the class, however, was the option to skip the final essay and instead perform a scene or soliloquy from one of the plays (but not Macbeth for some reason). I have never performed in my life but memorizing a Hamlet soliloquy has brought me closer to the text than I think I've ever been. I now and forever will have a party trick that I can perform Hamlet's first soliloquy. Also this class is a HUGE layup too, so there's that.\"",

Finals and midterms were pretty much the same, with 2 essays (choosing from a pool of prompts) of 4 pages each, maximum. He had optional X-hours for reading groups, which helped in the beginning when I had no experience with Shakespearean English. This class could be a layup if you're good at writing and willing to do the reading. This was my first term here, and the class was certainly accessible in that regard.

This class certainly lived up to my expectations. It was a rapid introduction to various theorists, whose essays we read and discussed in class. Prof. McKenzie wanted to run the class as a seminar and really involved the small group of students. He was very knowledgeable about the difficult material, but remained friendly and responsive to his students. Prof. McKenzie encouraged us to use the theories we discussed in class to analyze and theorize our own lives, which was often a difficult proposition. As a result, the class was not only challenging because of the difficult and dense theoretical texts but also because of the need to be constantly self-reflective. I'm glad the class was as challenging as it was, though, and I feel like Prof. McKenzie helped students effectively rise to the level of difficulty of the texts and projects.\"",

The readings were extremely challenging, but McKenzie organized the course in such a way that every reading, every assigment and every classroom activity was well-motivated. All students participated, which is a rare event in an English class! McKenzie required us to blitz him responses to each reading on the night before class, so he could ensure that everybody was prepared. We wrote three papers, and each was tied to our progress in learning about humanism, \"critical humanism,\" posthumanism, or \"strategic humanism.\" The first paper was an analysis of a text, object, or event, using one of the theories we had discussed. The second paper was an anslysis of an aspect of ourselves. The third paper was to make theory relevant to everyday life--he chose for us the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, which was breaking news at the time. This is an excellent course, although the title should not be termed \"literary theory.\" The only literary texts we read in that class, as I recall, were short stories by Poe and Borges and the book \"Barthes\" by Roland Barthes. One last thing about McKenzie: on the day that papers are due, he assigns no reading. Instead, he spends class time having each student discuss his or her paper. It was so interesting to hear what other students were writing about. I wish more professors did this. It helped shape the class into a true intellectual community.\"",

That said, if you're an English major, you need to take it. If you're not, it might be nice to anyway. In both cases, McKenzie makes a subject that could be lethal quite a bit of fun. About the only complaint I have about this course is that the readings (which were, appropirately, long and involved and difficult to understand) did not describe the theories we were studying--McKenzie had us read articles which applied the theory directly, and from the articles, we reasoned what the theory tried to \"do.\" In this pursuit, McKenzie was lively, energetic, and dedicated to making sure that each student understood what was going on. He actually goes so far as to make theory matter in real life (our semiotic breakdown of the Dartmouth homepage comes to mind). If you want to take literary theory, be aware that it's a lot of work which is frequently very trying. Also be aware that McKenzie is by far the best professor for the topic.\""

However, as far as teaching ability goes...well, literary theory is not her forte. The material in this class is exceptionally difficult, and don't expect her to clarify it at all. Particularly during the psychoanalysis and post-structuralist sections of the course, her responses to in-class questions would frequently be, \"I don't know, that's a good question, what do you think?\" It is the responsibility of a professor to be able to explain material, not the student. That's why you go to class. Even when not directly asked questions, her own lectures smacked of confusion and uncertainty. She would quote passages in theory and then follow them with no explanation at all, sometimes saying, \"I don't really get it.\" Why does she read it aloud if she can't even explain it to us? She really made no concerted effort to see that the class understood the material, which was probably because she didn't understand a lot of it herself. Once we got to feminism things got a little better, but it would've helped a lot if she had gotten someone else to teach the parts of the class she couldn't. Other issues: Most of her practical applications of theory had to do with her son and daughter; every class she would talk about them, which would lead to tangents to her family life in general, and it would be forever until we got back to the topic at hand. I wouldn't be surprised if she has ADD because she absolutely cannot keep focused on a topic. Also, she has no tolerance for viewpoints other than her own. She would frequently make offensive comments in passing simply because she found it impossible that someone would believe anything else, which led to people in the class staring at each other in shock, unable to believe that a professor would be able to get away with such propaganda in class. And, unfortunately, this affected her grading too: if you didn't write exactly what she believed, she considered it wrong and graded you accordingly. This worries me a lot, because I don't like being graded as if what I'm writing as wrong when the person doing the grading doesn't even understand the material herself. Ivy might understand the material, I don't know. But she definitely could use a lesson in how to teach it. This is a critical class for people planning on doing theses, so the department should make sure it's taught by someone who knows what she's talking about for all the theories, not just for feminism. By the way: there's a paper due almost every week, and theory is incredibly hard to think through. This is without question not only the hardest English class I've taken at Dartmouth, but the hardest class I've taken period, including science classes.\"",
            "review 3: \"02S with Ivy Schweitzer: It's strange to feel the need to write a review strictly to criticize a professor, as I've never felt inclined to write ANY review before now, but with Prof. Schweitzer I must warn interested students as follows: First, she comes into class with a strong agenda - specifically, that if you don't think \"her\" way, you're not thinking the \"right\" way. For example, of the three most difficult concepts and theories in contemporary literary theory that we \"should\" have addressed in some detail - Post-structuralism, Marxism, and Psychoanalysis, we spent only one week discussing each, as opposed to the two weeks we spent on feminism, a movement much more easily grasped than the previous three. She obviously taught \"her\" way, without regard to the interests or needs of the students. Second, her lectures are poor, as her personal anecdotes inhibit her ability to truly teach the material. Instead of talking about difficult questions in literary theory, she instead told us about her daughter (who is very cute but not a good example of Derridian thought). Third, her grading seems rather arbitrary. This is, of course, coming from a student who didn't do nearly as well as I would have liked, so keep that in mind, but I honestly feel her grading was based more on whether she agreed with the perspective you took rather than the quality of your argument. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, she just doesn't teach well. She did not approach the material in a helpful way in class, nor did her assignments test our knowledge of the theories we had just discussed. I would HIGHLY suggest this course, provided another professor (prof. Will, or prof. Travis) were teaching it. But do no take this class with Prof. Schweitzer, as frustration will the be the only thing you get from it. Sincerely, ~me\""

More so than any other class I've taken in my years at Dartmouth, it challenged me to develop my critical and literary thinking techniques and to broaden my mind through the reading of Shakespeare. The class is definitely not a layup though. Over the course of 10 weeks, you read 8 plays in chronological order. It changes from term to term but for us, we read Midsummer Night's Dream, Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, Measure for Measure, The Winter's Tale, Othello, I Henry IV, and Henry V. Each play is lectured on/discussed for three class periods, and following the second lecture, you are required to turn in a \"Blog Post\" of 500-700 words. These posts are public and fall into some rough categories (Keyword Analysis, Performance Analysis, Scholarly Critique, and Imagery), but uncategorized entries are also allowed. The grading on these is tough, and they make up 40% of the term grade. In addition to the Blog Posts, Halasz has you write a minimum of two papers of roughly 6-8 pages each. The first is a fairly standard close reading analysis and the second is wide open and can be written on any 2-3 scenes or plays that share some common sense or theme. Finally, for the final, you can either opt to perform a scene from one of the plays you have read or you are free to do a take-home exam with 2-3 short essays. Beyond the grades though, Halasz's class has been extremely interesting and engaging. I am not an English major and have relatively little experience reading Shakespeare, but if you are willing to put in the time and effort, you can gain a great deal from Halasz's class. She is very willing to assist with papers and blog posts in office hours and maintains a classroom atmosphere that is light, engaging, and enjoyable. I recommend this class to anyone willing to put in some serious work in the study of Shakespeare, but let it be known that the rewards far outweigh the costs (just don't take this with other rigorous classes).\"",

Unfortunately, the absurd grading made this course more stressful than an intro English course that I took for a distrib should have been. 40% of grade came from weekly \"blog post\" homework assignments. The rubric for these assignments was needlessly strict, and didn't allow for creativity or free-minded interpretation of the material. They were also graded harshly, which seems weird for what she originally described as a casual homework, and even though my posts improved from week to week I was given the same grade on each one. She would include almost no comments on these assignments so I didn't know what she wanted to me to change. A couple times she wrote that my homeworks were \"adequate but uninteresting.\" It felt like she had decided in the beginning of term what grade I deserved and she just kept giving it to me. She definitely picked favorites, as well, and grades reflected that. Maybe I could have done better in the course if I had been willing to put 3 hours into a 500-word blog post every week, in addition to reading an entire play every week.

The course does well with the normal analysis of plot and characters and motifs, but I think Gamboa is at his best when discussing why, on a visceral level, Shakespeare resonates even to this day and how the plays are so carefully crafted, in every line, to foment this resonance. You read ten plays in ten weeks, which seems like a lot but really isn't because you so rarely have other work (it was I think 3 small papers that you'll finish within a week if you're busy).

The feedback you receive on papers is extremely helpful and always put in a positive light, so he makes you WANT to improve your writing. Highly recommend this class for the distributive requirement or if you just like Shakespeare.\""

I would say that this class turned me into a major, so it was a big success. The material can be rough, however, depending on what type of English person you are. The more philosophical type will thrive. The creative writing people, surprisingly, all seemed to do very well, even if they didn't always agree with the readings we were doing.

Ultimately I think Crewe helps you get a sense of things, and the others in the class are varied in their experience so you're by no means the only person who might have difficulty. Despite the difficulty, some of the readings were very interesting. Still, I felt like a lot was crammed, and I wished we had just spent more time on certain concepts or authors... things got confusing. He assigned a multiple choice final which I thought was awful and hard -- very counterintuitive to the course. I think everyone did badly on it, though, so he must've curved nicely because I ended up with a really great grade -- probably from the final paper, which is the thing you should really focus on, as well as class participation.

Wykes's style is to assign passages of the bible and then to lecture on them. He uses almost no outside sources - this was my biggest problem with the class. He harbors personal prejudices - an animosity towards established religion, for example - that, while not offensive, certainly come to light in his lectures; to me, the lectures were always a bit suspect because of this. Is his opinion slanted? In some occasions, yes; his prejudice translates to a misunderstanding of the early development of NT understanding. Take what Wykes says with a grain of salt.

In the beginning, each student wrote a short story for the class to comment on; it was so pointless. I felt I got little more than grammar corrections as feedback. The class bearly focused on how to improve prose writing. Probably 90 % of the classes were spent bickering on what to write the book about, which was changed about 5 times anyway. I really thought the class was going to sit down and carefully plan out a decent book where everyone would contribute. Instead, we came up with some melodrama about 16 random characters that didn't fit well together. It seemed as the end of term neared and our story got more ridiculous, Hebert got more annoyed with us. He is an experienced writer and knows what he's talking about, but he seldom made comments. Altogether, I think the people in the class didn't mesh well, making it difficult to find common ground to write a book about.

If you have even a modicum of interest in becoming an author, this is the class for you. A bona-fide author teaching you some of the basic tips and tools of his trade can be very exciting. Be warned, though. Some of this information comes in bursts, but just be patient. Class discussions are always lively and fun, and I honestly like all the people who were in my class. It does not hurt at all that this class is mostly free-style writing (my class chose to write a fiction over non-fiction) and that you only have to read one other novel as the sum of your workload. Of course, this lack of a heavy workload just means that what you turn in had BETTER be your best work/effort, or you'll be sorry. It's a great class.

With that said, most of the material is fascinating and relevant to the subject. Be warned, although the course guide doesn't specifically mention this, the class is centrally focused on Asian American sexuality and gender issues. Santa Ana is a wonderful prof. He devotes more time to editing essays than most profs on campus. He also provides a 1+ paged, single-spaced, typed evaluation of you paper and gives you a chance to rewrite it. He's a very nice prof and gives good help during office hours. Although subject-matter can be painstakingly narrow at times, overall the class is well worth taking (even if you're not Asian American).\"",

He also makes himself available to talk about your papers and stuff (actually, he definitely encourages *coughforcescough* you to talk to him about your first paper).

Thus, I felt that I couldn't get used to his requirements since we had only so few chances to actually write. Even then, Santa Ana's required writing style is very rigid and he just wants you to follow a particular format, which I could not adapt to. The courseload wasn't too well organized as we had almost no work for the first half of the course and then had a mountain of work towards the end and I would have preferred more time between the mid-term paper and the final one. I wish I had taken another writing seminar as I don't think I learnt very much about writing from this one.\""

I guess I didn't like the way the class was conducted - it seemed to be the same everyday: read short sotry at home, come in class and seperate it into parts, hear Wykes talk about something and then participate. Still, the stories were really good, and made for very little reading while still keeping my attention. From what I've heard, seminars were pretty bad for everyone; at least Wykes made us laugh, didn't take himself too seriously, and didn't assign too much work.

Professor Wykes really encourages creativity and is open to all kinds of ideas. But caution, if you are not confident with your analytical writing skills, don't take this course. The way I understood it, freshman seminars are supposed to solidify your analytical writing skills, and there should be an emphasis on research. If you're confident in these areas - go ahead and take this seminar - it's really enjoyable. But if not, consider taking a course that will help you refine these skills.

The final is a ~12 page memoir/10 min presentation to the class about your life on basically any aspect that you choose. It's less intense than a research paper! A lot of work goes into the last project, but you get to write about your experiences so it's something that isn't boring. Plus, it's due before finals... so one less thing to stress about during finals period. Class size tends to be small (I had 8-9 students in my class) which allows for open discussion in an atmosphere that isn't intimidating. Prof O is one of the reasons I initially choose this course. I'd taken 2 classes from him previously (Eng5 co-taught & ENVS1) and loved the energy he brings to each lecture/discussion. He has a totally unique aspect on teaching... very interactive and planar with his students. DEF take his course! We went outside for a few classes to enjoy the beautiful spring weather.\"",

It is technically considered an English class, but don't be fooled. It is an environmental studies class. Course Structure: The class was based around reading a book a week. The books were the slowest I have ever read, and I didnt think that they had any redeeming value. There are 2 5-page papers (1 creative, 1 expository), weekly reading responses (that make you want to puke- Terry makes it pretty obvious what you are supposed to say) and then a 15 page creative final paper. Professor Osborne: Terry is a good guy, he just doesn't have a clue how to teach an English seminar. He was very set in his own interpretations, and did not appreciate students venturing into views contrary to his. Terry's grading of paper's reflected this. His classes were focused around lectures, and whenever the rare discussion would occur, it had a third-grade feeling to it as we had to raise our hands and wait to be called on. Conclusion: Take this class if you genuinely care about your relationship with the natural world, a lot of my classmates seemed to get a lot out of this class.

The graphic novels didn't take too long to get through, but don't get me wrong-this is not a class for slackers. Professor Chaney expects a lot from the 3 papers. And while he encouraged class discussion (and even awkward silences), I honestly enjoyed his lectures the most. I had no idea you could read so much into comics. People will say that you get what you put into a course and this holds true for this seminar. But Professor Chaney made it that much easier to put that effort into the class.\"",

Obviously the actual reading flew by, but the underlying meanings within the novels were very interesting and deep. And Professor Chaney is a lot of fun and the discussion in the class was awesome.

In addition, we also read two supplementary texts: Reading Autobiography and Understanding Comics. We wrote a total of three 5-page analytical papers. Prof. Chaney gave a lot of freedom regarding the paper topics. He returned the papers quickly and gave a lot of feedback. He also gave the option to re-write papers and then averaged the two grades if need be. We also wrote several 1-page papers near the end of the term, which I found very helpful before writing the final 5-page paper. At the end of the term, we also created our own comics (5-9 panels) and presented them to the class. We also met/video-conferenced with four of the authors/artists on the reading list, which was a unique experience. Overall, this class was demanding but very rewarding. Prof. Chaney is witty and very knowledgeable. He will definitely challenge you to improve your writing. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to put in the effort he expects, you will be rewarded.

HOWEVER, if I had Billy Pilgrim's ability to time-travel back in time (if you take this class, you'll soon learn what I'm talking about), I would not take this class because it is clearly meant for English majors (I am not an English major). The professor's expectations were very high, and if you are not very skilled in writing, you may end up with a bad grade. Since I came from a garbage high school, I have a very limited vocabulary and a pathetic way with words. Lucky for me, style is huge factor in McCann's grading. I'm basically not expecting an A for this class. If you are a hard sciences/math/econ major, like me, do yourself a favor and DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! Go take a lay-up that will get you some distribs instead. Also, please also read my comments for \"Workload\" because I think those comments offer some valuable discretion (or advice? Like I said, I'm terrible with words). Workload: I consider this class to be the biggest mistake of my college career thus far. As I said previously, I firmly believe that the writing seminar is a scam, so if you are a hard sciences/math/econ major, try to go for the Theater for Social Change class, which gives basically any student an A. Although the median grade for this class is an A, be aware that almost everyone in this class is going to be an English, or some form of humanities, major. Just to give you some perspective, for my Writing 5 course with Professor Piper, I got a B+/A- on my first essay and an A- on the second essay. Back then, I was a TERRIBLE writer. I became significantly better in McCann's class, and I put in like 5 times the effort, but even so, I am 99% sure I didn't get an A.

Definitely had a few almost all-nighters, but that's mostly reflective of my writing style rather than the workload.

I thought the readings would be interesting, because I like Poe, but it's impossible to read all of it. Also, Renza comes up with interpretations of the text that are soo far-fetched and you'll undoubtedly conclude that he's making it all up. Also, he wrote one of the books on Poe that we have to read for the class. It's cool that he knows so much about Poe, but that means that its hard for you to have any originality in your ideas, because he's heard them all. Also, I don't think he grades fairly at all.

This course was doomed when it was scheduled as a 2A; I found it impossible to stay alert for two hours at the end of the day. That's just too much Poe and Renza for me! The readings for the course were pretty interesting. You learn pretty quickly which readings you have to do and which ones you can skip. The papers were more difficult.

If you are interested in literary theory, this class will never get old. Renza spends most of the class discussing various interpretations of Poe's works which make sense as he explains them if you make the effort to follow his train of thought.

If you manage to pay attention the entire time that Renza speaks (two hours!), you'll see that he really is funny. The things he says are sometimes out there but interesting nonetheless. He's also very accessible and encourages students to go to office hours. He also answers blitzes reasonably fast (I once blitzed him while writing a paper at 12:30am and he answered within ten minutes). The papers increase in length with each one, so it's easy to adjust to what's expected of you in the papers (something thoughtful and original).

You get to read all these tales and learn about Poe's life, which was sort of tragic.

Also, he got REALLY into the lectures, a lot of yelling, which helped keep you intersted and--more importantly--awake. I highly suggest this class for your seminar! After talking to other students in other seminars, it seems like this is one of the best choices (both due to the prof and the material and the amount of time it requires).\""

We had a read a new book each week (sounds manageable) but we also had to write a short essay once a week. It sounds not too bad, but for me it felt a little oppressive at times. Professor: Aden was a great professor. He's interesting and knows how to really push your writing. He doesn't always know what to do to keep a discussion going, or how to explain his concept of a thesis--which is normal, just difficult. Workload: I felt that the workload was pretty tough. There was a whole lot of writing, but if you can find a Seminar with minimal workload/writing, you're probably in the class everyone else wanted. If you like science fiction literature, take Literature of the Machine, but expect to do a lot of tough writing--6 two page essays and 2 longer ones--but at least it'll improve your writing abilities.\"",

At first, it was tough to get your head around what he was looking for, but once you do it was an amazing feeling. It was like being freed to think about the topics.

Professor Sleigh is intensely passionate about poetry, but I think he sometimes carries the whole poet/artist cliche a little too far. He doesn't use blitz, and even though he has office hours, he rarely is there for you to use them - something that gets pretty problematic when you need help on a paper or while reading a tough poem. Oh, and he believes that creative writing is pretty much a you-have-it-or-you-don't skill, making all his students wonder why he is even there. All in all, a good class to take if you are really open to deep discussions about poetry and meaning and stuff like that, but if you are looking for something more conventional, you may want to think twiice about it.\""

He will also meet with you in case you have any specific questions you want to address in your writing, and he responds promptly to his emails.

Be prepared to talk a lot about your own personal history and background; prof chee was always really interested in our own narratives. The essays were short, a minimum of 1000 words and research. The research was not bad because it was mainly to learn about family history, so you had to talk to your family members and do more historical research.

The readings, which allegedly change each year according to each class' declared interests, were an interesting mix of a few \"famous writers on writing\" and lots of \"racism here, there, and everywhere.\" Each set had its strong and weak points, good reads and impenetrable prose, eye-opening perspectives and professional-victim dreck. Professor Grantham makes an impressive effort to work with each student (it's a small class--think five or six max) on an individual basis, at the level of writing skill he/she brings into the class. Weekly conferences in her office are part of the course requirements. Her comments on my essays could tend toward some goofy P.C. overcorrection, but there was also some sound style advice there now and then. I am ambivalent about how to rate this class, since I enjoyed the interesting discussions and close, personal atmosphere (Grantham will cook you dinner at the end!), but I don't believe it really helped me, or the other students, to write a whole lot better, which is what it advertised. Rather, it encouraged the kind of \"How I feel\" element that plagues so much of student writing to begin with. My recommendation is to take it if you are already a pretty good writer and just want some interesting discussions with a splendidly kind professor. But I wouldn't depend on this class to teach me essay-writing skills for the rest of Dartmouth. Also, this class is pass-fail, so there's no competition.\"",

You read a lot. And the books you read are tough. Antichrist, Immortality, Gospels, etc. You write a lot, and it's super hard to satisfy Prof.Gocsik. The class is more of a discussion on assigned reading, and she expects you to talk during class, so you gotta do the reading, otherwise you're screwed. Oh yea, also Prof.Gocsik thinks that we have too much free time at our disposal, that she will also give you a media project to be done by the end of the term. You need to make a documentary (5~6 min)on Dartmouth. It's bloody hard, but it's worth it, i think. I learned a lot. Besides, no exam, and you can revise your paper as many times as you want.\"",

She takes an individual approach to her students, never denigrating anyone, always conscious of differences, always searching for hidden spark.

He's a super interesting and knowledgeable lecturer and was very compassionate during a virtual term (he made two written assignments optional, including the final five-page paper). All of the assignments for the class were very painless: four (supposed to be five) 300 or 450 paragraphs and a three-page more creative assignment. Frequent usage of breakout rooms, which generally weren't bad because the people in the class are generally English majors and want to discuss the works.

I might be a little biased because I am an English major (and I never would have considered this course if it wasn't required), but everyone that I talked to in this class agreed that it is incredible. The readings can often be quite dense (untranslated Chaucer, etc.), and require that you devote 2-3 hours to do the readings before the class. Honestly, though, a lot of times I wouldn't do the readings or I would only do some of them, and I still felt like I got a lot out of this course (you usually end up reading relevant portions out loud in class, anyway). Prof. Beckman is super sweet and very clearly explains the central concepts of each piece of reading, so there isn't any confusion. Only workload, other than readings, are weekly discussion posts over the readings, which have very loose deadlines. There are two exams - midterm and final. For both of those, students submit questions, which comprise ~60% of the exam, and Prof. Beckman makes up the other ~40%. Both exams are very straight-forward, and as long as you sort of pay attention in class and take decent notes, you'll probably be just fine.\"",

Professor Beckman is a super fun professor who keeps discussion engaging and lively even in the windowless room that was often just a little bit too warm. The workload is pretty significant - as others mention, untranslated Chaucer is pretty tough to get through, and there is quite a bit of reading to do ahead of every single class. In addition, taking an English class with no essays was a little bit jarring. However, the discussion posts were flexible and the exams were quite straightforward if you studied enough for them. Take this class if you have any interest in an English major, minor, or even just for fun!\""
