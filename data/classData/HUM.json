He's clearly passionate about what he teaches, and weaves his own expertise (religion, evangelical history) into the lectures. Quizzes and discussion posts (weekly) and the two major papers of the term (one book review, one film review) were all manageable and interesting. Reading and writing for this class hardly felt like a burden because it was all so reasonable and well-curated. I learned a ton about the Sixties \u2014 Balmer focuses a lot on music, which none of my previous History professors had \u2014 and will definitely remember this course as a gem at Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with Randall Balmer: One of the most interesting and fun classes I have taken. It is a lecture class where each week covers a different year or two from the sixties. You get to learn about the culture and history surrounding the era. My favorite part was listening to the top songs of each year at the end of lectures. Grading is based on 8 quizzes (96 points total), 8 discussion posts (80 points total), the book review (read a book and write 5-7 pages on it) (90 points), and the pop culture review (watch a movie and write 3-5 pages) (40 points). Just come to class and take good notes and you will be fine on the quizzes as they are open note and taken on Canvas. For the papers, just make sure you include references to some of the readings and lecture materials from the class. I lost a couple of points for not doing that but you'll get an \"A\" either way. Overall, it is a great class to take over the summer.\"",

Professor Balmer is not only a great lecturer but also just such a sweet person; I have such a hard time waking up in the morning but I dragged myself out of bed every single Tuesday and Thursday because I genuinely enjoyed going to this class. As some of the other reviews mentioned, each week we learned about a different year in the 1960's (its history, politics, culture, sports, fashion, and popular media), and Balmer played the top songs from that year for us. He assigned some really cool articles and movies for homework, so it's worth it to get through the assigned material if you have time, but Balmer is also great about covering everything you need to know in class, so as long as you go and take notes you'll be all set for the short weekly quizzes. We also had weekly discussion posts, which were graded pretty leniently and didn't take much time to write, and a couple of essays (also graded leniently and not too long). I truly cannot speak highly enough of this class and Professor Balmer.\"",

It was frustrating to see students show up and take the quizzes then leave \u2014 he even gave an attendance quiz at the end of one class to try and combat this. He's an engaging lecturer and puts a ton of time + effort into making interesting classes. I really liked the readings \u2014 he assigned a reasonable amount and then we would usually have quizzes on them in class, so definitely read and take a few notes so you remember what they were on.

There are weekly pop quizzes but if you do the readings (which are arguably more interesting than his lectures) and come to class you will be fine. Sometimes he gives the quizzes at the end so you kinda have to stay for the whole thing, but the class is enjoyable and you basically watch videos and listen to music. He frequently lets class out early and there is no midterm or final, just 3 short papers.\"",

There's only three short essays throughout the term that you have a lot of freedom on. If you skim the reading every night, you'll get 100s on the quizzes. The essay prompts are so broad that you can write about pretty much anything and get an A on them. Balmer is also a super nice guy - get to know him! Especially if you sit towards the front and at least TRY to be engaged during class, he will like you. Lots of music in this class, some short videos, and history. When I think about it this is mostly a history class. Your notes will serve no purpose. Overall, definitely a layup and a pleasurable class to go to.\""

During hums 1, I could tell that most people in my discussion group had been used to being the number one students in high school. Suddenly, they found themselves surrounded by equally intelligent people-- and here lay the problem. To compensate for this, they tried to sound as smart as possible when they spoke, which only caused them to talk a lot while saying nothing. I think I can honestly say I learned nothing from discussion during hums 1. In Humanities 2, on the other hand, the people in my discussion group had gotten over the initial shock of being at Dartmouth. This made the discussions infinitely better, and I can recall many interesting ones that we had. In addition to this, Prof. Graver was excellent at guiding and moderating debates. She normally teaches in the classics department, so she was especially good when we were reading the Aeneid and Seneca's Phaedra. Unfortunately though, you can't control which prof's discussion section you'll be in. Just know that you are very lucky if you get Prof. Graver. As far as the assignments go, there was one 4-5 page paper and a final ten page research paper. My one complaint was that they gave us about a week to write the final paper, which sort of encroached on studying for other finals. Try to make sure your other classes aren't intense at the end as well; otherwise, you could end up in quite a crunch during the last few days of the term.\"",

There was also a ridiculous and unmanageable amount of reading.\"",

The readings were varied and ranged from the \"foundational texts\" (Genesis, the Aeneid, the Inferno) to more contemporary readings, which made the class more applicable to the present. The lectures were good (I particularly liked the ones by Professor Tarnowski, but both Professor Shookman and Brown also had interesting lectures; the combination of the 3 profs from 3 different departments provided a good variety of perspective and expertise). Overall, Humanities provided a great intro to \"the classics\" and was really interesting. Even though it was a fair amount of reading, it is definitely worth it!\"",

There is waaay more reading second term and at a faster pace. Keeping up is not totally necessary, but helpful, and it is quite a struggle. The books are worth it though.

Some of the best moments were having very involved discussions with classmates about them. Professor Brown, who led my discussions, often enjoyed micromanaging discussions by commenting, nodding, pointing, writing large words on the blackboard-- superfluous comments and literary commentary through pantomime. This made the discussions less that what they could have been. Furthermore, her commentary and criticism of student essays was often detail-oriented and picky. Admittedly, this helped me to improve my writing, but this can be done in ways that are a little less... self-important. Still. Some pretty cool stuff in these books.\"",

Your experience depends on which professor you have for your discussion group. First term, I found Saccio to be challenging and inspiring, but a bit too demanding. Second term, I was able to really get into the novels. I was happier with the works we read second term. I admit that I grumbled the whole way through first term and much of second term (aprox. 9 novels in 9 weeks is demanding!) but what other course offers you a survey of the greatest works of our time? I wasnt going to read the Inferno, Homer, Faulkner, and Goethe on my own! Once I was able to get a handle on the reading, I thoroughly enjoyed humanities.

The readings were very intriguing and represented a good sampling of the Western canon. I was disappointed by the class dicussions and lectures. The dicussions were redundant, and repetitive. Fellow students didn't have a good enough grasp of the reading materials, and Professor Shookman did not guide the discussion enough. The lectures were irrelevant and only inspired yawns. In fact, they seemed assembled at the last minute, and did not instill a sense of why the works we read are \"classics.\" Overall, the class did little to earn it's subtitle of \"The Classical Tradition.\"\"",

            "review 13: \"05W with Ellis Shookman: I am so so grateful I got into Humanities 1 & 2 for my seminar. Honestly, I can't imagine what my 1st 2 terms at Dartmouth would have been like without it. This is truly an excellent course. It gives you a great foundation in the classics of western civilization, but more importantly, it's taught by brilliant but nice and accessible professors, and the kids in the class are interesting, enthusiastic, & intelligent people. It's kind of a bizarre format for a seminar. Unlike other seminars, where you have class with the same professor and 15 other students every day, this course alternates between a lecture given by one of the three professors team teaching the course to all 60 students, and 20 student discussion sections, each led by 1 professor. 2/3 of your classes each term are discussion sections, and you keep the same professor & classmates the whole term, so the discussion sections really get a chance to bond. I liked the format a lot. Discussions and lectures were both interesting, and it was nice to have the variation in schedule. Some of the lectures, particularly Saccio's and Shookman's, were absolutely brilliant, and they were all informative & helped us understand the books better. And I learned at least as much in class discussions. It's really cool, when everybody actually likes the class and does the reading (as they did in this class), discussions are fascinating. Everyone looks at things from a slightly different angle, & sometimes you get into ridiculous debates over nerdy things like the moral (if there is one)of Bacchae, whether Werther is a hero or an antihero, & whether Aeneas really loved Dido. The professor you get for discussion section is really important to how much you like the course. I was lucky & got Shookman 1st term & Tarnowski second. (Unfortunately, no one gets Shookman for both.) Professor Shookman is the coolest professor ever, really soft spoken & unintimidating, but also brilliant & with a hilarious dry wit. He's an incredibly nice person, really cares about his students, & is extremely helpful during office hours.(a warning on his grading, though: the only thing he corrects is your grammar, but his final grades on papers definitely take content into account too.) His discussion sections are really cool, because he mostly just lets us talk. He'll steer the discussion & sometimes ask us to clarify comments, but it's mostly us discussing these works with each other. One day in the midst of a discussion on Phaedrus, we wandered completely off the topic of the book & onto philosophy, religion, science, & the meaning of life... Coolest class ever if you have Shookman. Professor Tarnowski is also an excellent professor. Her teaching style is very different from Shookman's & a little hard to adjust to if you get her right after, but she's also enthusiastic, nice, & really really smart. She doesn't let students discuss things amongst themselves as much; instead she replies to pretty much everyone with her own comments. She makes excellent points, but it's kind of nice just to be able to talk with each other, without having to worry about the teacher's evaluation of our points. She's a very fair but tough grader. She doesn't \"curve\" essays, & is very willing to give everyone bad grades if that's what we deserve. However, she's very lenient with extensions if you talk to her in advance, & she's extremely helpful (more helpful than Shookman, who never really commented on content) if you talk to her about your essay. Her grading may be a little bit hard, but her comments are always fair & accurate, & she's a really nice person, very willing to help anyone who goes to ask her questions, & very interesting to talk to. All in all, this is a wonderful class. You learn so much, meet some of the most interesting, intelligent kids in the class, & get excellent professors excited about the material they teach. There's a lot of reading & writing, but it's completely worth it!\"",

I think the Humanities program is the best thing you can do for yourself in your freshman year at Dartmouth: you learn to read a lot of material--quickly, at that--and what you're reading is some of the best stuff you'll read in college. Sometimes it's not really possible to entirely understand a work before you move onto the next one, but you never have any work besides reading the books and, occasionally, writing one of the three essays (which aren't graded very harshly). The professors are all very much into the material, and the discussions are intereresting. Youuuu should take the class.

That's really what I wanted from this course -- to read the greats. I think my writing improved a lot with Shookman. It's true that he is really concerned with grammar. At first, it felt like he was reading for that rather than for the point of an essay, but looking back, I think he was looking for content as well.

That being said, the class had its flaws as well. The professors had a very narrow view of what should be talked about in an english class like this. Instead of relating the books to their wider historical/philosophical/personal context, the professors were OVERLY concerned with keeping all discussion/paper writing \"inside the text,\" which I found baffling. No work of literature is an island, and I found it appalling that attempts to relate these books to larger, non-prototypical english class themes and philosophies were squashed. I brought up this point, only to be told that there wasn't adequate time in the D-plan to have these kind of discussions. In that case, this course, which has SO MUCH potential, could be made great by taking a few books out of the syllabus so that meaningful discussion could occur. Also, the weekly lectures were absolutely horrendous. They mostly consist of a wikipedia-esque summary of \"significant dates\" of whatever author, which is absolutely irrelevant to anything whatsoever.

Some of the books we read were excellent, while others were not enjoyable at all. In spite of this, I think the selection was good for helping us understand the whole idea of the \"Classical Tradition.\" The paper topics this term seemed overly restrictive and not terribly engaging. Professor Williamson seemed more concerned with composition and style than what we were actually trying to prove or interpret in the essay. Because of this, the rewrite opportunities seemed more like a chance to fix little mistakes and get a better grade rather than a chance to actually think about and develop your ideas and argument. While her feedback in conferences was helpful, I don't think it led me to a better understanding of the material. In spite of these rather meaningless assignments (including an identification section on the final that seemed far too random to actually measure our comprehension), I think I learned a great deal in our class discussions and had the opportunity to explore books I might not otherwise have read. It's definitely worth putting up the essays and taking the class simply for the opportunity to engage with and debate the readings.\"",

I was very impressed with her ability to provide insight into a topic or issue while acknowledging its complexity. She taught me to hate oversimplification.

The biggest weakness with the courses is the pair of porfessors who round out the teaching team. While I was lucky to have Professor Saccio as my discussion group leader during my first term, this last term I had to endure the rule of Professor Suzanne Brown. I'll leave it at that.

It may have scared me off from ever taking a class in the HUM department again, but that's just because sometimes I felt like people were giving me some intense bullsh*t during discussions (not really the professor, moreso my dearest peers). Overall, though, I feel like I learned how to write better within my own style of writing. The works we read were definitely cool, and you can always take the ones you don't like as much as a challenge to understand. If there's a reading or analysis that you judge pointless, just defy yourself to find meaning in it by yourself. I don't think that's something you can do in every writing class, so it made HUM002 really cool for me. There's also a lot of thought going into the choice of the works in the syllabus, and they're meant to connect in cool ways, and reflect the specialties of the professors teaching the sections. Edmondson was a very sweet lady. She's helpful, gives extensions and holds a good amount of office hours, and her grading is well explained (she's got a worksheet for grading!). She is very good at leading discussion as well, making sure to let people be heard, but also, offering her own insight when she judged it necessary. All the love for her. <3\"",

Her way of leading the discussion group felt very much engaging, and not at all judgmental or sterile (like some other section leaders). She is also genuinely an incredibly wholesome person, she grades reasonably, she is very good about extensions, she's always available for office hours, and crucially, she is always understanding about the fact that students have personal lives. But that's just one half of the equation, the other being the readings themselves. I must say, in this regard too, I much preferred HUM2 to HUM1. The works ranged from Montaigne and W.E.B. DuBois to Shakespeare and Milton, with some more obscure names and other artforms thrown in there - a great variety, but also very engaging works that really make you think about grand concepts through simple narratives. My excitement slightly petered off by the end of the term, as we moved into a more contemporary curriculum, but fortunately the classics still had their time to shine for the majority of the ten weeks. Overall, if Edmondson is involved and you see at least one or two books on the reading list that interest you, I highly recommend you take this class. It is certainly unconventional, but it's a whole lot more fun than any first-year seminar, that's for sure.\""

The Odyssey, Kafka, Austen), but the amount of reading per class was sometimes lengthy; as long as you pace yourself it shouldn't be a huge issue. The papers were not difficult, they got lengthier as you went along (3 in total), but that may be attributed to the fact that Rainer seemed to be an easier grader than some of the other profs.

I wasn't too big a fan of the works we looked at in class this term, with Milton's Paradise Lost and Montaigne being the most unpleasant, but you can get by pretty easily in the class if you pick your battles. Most of the discussion posts are able to be done with some quick skimming of the works and googling, if you don't want to read the full thing, and discussion in class you can play by ear and either comment on what someone else said, or pick up the gist of the work online and go off of that. For most of the class I would play minesweeper while listening passively to the discussion, then chime in when I thought of something to say. There are 3 essays throughout the entire course, which means you have to choose three works which you'll actually read and stick with, much more manageable than the 9 or so pieces of media that they assign you. Some of the works were fun, though, I particularly enjoyed Bruegel's Fall of the Rebel Angels, and A Portrait of a Lady on Fire. All in all, if you're comfortable in your writing skills, and have sufficient experience from high school in intelligently talking your way through seminar style classes without reading the book, this'll be a pretty light class. I didn't read about half of the books we spoke about and ended up with an A, and had fun talking in class. If you're looking for a deep rewarding course about literary analysis, HUM 2 also serves as that, depending on the amount of work you put in.\"",

I thought most of the works we read/watched were pretty good although the syllabus changes each year so be aware of what works they are offering in the future to decide if you want to take the course. The class is an easy A if you can write an essay because that's pretty much all you are graded one (2 five page essays and 1 ten page essay). I particularly enjoyed the museum visits to the hood we did periodically throughout the term where the curators at the hood made special exhibits just for our class which was very fun. Also if you take this class with McGillen, go to her office hours or take her to lunch and get to know her outside of class; she is truly one of the coolest profs I've met at Dartmouth and even if you don't need help with anything her office hours are a nice time to just sit and have a chat.

These, plus the final exam, constituted our grade. Professor Saccio was my discussion leader. This guy is a great teacher-- both in lectures and discussions-- first, because it's obvious that he lives and breathes literature, and second, because he's just very smart.

Saccio really listened to what everyone said in the discussion and responded with just criticism. He's also pretty funny, too. Professors Wine and Shookman too were good, though I saw them only in lectures. Shookman's lectures were very dense, but if you paid attention, it was all valuable. He too used humorous interludes to pretty good effect. (like humor that's relevant to the topic at hand... \"it's funny because you read the material\" funny).

He directed the discussion, but allowed us to talk about what we wanted to. He was honest about his own opinions of the material and acted as a clarifying force when our discussions got muddled. The workload is fairly heavy, but not undoable.

Then, after listening to our ideas for a while, he'd politely offer a short suggestion, which seemed to sparkle with clarity and depth. For example, after we discussed \"Death In Venice\" with minimal guidance for about half of one period, Shookman flipped through his book and asked us to stick our finger in and select a page at random, and said we'd talk about that passage. We did, and he then proceeded to rip the random passage apart, laying the literary devices, motifs, and their significance all bare. I may end up taking German classes, just to have a class with him again--he's that good. The course itself was great, though there were problems.

The poetry is also a waste of time because a grand total of 15 minutes is spent on each lyric poem.

            "review 41: \"01F with Peter C.: I didn't really know what to expect from this class for my first term here. I signed up for it because I always wanted to read the \"classics\" on the reading list, and it was a class completely different from my intended major. Turns out that I did better and learned more from this class that I did the other two classes I was taking for pre-reqs, and as a result, I am now contemplating going in another direction in school. I don't know if this really has to do with this class, but I think the topics discussed in here probably contributed to my new attitude. The class alternates betweens lecture days and discussion days. There are actually three teachers for the class, the other two being Prof. Ellis Shookman from the German Dept. and Prof. Margaret Graver from the Classics Dept. Each prof takes turns giving lectures, primarily with the works they are most comfortable with, and then when the class meets again, the profs act as discussion leaders for their section of the class (the whole class was about 60 students, so each section was about 20). In sections, you get to discuss the works more throughly and ask questions of both the prof and your classmates. I had Prof. Shookman for discussion, so that's why I couldn't answer some of the survey questions because they just didn't apply here. At first, the discussions intimidated the hell out of me, but fortunately, once you get past the \"whoa!-everybody-around-me-is-three times-smarter-than-me-what-I-am-doing-here\" kinda feeling, it starts becoming enjoyable and interesting. At least for me it did. This class takes a significant amount of self motivation and interest in order to enjoy it. Otherwise, I have a feeling it would go over some people's heads who just really don't care about it. As for the workload, the final was our only test we had to worry about. Instead, we had five, 4-5 page papers due throughout the term along with weekly one page responses on whatever work we reading. I heard a lot of people complain about the amount of writing, but I didn't think it was that bad. As a seminar class, there is a focus on writing, and I would have to say that my writing clearly improved throughout the term. Prof. Shookman would go through and correct everyone's papers individually and then would return them so everyone could turn in a revised version for grading. I thought this was outstanding, especially in junction with the times he was available for questions and advice on writing in his office hours. I'm not sure if Saccio or Graver did this as well, or if our section was just the lucky one. Yet, as I go on and on about how good the class was, there were some faults. One thing, it is able to get a decent grade in the class without going to the lectures. I didn't excercise this opportunity, however many of my friends did. I almost did after staying up until 2 one morning finishing the reading for lecture and then getting into class and having to sit through Prof. Graver ramble on about Yugoslavian oral tradition forever. I was not the only one who could care less about her lectures in particular. They often had nothing to do with the reading and seemed to pick out trivial points to expand on for the hour. Both Saccio and Shookman were also guilty of this on occasion. As I said before, the class does take some self-motivation. There are times when the ideas seem vague or the discussion loses focus and the profs don't define everything for you. This is when you have to look for the answers yourselves and interpret for yourself. I think this is actually a strength in a way, but if you aren't interested in spending the time to do it, I wouldn't recommend this class for you. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this class throughly as a freshman seminar. Compared to the horrific descriptions of other people's experiences with their own seminars (one girl was telling me she got stuck with a class on something like \"Food in the new world economy\"), I think was pretty lucky to be in here. I met a lot of great people in my discussion. It also helped to have three boys living on my floor, who happened to be in the class too, on those nights where we all run around looking for inspiration to write the night before a paper is due. We'll just see if I can say the same thing for next term after the sequel in \"Humanities 2\"...\""

I felt I received neither that grounding, nor an adequate understanding of the works that were read, nor even instruction that improved my composition. Instead, the class constituted merely a waste of time, and a constant nuisance, and though I received a very satisfactory grade at its conclusion, the experience was ultimately negative. The first discouraging facet of the course lay in the professors. All non-native speakers of English, and individuals whose speech was difficult to understand, these professors were nevertheless recruited to teach a course revolving around...yes, you guessed it, English Composition. Rota especially was incomprehensible, not only due to his thick accent, but also his roundabout manner of speaking, saying in 40 minutes what could have been stated in five, and mentioning little of substance. The lectures often provided one with little insight, and class discussions tended to be little better. Grading was usually arbitrary, at least with Alina Sokol, and if you hoped to do well with her, you had to toe the party line. In one especially piquant moment, she asserted that Dante's Inferno had absolutely nothing to do with religion. When not adhering to this opinion, essays on the Inferno were disembowled by Sokol herself. While the professors thus did much to sour the course, the curriculum itself also did not help matters. For instance, only modest excerpts of most works were read, and these excerpts were covered at such a pace as to make any in-depth look impossible. This was designed as truly a survey course, and even at that it failed. I got more insight about the books from the internet than from the actual class.\"",

You zip through the books so fast you barely have time to comprehend them (much less explore them at a non-superficial level), the lectures are usually dry and often do little to enlighten one on the book, and discussion sections usually serve as arenas where a few students attempt to impress the others with dazzling (or in most cases less-than-dazzling) philosophical comments. However, I did find that discussion sections allowed you to get to know other students (and my conversations with them about the texts outside of class were much more fascinating and in-depth than what is offered in class). The professors will be tough on your papers, but the grades are very reasonable. In retrospect, I do not regret taking the class, but as I was sitting through each class I could not wait for them to be over. The perks are definitely the high-quality professors and the spectacular reading list... unfortunately, neither are utilized to their full potential in this class. The best day of class was the plenary session on the last day where everyone picks their favorite quote from any of the books and reads it and explains why the quote has meaning to them. Sure, take the class. Over the course of the term, I managed to spend less and less time doing the reading and the writing for the course -- because you do so much of it that you are forced to improve those skills and get your work done faster.\"",
            "review 7: \"01F with Peter C.: I should start by saying that I had Professor Graver as my section leader. She was an obviously intelligent woman, but somewhat set in her ways. It took a lot of work to get her to agree with you, but it was possible. She was very demanding on her papers, and had little advice to offer spare her reccomending that we all purchase a writing manual of our own. Personally, it took my a while to get the swing of things, but once I did, the course became less demanding and more rewarding. Be prepared for a lot of reading, a lot of writing, and to figure things out own your own.\"",
            "review 8: \"01F with Peter C.: If you are prepared to do a lot of reading and writing, the Humanities seminar is very interesting. The readings, ranging from the Iliad to Thomas Mann, all brought a different voice to the class while continuing the same ideas throughout. Half of the class is spent in lecture with all the sections and the other half is with your discussion leader. The discussions were very helpful and make the course feel much smaller and more intimate. The course is a lot of reading and a good amount of writing, but I definitely feel that I've gained from it.\"",
            "review 9: \"01F with Peter C.: I didn't really know what to expect from this class for my first term here. I signed up for it because I always wanted to read the \"classics\" on the reading list, and it was a class completely different from my intended major. Turns out that I did better and learned more from this class that I did the other two classes I was taking for pre-reqs, and as a result, I am now contemplating going in another direction in school. I don't know if this really has to do with this class, but I think the topics discussed in here probably contributed to my new attitude. The class alternates betweens lecture days and discussion days. There are actually three teachers for the class, the other two being Prof. Ellis Shookman from the German Dept. and Prof. Margaret Graver from the Classics Dept. Each prof takes turns giving lectures, primarily with the works they are most comfortable with, and then when the class meets again, the profs act as discussion leaders for their section of the class (the whole class was about 60 students, so each section was about 20). In sections, you get to discuss the works more throughly and ask questions of both the prof and your classmates. I had Prof. Shookman for discussion, so that's why I couldn't answer some of the survey questions because they just didn't apply here. At first, the discussions intimidated the hell out of me, but fortunately, once you get past the \"whoa!-everybody-around-me-is-three times-smarter-than-me-what-I-am-doing-here\" kinda feeling, it starts becoming enjoyable and interesting. At least for me it did. This class takes a significant amount of self motivation and interest in order to enjoy it. Otherwise, I have a feeling it would go over some people's heads who just really don't care about it. As for the workload, the final was our only test we had to worry about. Instead, we had five, 4-5 page papers due throughout the term along with weekly one page responses on whatever work we reading. I heard a lot of people complain about the amount of writing, but I didn't think it was that bad. As a seminar class, there is a focus on writing, and I would have to say that my writing clearly improved throughout the term. Prof. Shookman would go through and correct everyone's papers individually and then would return them so everyone could turn in a revised version for grading. I thought this was outstanding, especially in junction with the times he was available for questions and advice on writing in his office hours. I'm not sure if Saccio or Graver did this as well, or if our section was just the lucky one. Yet, as I go on and on about how good the class was, there were some faults. One thing, it is able to get a decent grade in the class without going to the lectures. I didn't excercise this opportunity, however many of my friends did. I almost did after staying up until 2 one morning finishing the reading for lecture and then getting into class and having to sit through Prof. Graver ramble on about Yugoslavian oral tradition forever. I was not the only one who could care less about her lectures in particular. They often had nothing to do with the reading and seemed to pick out trivial points to expand on for the hour. Both Saccio and Shookman were also guilty of this on occasion. As I said before, the class does take some self-motivation. There are times when the ideas seem vague or the discussion loses focus and the profs don't define everything for you. This is when you have to look for the answers yourselves and interpret for yourself. I think this is actually a strength in a way, but if you aren't interested in spending the time to do it, I wouldn't recommend this class for you. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this class throughly as a freshman seminar. Compared to the horrific descriptions of other people's experiences with their own seminars (one girl was telling me she got stuck with a class on something like \"Food in the new world economy\"), I think was pretty lucky to be in here. I met a lot of great people in my discussion. It also helped to have three boys living on my floor, who happened to be in the class too, on those nights where we all run around looking for inspiration to write the night before a paper is due. We'll just see if I can say the same thing for next term after the sequel in \"Humanities 2\"...\"",
            "review 10: \"01F with Peter C.: I really enjoyed this course. It was a lot of work and sometimes I felt a little overwhelmed in Discussion groups. But overall it helped me to look for connections and important information when I read. I would recommend the course.\"",
            "review 11: \"01F with Peter C.: I simply thought this course was great. The lectures were inspiring; the materials interesting; the profs knowledgable, the discussions exciting; all this was clouded only by the difficulty of the writing assignments. This class is definitely difficult as far as English classes go, but I feel I am a better student for having taken it. Saccio is a captivating teacher and showed a genuine interest in helping the students. If you're willing to take on an interesting challenge I recomend taking humanities 1 for just that.\"",
            "review 12: \"01F with Peter C.: Sometimes I thought the title of this course shouldn't be \"The Classical Tradition,\" but rather \"The Meaning of Life in 60 Minutes or Less.\" This class was what I'd been waiting for my whole high school career. I wanted my professors once I got to college to be innovative, to be accessible, to be willing to tackle the tough stuff instead of beating around the bush. The lectures were wonderful--everything from amusing to astounding--and the discussion sessions were a genuine exchange of ideas from student to student as well as professor to student. If the purpose of this course was to make us more sensitive and more thoughtful human beings, I think it succeeded.\"",
            "review 13: \"01F with Peter C.: The class was not quite what I expected. Sacchio was a great lecturer, and the discussion sessions were great, but most of the lectures didn't seem to have that much necessary information. Also, this is an extrememly reading intensive course that takes up a lot of time outside of class. I wasn't that impressed by the course.\""

It's a good idea to do all the readings and attend the all the lectures (lecture once a week, discussion groups twice a week) before the midterm. After the midterm, all readings and lectures become severely optional. The lectures do not help you understand the readings. Discussions do. Antonia Syson is a fantastic woman.\"",

It was certainly a great choice for me to take this seminar, get 2 literature courses out of the way, and read lots of great books that I would want to read anyway. Also, the writing for this class is not very intensive, and only 3 papers are required all term. These three professors were all great as well.\"",
            "review 3: \"07F with Ulrike Rainer: The course looks great on paper, as you probably know from reading the ORC description. However, not much is done with the great works of fiction studied in the course. Every week, there are two seminar discussions with a discussion leader and one lecture with all of the seminar groups. The seminar groups are basically just people debating about the various merit/bad points of the book, without much input from the professor. Generally, they're not very interesting. The lectures are terrible. All the professors alternated and they usually just read from a paper they had written on the book, which was terribly boring. Also, they went to straight to analyzing the finer points of the book without going over basic principles. Overall an easy class with good reading material, but rather boring because of lectures/ unproductive seminars.\"",

Being forced to read books did indeed accomplish that, but I would have been better off reading them on my own. Lectures were pointless and rarely went beyond a basic historical context of the novels we read. Discussion was boring and uninspired--despite the class only being an hour long, I was always counting down the minutes waiting for it to end. In all honesty, I found Sparknotes more insightful than class. The papers are fairly easy and you can get away with not doing all of the reading, but it's still not worth signing up for. Take a more interesting first year seminar, even if it involves more work. I'm supposed to take this course next term because it's a two-term course, but I opted for a new first year seminar instead.\"",

Only 3 essays with the chance to revise the first two, Prof. Kopper was available to talk with about essay topics, etc. As long as you stay on top of readings and doing the essays on time you should be set. Sometimes lectures/discussions were a bit boring, some of the things brought up seemed to be pointless things to be discussing, but overall an interesting course that allows you to read and discuss classic pieces of literature.\"",

I took it because I wanted a solid Humanities foundation in literature, and I think it has given me that and therefore I am satisfied with it as a first year seminar. I think it showed me that I am not a huge literature fan, in that I was so immersed in such a density of literature all the time from this class that it jaded me quite a bit. I would suggest that you only take this course if you are sure you want to. I do think it is probably more useful than other seminars where your topic range is so specific and focused and not very helpful in more everyday situations. As for professors, I think it's pretty much a toss-up whether or not you get ones you like and have good experiences. That is unfortunate, but I was lucky :).\"",
            "review 8: \"07F with Ulrike Rainer: I like reading, but I admit, I struggled through the readings in the course...in that I had to read them in time. I failed to read most of the books in time for discussions--I barely read them before the essays were due. I'm a good student, but the readings were too much back-to-back-to-back, with no time for breathers. Most of the readings were interesting, but the task of finishing a whole book in a weekend is a daunting task. PLAN WISELY! Plus, the fact that the Classical Tradition is a two term class for both FALL AND WINTER, REALLY REALLLY REALLLLLLLLLY causes problems--decide wisely if this is what you want to do. It is inflexible, and you're stuck in a course...and it'll be too late. The essays are interesting to write about, although if you're not trained to write, can (and will) prove to be a challenge. The group lectures, on one hand, were the most ineffective, I felt. The background information proved to be dull and lifeless, and many people simply zoned out or used the time to catch up on their readings. I felt like they could have eliminated the big lecture hall type lecture.\"",
            "review 9: \"07F with Ulrike Rainer: This course is a good introduction to the \"great books,\" and not all the selections were rigidly canonical and boring. Works just off the beaten track of traditional literary courses (e.g. The Metamorphoses, Orlando) added valuable and interesting perspectives on the central theme of personal transformation. However, we also read over-analyzed warhorses like The Odyssey and The Metamorphosis. Unfortunately, the weekly/bi-weekly combined lecture sessions were sort of a waste of time. All three professors were insightful lecturers, but often fell back on cursory contextual presentations which could have been easily (and more engagingly) introduced in the smaller sections. I felt I learned more, and enjoyed the class more, in the discussion sections. Kopper, Rainer, and Syson were all great professors--informed, personable, and communicative. Professor Syson especially is an exceptional teacher with an obvious passion for academic discourse.\"",

However, the first half of the course is a fair amount of work because you start with reading the Iliad very quickly and then you basically read a book or two a week, and the mid-term requires some detailed memorization of plot points, characters, and quotes. The second half is much easier (the books are shorter and you just need to write a final paper). I had Brown for discussion section and she was good at eliciting interesting discussion and drawing answers out of you. (I don't remember much about the other profs).\"",

The class is three sections of 20 kids who all assemble once a week or so for lecture and the two profs (Graver in Classics? and Brown) who were not my prof gave some of the most boring off-topic clearly-of-interest-to-themselves-and-no-one-else lectures i have ever heard. It was like a different class. I think this was as a result of this class being interdisciplinary and not fitting into any one category. Prof Kop's lectures were whimsical and almost painfully wonderful, like when you get that extremely shy ten year old to sack up and play the kick ass violin concerto you know he can in front of people. He puts things very, very well. He was off-topic too, but no one minded because his lecture were good. In class he was depreciatingly funny and a great prof. who really cared about the material and really wanted us to...in a kind of 'please like this precious material that i love, please' kind of way that was both endearing and easily ignorable. Wow, i am a bad person. There was a lot of reading, and it really is expected that you do all of it. The midterm had extremely random stuff on it (like the date that Shakespeare's first folio was published) that i thought was unimportant so i didnt study and got a D and was pissed until i went to office hours and he said ver quietly that the reason dates are on there is that they really want the history to come alive for you and it's hard to do that if you don't realize that Shakespeare's England and Austin's are really as disparate as the dates profess, as Aeschylus's Greece differs from \"Homer's\". So I was like yeah good point. I learned a good amount in this course, mostly that my writing didn't suck as much as my bitter high school teachers said it did and I read a lot of books that I never would have read or understood had I tried out of a class.

Students were rewarded for writing simplistic papers that could be comprehended by a five year old. No attention was given to encouraging students to think complex thoughts in their papers or to developing their own unique writing style. The papers that were valued seemed predictable and homogenized. I am not saying this because I did not do well on the papers, only because I felt like I had to write not like myself for the class. I hope that I have not been influenced as a writer by this class. I felt like I had to sell out to a specific standard to get a good grade.

I was in Professor Brown's section, and I think that our class had pretty good discussions with her asking the pointed questions. Even though the lecture component was sometimes boring, I enjoyed them--all the profs obviously (to me, anyway) really knew their stuff and it made a nice break to just sit and listen sometimes instead of discussing. They didn't test us on the lecture material either; in fact, Brown told us not to dwell on something discussed at length in lecture in our papers. The papers were pretty tough, and are the reason I didn't take the second term. However, now that I've written them, I'm sort of proud of them. Brown schedules an hour to go over everyone's paper with them and gives you great feedback. She also lets you do rewrites for an additional grade. I'm not sure about the others, but I'm pretty sure they do too. I generally enjoyed the readings. I don't think they are really your standard classics list, but they are a pretty wide ranging group. The first half of the term was spent on the standard classics--we read Agamemnon, the Odyssey, and the Inferno, and wrote a paper on each. The next part was more interesting because the works were more recent and we got a break from papers. The only thing I really didn't like was Omeros, because I never knew what was going on. Damn vague epic poems.\"",

The course has two parts: the bulk are small group discussions, the quality and interest of which depend on a large extent on the prof (I found Brown excellent, but be wary of Kopper), and the other third are larger lectures, uniformly dull and pointless. The papers are tough, and what you write will get ripped apart by the prof - fortunately, Brown rarely gives lower than B's, but A's are nigh impossible to attain. Let's face it, this class is about the books, which you will have to read, no way around it, so if you're looking for a bit of a challenge and the list of titles appeals to you, go for it.\""

Having to submit a separate application for this course along with the general writing essay had me convinced that this class would be something very special, but it was just okay. I found 6-7/9 of the works we covered to be particularly interesting, but I feel as if we had no time to really appreciate any of them too well because of how rushed the class is. A typical week is reading around 40-80 pages per class, writing a reaction post, attending two discussion and a lecture, then moving onto another work. Then, every three weeks you would have to write a paper that became increasingly harder to do well on. Tarnowski is an extremely tough grader, and although she does provide feedback I felt as if I was making no progress as a writer. The discussion environments vary per each prof, but Tarnowski's felt very claustrophobic. Instead of a usual student discussion where the prof barely intervenes and it is the students doing most of the talking, Tarnowski would only let one student speak then bring the point back to what she had to say, and then try to redirect to people who have been raising their hands for thirty minutes. I would only recommend this class if you truly do have a passion (and time!) for reading, and if you are already a very talented writer. Don't take this class just for the prestige.\"",
            "review 2: \"22F with Andrea Tarnowski: I would seriously think about whether you want to take this course. Don't get me wrong: I loved the lineup of books that HUM 1 had, and I was really interested in the overall idea or theme of the course. But the theory of HUM 1 runs into numerous obstacles when put into practice. First off: many freshmen, myself included, forget that you have to buy your own books in college. This course had like 10 books; the prices WILL add up. Everyone rushes to Still North Bookstore at the start of the term to get them asap; if they run out, you have to order it on Amazon and get it sent to your Hinman box but that can take time. So just think about whether you can afford that or look into getting in some other way (library, online trial, etc.). The class generally had the following structure: Lecture at the beginning of the week (Monday); seminars\u2014discussing the book of the week\u2014during the other two times we would meet later in the week (in our case, Wednesday and Friday). But events, unexpected things like a day of caring can throw the carefully crafted schedule into disarray. You might end up with only one seminar on a book. The lectures were hit-or-miss\u2014most were bad or just all over the place. You basically read a book a week and then attend a \"meh\" lecture only to discuss it for like two seminars and then quickly move on to the next work. This tends to mean that you don't get to dive deep into the books you're reading; given the outstanding books we got to read, this was extremely disappointing. The seminars will vary a lot because of the professor leading the discussions; mine was Tarnowski and she had a tendency to speak for a bit too long while guiding the conversation in an overly structured manner (in my opinion). Freshmen will also be freshmen of course, so many people will try their best to impress (who? I don't know) and slightly turn it into a senseless competition that many others had wished to avoid in order to genuinely focus on the books. That freshman urge to be \"extra for the sake of competition\" or compete when there's no need is something a lot of people have carried over from high school; it will fade with their time at Dartmouth, so you hopefully only have to bear it for a bit. Do I regret taking HUM 1? I don't think so. At the end of the day, you get to read amazing books and you'll form little groups of friends that you can discuss them with. You write three papers and a discussion post for every book/movie, so the workload is not terribly burdensome. Keep both the good and the bad in mind and make your decision.\"",
            "review 3: \"22F with Andrea Tarnowski: I wouldn't recommend it. The readings were my favorite part. Like the other commenters said, the lectures most of the time didn't add all that much, and our discussions were static. Prof. Tarnowski spent most of the time sharing her own opinion\u2014and considering it fact\u2014instead of facilitating what I hoped would be an open discussion amongst the students. It felt often that we were all trying to impress her, rather than advancing the discussion in any meaningful way. Her grading was very harsh, and focused a disproportionate amount on writing style rather than the actual content of the papers themselves. Sometimes she would give feedback specific to a single word, and after you changed it to what she wanted, she would still take points off. This class was my least favorite of the three. I figured that because I had the opportunity to take it, I might as well, but I got very little out of the class.\"",

With 10 texts (8 books, 1 movie, 1 poem) in 10 weeks and only 2 hours and 10 minutes of discussion per week, we didn't get into any meaningful depth about anything. Also some of the lectures just didn't make sense at all and didn't add any meaning to the text whatsoever. My other complaint would be that the professors really didn't have an in-depth understanding of all of the material. They were reading some of these books for the first time when we did! Which is kind of frustrating because it means they can't offer as much insight into the text. Finally, this might be a hot take but I really did like Tarnowski, even though I wish she had let discussions kind of free-flow rather than facilitating them so closely.

Bringing together a bunch of students who love English, want to participate in class, and be taught by a dozen different professors is a great idea. The individual works were all interesting, but not enough time was given to understanding how they can be related to each other. The lectures were often so rudimentary that it barely added to high school level content or were just boring. Discussions were often interesting, but Professor Tarnowski never facilitated the open discussion everyone wanted: we always just raised our hands (which no one wanted). Comparative to a Writing 5 class, Hum 1 has more reading but much less writing: three short-medium length essays total and a weekly discussion post. Tarnowski is a fair grader but disproportionately focuses on style than on content. I understand that this class is in part supposed to improve writing ability, but this aim was never given significant discussion time in class. Overall a good class because of the works and the other students (compared to my experience with a writing seminar the following term), but not a layup because of the expectations for writing and the often extensive readings (the amount varied with each work each week).

            "review 2: \"22F with Colleen Boggs: This class is not nearly as bad as other posts make it out to be. It is a lot of reading, yes, but with the preface that the professors literally email you in July to start reading the texts over the Summer. I knew so many students who complained about the readings and then when I asked if they had followed the directions and started reading during the Summer, they said no. Either way, I found the readings to be quite fascinating. If you don't have time to finish a book then most of the time you can get away in discussion (what I ended up doing with one book I just didn't like). The course has two books of literary theory/not actually literature in Decolonizing the Mind and Civilization and Its Discontents which while very dry, were absolutely necessary for understanding the other texts on a deep level. Then the rest of the works were split between 3 novels, 1 movie, 1 poetry collection, 1 epic poem, and a short story collection??? (I'm not entirely sure how to classify The Decameron). Professor Boggs was pretty easily able to help us connect the all the works despite them often being written thousands of years apart which I thought was pretty cool. Boggs is super knowledgeable despite specializing in 19th century literature so even when we were discussing something like The Oddessey she always had deep insights on the text. One thing I wish Boggs did better with was provide more support along the writing process because while the first essay goes through a draft process, she really pulls back during the second and third papers which made it hard to know if you were even writing a good paper to begin with. Still, Boggs is not a harsh grader; I turned in some wacky shit and still got A-'s and A's. Definitely take this class if you like literature or writing or just having a good discussion.\"",

It will help you become more observant while you read and will make you a better writer overall, which will definitely help in other classes.

Happily, the selection of works is (mostly) classic, so you can certainly expect an incredibly enjoyable and illuminating reading experience. The lectures were fairly hit-and-miss; some of the lecturers were clearly very knowledgeable and engaging, while others seemed blatantly unprepared and seemed to ramble aimlessly about loosely connected quasi-intellectual topics. The discussion groups, similarly, offered a lot of insight some of the time, whereas other times they were incredibly awkward. For one, Prof Boggs is not only incredibly knowledgeable, but also a very pleasant person; you can really tell she's listening to each and every contribution to the conversation, while also adding to it and using it to steer the discussion. However, this can also feel a little bit more like a session in Parliament rather than a book discussion, as it sometimes feels quite restrictive. It doesn't help that, oftentimes, the people in the discussion group don't seem to have been educated in how to articulate their thoughts properly during high school, so it often has a habit of turning into a bit of rambling (~90% of the time about race or gender), which makes the proceedings slightly awkward some of the time. However, as hit-and-miss as the rest of the course is, the thing that really shines in this course are the books themselves. As cliche'd as it may sound, reading these great authors really does make you into a better, more well-rounded human being, and as such, I wholeheartedly recommend you take this course.\""

The course has 1 lecture and 2 seminars per week, and participation starts at a B for all students (how participation is graded is probably my least favorite part of the course, because you never know how you're actually doing). The course is a little more superficial than I would like, but that is the nature of a 10-week quarter and having to read and analyze so many works. HUM1 was incredibly Western-focused, as well, so no philosophical ideas from the East were introduced. I would recommend HUM to students who 1) enjoy fictional reading, 2) enjoy applying the fictional reading into argumentative essays and discussions/ arguing about philosophical ideas, and 3) understand the limitations of this course, in that it is more of a shallow survey-style class than an in-depth review.\"",

There were also weekly reaction posts on canvas of a couple paragraphs but Professor Singh along with most other profs graded them for completion. The essays were not graded generously but the lowest grade the prof would give was a B-.

That said, I was not particularly enamored with the greco-roman classics either, but I don't regret reading anything in this course. It really all boils down to what professor you are assigned for discussion section. Some, like Chaudhuri, are not as great at facilitating discussion between the students themselves (rather than with just him), but others I've heard have great discussions, so it all depends. You will, however, be guaranteed a group of peers in the class who really care about doing well and that rubs off - apathy is something that doesn't carry well in a class like Humanities 1/2. Professor: Professor Chaudhuri loves to tear apart papers. He admitted it himself. It took a couple times, but I think eventually most people in our discussion section were hardened to his criticism. In person, during office hours, he's markedly different, much... nicer, and he's usually fair in his grading - his expectations are very high and A's are scarce, but he'll reward improvement when he sees it. Workload: It's a lot of reading, and getting ahead on weekends and such is definitely advisable. Also, they give out pop quizzes on the lectures, so make sure to study those before every discussion section, especially key words like Greek terms, names of writers and works of art mentioned in lecture, etc. The papers are pretty spaced out though, so there is plenty of time to go to RWIT and talk it through with them once or twice or even thrice.\""
