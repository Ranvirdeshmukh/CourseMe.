If you do not appreciate the Arch 1 class you are simply unwilling to approach the subject in a manner different from what you expected. That, or you just suck at art and therefore should not become an architect. Take your pick. If you think that you have some sort of architectural talent you must stop. Just stop. You and I do not know anything, so get used to people making you feel that way. While you are at it, get rid of all other preconceived notions of what you believe architecture is before entering the studio. There are no doors, walls, or spiral staricases in design and do not get angry at the professor for telling you so. Oh, and if you only plan on spending fifteen hours a week on projects, do not even bother attempting the course. There is no time for sleep if you want to do well. There should be a prerequisite listed in the course description only allowing perfectionists to register.

This class has a great blend of exposing you to new techniques while still giving you the freedom to go deeper into whichever ones interest you most, and it consists of 5 projects; a drypoint, hard ground, soft ground, and aquatint print plus a final series of your choice. Due dates were always reasonable and flexible depending on the progress made during class periods, and although things can get pretty time consuming, it's really cool work so I always looked forward to my studio time and never felt like I was procrastinating or falling behind. Around weeks 5/6 everyone also had to give short 5-10 minute presentations on a particular printmaker, and throughout the term we had a few Hood museum visits and one workshop in the Book Arts studio. Jen is super approachable and she's always happy to give thoughtful feedback on your prints or assistance if you're having trouble getting started with a new technique. And, as someone who isn't a Studio Arts major and doesn't have much formal training in other art forms, I really appreciated how Jen still gave me the same attention and respect she did to my classmates who had more experience. The studio feels a bit overwhelming at the start, but it's incredible how comfortable you end up with it at the end when you know your way around and how to make your ideas come to fruition. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Dartmouth, so even if you're just curious about printmaking definitely give it a try with Jen!\""

Painting is definitely a little tricky because most people are not used to deal with oil paint, it also takes time to mix colors/find colors. It's way more time consuming than drawing, just because with drawing I could go to the studio right away, while with painting I had to change (it's good to have clothes to use only at the studio because they definitely get dirty with paint), open all paint containers, then mix colors, put on gloves. Let aside the fact we need to prepare the paper with gesso, wait for it to dry. Anyway, it's more work. Don't take it with two other time consuming classes because it will not be pretty. Leaving that aside, you do learn a lot in class and by the end of it I felt I was looking at art in a very different way. Riley definitely is more into abstract art, which is interesting but if you're not so much into it he will push you a little bit. Some weeks were very busy with assignments, and I felt they were not so well spaced. We would have like 2 paintings due one Tuesday and then no homework for Thursday, which is a bit annoying.

We learned how to build and stretch canvasses and we painted on three different types of material. Professor Randall explained concepts clearly and provided many examples - photocopies of paintings and books. She also did demonstrations in class when necessary. We didn't paint much from still lifes or models, which was a good thing because we all were still getting acquainted with oil paints. We also had less group critiques than in upper level classes, but I think that also contributed positively to the class. We painted a lot and Professor Randall gave us constructive feedback. We also attended some lectures and visited with the Artist-in-Residence in the Jaffe-Friede Gallery. This is a fun class, but you definitely should not consider it an 'easy third.'

That basically left me pretty bitter about the class, since I had only taken it out of interest and not out of necessity. Aside from that, however, I would recommend the class to anyone who enjoys drawing. The way that the prof gets you to think about how you see and what you see and the space where things are located is definitely worth it.\"",

That kind of drawing really has no place beyond the first several weeks in this class. Expect many self-portraits and sculptural projects.

Unfortunately that was not what the class was, and that was the reason for my dissatisfaction. We had a model at most 60% of class periods and most of our homework was only loosely figurative. By the end of the course, I really liked Prof. Park as a professor and I thought she brought an interesting perspective - just not for this class. It would have been a really interesting advanced drawing class, but I don't think I really improved at drawing the figure, and that was the biggest reason I took the class!\"",

This is not to say that this is not a worthwhile class; in fact, I think it offers many things that other studio art classes at Dartmouth do not (a focus on more conceptual art, for instance, or the opportunity to work with mixed media). All in all, I would recommend this class: Park is both very knowledgeable and compassionate, and the material is interesting. Just don't expect to be drawing models all the time.\""

He disappeared into his office for most of the class period. He didn't even look at your work in class. He offered no advice on technique. He was every art major's worst nightmare. Some students I don't think minded a lot because they took the course for fun, and since he assigned very little work, the course didn't cause much stress for anyone. On the otherhand, I think his lack of teaching abilities is a great disservice to art majors. We are here to learn how to be good at what we are doing. If we wanted to draw without instruction, we can do that without costly tuition. But we are here to learn skills, and I can honestly say that I learned nothing from this professor. The growing I did as an artist came from spending money I don't have on instructional books that were far more informative in their introductions than Prof. Ferrara was in his entire term at Dartmouth.

For us, the syllabus comprised of six pieces, four of which involved specific materials (including plaster, wood, and a found object), and all of which had a specific thematic guideline (e.g. \"tension\"). Six brief homework assignments prepare you for your work. Six or seven classes are devoted to critiques and the rest are free work days or demonstrations on plaster and woodworking. Therefore, the majority of the work is done outside of class. Professor: Professor Park's knowledge and experience are immediately evident. She is a kind person and engages each student personally. She gives constructive criticism when it is helpful and gives praise when it is earned. Her enthusiasm for art is infectious. Worth taking? If you are willing to devote TIME and ENERGY into this course, it is EXTREMELY rewarding. This is a course in which you will learn and grow more than the ORC description alludes to.

She has very big expectations from the students, and she will be convinced, despite all proof, that you are not living up to them.

There were lectures some days of class, talking about other art, but other class days were just work days. Besides the three main projects, there were a few other little things that just took up time too. There was also a single page paper due near the end of term about any art you go see in person, which was not a difficult assignment. The final project also includes a written component. William was helpful in figuring out how to complete a vision and was realistic about materiality, but he was not flexible with deadlines for any circumstances. The TA and shop tech were both fantastic and super helpful during monitor hours to get work done. The most challenging part of this class was time - especially on projects that need the woodshop, there were very specific hours that that was available, which was challenging to line up a schedule to do that.

I feel like the things I learned about shape, color, texture, whatnot, were 99% from my own experimentation, and very little was actually from her input. Maybe that's the way this is all supposed to work, I don't know. I had zero experience with any type of sculpture before I took this class, and I felt that it was kind of silly to expect us to produce these complete pieces and explain them right off. I think I might have learned more given more space to experiment and find out what things worked, what didn't, and then LATER use that knowledge to create something of more substance, rather than rush through it blindly, with the expectation of producing all these pieces that solve their respective problems AND stand on their own. It's an important class to take, I think that sculpture can be a lot more intuitive than a lot of other mediums, but also vulnerable to more b.s. Mostly yr making something, rather than making a representation of something. But the \"is it/isn't it art?\" issue seems a lot more shaky in sculpture precisely because it all is so abstract and out there. anyhow. I learned a lot regardless, about myself, myself as an artist, and about 3 dimensional art-making. i highly recommend the course, it makes you see the world differently, in a good way. especially if you've never been any good at drawing but do have some un-tapped ability at using yr hands or a quirky sensibility.\""

In Riley's class, we did many still life studies of contour, value, positive and negative space, did some drawing from a model, practiced capturing the emotion of a human face, learned to draw draperies, did an enlargement of a Rembrandt, and even had some free assignments. I have never had so much fun in a class. I was passionate about art to begin with, but I feel this class really allowed me to express myself and to develop my skills with charcoal and other medium. I feel I got better at representing the human figure, and I enjoyed myself while doing so. Other sections focused a lot on collage techniques and plants, but I feel we focused on topics relevant to the typical sort of art I would be interested in pursuing.

            "review 15: \"03F with Susan Walp: Professor Susan Walp's Drawing I was a really fabulous course. Every week we had a different subject that taught a different skill. The course was clearly very carefully planned and the skills we acquired each week were useful in the next week's assignment. Although the first week was a bit boring (drawing cardboard boxes) the assignments got more interesting quickly (greek sculpture, drapery, still life, hands and feet, bones, each other's faces, nude models...). We learned to use several different media (pencil, several kinds of charcoal, pen and ink, eraser as a drawing tool). Watching my work and that of my classmates progress was amazing because we all improved remarkably. I had thought that drawing was largely a talent you either had at birth or didn't, but this class showed me that drawing can definitely be taught. This was really a rewarding class. I came away with several pieces worthy of inclusion in a portfolio and a few pieces worth framing. The one thing to watch out for is attendance -- if you are one second late you are screwed and Walp will crucify you. You can't miss any classes and you can't be late. Attendence is really important, she's crazy about it.\"",

Prof. Hamlin, while often talkative and sometimes hard to reach, gave a lot of productive insight into our artwork.

Some of the homeworks were boring, but the effort I put in made them worthwhile. Students should be pre-warned --- when the professor suggests 10 hours a week of out-of-class time are necessary, it is not an understatement. I spent at least that amount each week, up to 12 hours on one assignment. But it is possible to fit it in with your other classes.

I thought he was an absolutley amazing teacher. His teaching style is not overly involved--but for an art class, i think that is REALLY good. he really steps back and lets his students take off in their own, natural direction--and he allows for a lot of different styles to be successful. he doesnt give lectures on perspective, and we dont do nude models--instead, at the beginning of each class he hands out a \"problem\" that we are to draw for the period (matches, leaves, etc). its really quite fascinating, bc as he says, the problem that is handed out really just becomes a vehicle for the drawing itself--the work ceases to be about the object (ie, if everyone were drawing the same still life for perspective, the drawing would be about accuracy). during class, he walks around and sticks drawings up on the wall that he wants to highlight; at the end of class, he gives a commentary on them, pointing out what he likes. i think we all learned a lot just by being able to see each OTHERS work--and by the end, it was so apparent how much we had all learned. i remember reading the reviews for him and some people saying that he goes over class--he does, by about 10 minutes. but by the same token, he didnt give anyone a problem who had to go--youd just pack up and leave. i feel like he might come across as somewhat cold to some people, but if you make the slightest attempt at all to talk to him your efforts are completely reciprocated. plus, he lets us listen to music in class. at the end of his drawing course, i feeel like i have a confidence in my ability--in a large part due to the free structute of the class. and i am not an art major--i am doing econ. soooo id reccomend drawing 1 WITH MOSS to anyone. and on the most basic level, there is no midterm, and a final critique which goes 45 minutes--i wasnt complaining. homework is 5 drawings, due every tuesday--not a huge time commitment (unlike other drawing 1 classes). take it!!! : )\"",

The course itself is presented, both in the ORC and by the Professor at the start of the year, as a very informal, introductory course for people INTERESTED in Studio Art. The Professor repeatedly talked about how getting an 'A' in this subject is not important nor hard, as the grade is awarded on the Professor's assessment of improvement and creativity. Given this sort of statement, I thought I did well enough. I attended all classes, as well as regularly complete the homework. But I was given a B at the end of the course - which isn't too low, but I was disappointed. As a student who is not a Stuio Art Major and cares about my GPA, if I knew I'd get a B, I probably would not have taken this subject. This strongly discourages others to 'try out' this subject, for fear or lowering their GPA. Besides this, I am happy with what I have done in this course and the skills I learnt.

Ben is EXTREMELY supportive and takes a special interest in his students. He makes you want to improve and to succeed. His teaching style is different from the other prof's, but I think this is beneficial. We didn't draw for the two first class periods, every period after that was devoted to drawing and critiquing only, there was no final project but there was a final crit, and subjects were very simple: feather, brush, string, noodles, paper bag, plastic silverwear, vegetable, clothing, etc. Other profs start their students on full still life setups the first day, and give lectures on \"how to\" every period. Ben lets you discover \"how to\" and through picking somewhat boring subjects, he forces you to experiment with the medium.

He considers subjects \"just an excuse to make you draw.\") Take this course, regardless of the major!\"",

He kind of just lets you go and there is no formal teaching. That is okay though because you sort of pick it up from the other students who do have experience. If you want to know the rules of drawing, this class isn't for you, but if you want to just have some motivation to draw something and finish it, then take it. That is the best thing I got out of it: I learned to just draw, to just sit down and draw it because you have to turn in something. If you have no experience whatsoever it will be intimidating at first, very intimidating and kind of scary, but stick with it if you have always wanted to be able to draw, you might surpise yourself. and from what I hear the other profs aren't much better, so if you get Prof. Moss consider yourself very lucky.\"",

Second she held no office hours so you had really no idea how you were going to do in the class until you get your grade. Her lectures were really arbitrary and poorly worded, leaving the class often confused of her intentions. However, her assignments did not take too long, probably b/c she didn't want to come in out of class to grade the hw and graded them all in class. the only bad thing is that you will probably get an A- no matter how much effort you put into the class (as long as you show up and hand in your hw). so don't strive too hard for the A since you will probably won't get it. Probably no one person in our class got a bad grade, except Hannah Chase who missed almost every class and blatantly attempted to kiss Kahn's butt on the few days near the end of the term that she decided to come. very funny actually.

As someone who was a complete beginner I do wish there was more instruction and drawing in class. Drawings were assigned around themes (light/shadow, portrait, perspective, etc.) on due Tuesdays and Thursdays and first hour+ of class time was spent discussing other people's work. People were so nice and you lowkey grow to appreciate everyone's style, which was awesome. The second half of class time was usually a pretty boring slideshow of artists the prof loves centered around the next assignment's themes. The class was definitely front-loaded; when we started nude model drawing in-class ~week 6/7 we didn't have assignments which was a breath of fresh air. Overall, if you like having freedom of doing whatever you want and not necessarily learning all the technical details, you'll love this class.

Honestly though, you don't learn how to draw or go over any type of \"this is how you do...\". Only negative thing I have to say is that class can get boring: you spend half the class looking at/commenting on your classmates drawing (which can hurt a little when no one has any compliments, but the prof will always find something positive to say) and then the other half going over a powerpoint which would be photos of famous drawings.

Prof. Dalseth is pretty clear about what he likes and doesn't like, so if you don't take constructive criticism well, avoid this course.

He won't shy away from embarassing you in front of the entire class either. Although during critiques, he opens the discussion to the whole class, any time anyone says anything, he will either completely negate what you said or just plain cut you off and say that you're wrong. He gave readings about how to properly use art terms, but if you do not completely understand the terms, don't bother using them because he will call you out and embarass you. Also, he tells you to use the readings to help you develop your artistic skills and use what you learn in the readings in your work; but then when you do use them, he'll tell you not to because \"there is no formula that you can follow to create good art.\" Also, he gave crazy amounts of homework and crazy assignments in general (i.e. go out into the woods at night and do three drawings). He also wants you to spend LOTS of time on these assignments, so if you have a heavy class schedule, you might want to think twice before taking this class. If you're interested in learning how to draw better, do not take this class. He doesn't care if you can draw well or if you have some artistic skill, he is looking more for creativity, which may not be everyone's goal in taking this class.

He never once drew or taught anything himself, instead relying on photocopying from whatever arbitrary \"drawing\" books he found and having us read the compiled packets. I repeat: HE DREW ZERO TIMES DURING THE TERM. During class he played loud, distracting music that made it hard to focus on our drawing. He had us buy a book for the class and we never once used it or brought it in. He never graded anything. When a concerned student asked about their grade he said something like \"what does a grade matter? just focus on creating.\" The first and only grade we ever got was the final grade we received in the mail after the term had ended.

I was not expecting that. we always had to hang up the assignments we did for homework and I would be downright ashamed. also I felt like Prof. Lauer would look at my drawings and assume that since they were pretty bad, I must not have spent very much time on them, but I always did! her weekend assignments were rough...3 drawings in a weekend. it doesn't sound like much, but I definitely underestimated how much work a studio art class could be. then once we hung up our drawings the professor would talk to each of us about what we did. she had constructive criticism to offer, but it was more about the feeling of the drawing, not the technique or how you could improve. there was a point in the middle of the term when it felt like we were all trying to please her. and since the standards of \"good\" and \"bad\" are so arbitrary in art, this was very frustrating. in the end I found that I was able to draw much better than when I started out...but everything I learned was by trial and error, not from the class itself. so basically you're paying for a term of drawing 1, but all you're getting is drawing materials and the obligation to draw for ~15 hours/wk. but whatever, it's over, I got my ART distrib, I'm happy.\"",

Before class he asks to see everyone's work so you have to do some work, but I don't think he has very high expectations for the qualities of the work [or can't... since I doubt he's allowed to grade based on the artistic talent of the student.] You do a LOT of still lifes pretty much until the last two or three weeks where nude models start coming into class sessions. If you are uncomfortable with those, you are allowed to ask for alternatives... but I would advise going to these sessions, as ppl are far more interesting to draw than apples, jars, etc. Pretty much it all depends on how much effort/time/interest you put into this class.

            "review 1: \"09W with Paul Bowen: I really enjoyed this class. It wasn't too much work, and the assignments and drawings we did in class were fun. Professor Bowen really tried to mix things up, and it worked well; we went on a few field trips to draw or look at drawings and that was interesting. Drawing I is known to be a really time-consuming class, but we only had assignments every Thursday due Tuesday, and we didn't even have a final project. Professor Bowen gave us a lot of freedom in our assignments, so we all came up with very different approaches. The individual critiques at midterms and at the end of the term were very informative to. Overall, a fun class.\"",
            "review 2: \"09W with Paul Bowen: I am an ENGS major with pre-med, so I guess I am used to classes that require a lot of work. But really, this class was the best third class ever because it required very little work but was still extremely interesting and worthwhile. Prof. Bowen was a temporary professor and I hope they hire him again, because he is very enthusiastic about art and his students. He did not assign us ANY homework between Tuesdays and Thursdays, which was awesome. Between Thursdays and Tuesdays, he would give us an assignment, which would be a topic such as \"Light and Dark\" or \"Paper Bag.\" These would be very open-ended, so it was always interesting to see what people came up with. I had a little bit of trouble figuring out what he liked at first, but I eventually figured it out, and had a great time. During one week, I spent a total of 45 minutes on the homework because I had been busy with my other classes, and that was totally OK. In the final week, I stepped up my drawing to 10 hours in that week, but we had no final project, so it was really nice to not have to spend 24 hours on a final project. I had never taken an art class before, although I have always drawn on my own. If you are worried about your level of drawing talent, be assured that Prof. Bowen is less interested in your drawing talent that your artistic vision--i.e., how you place objects in the picture, and so forth. You don't need to be able to make a photorealistic drawing of a crumpled piece of paper or an acorn, as I have heard is required in other classes.\""

            "review 1: \"20W with Lucy Mink Covello: Prof Mink is GREAT. The projects were very manageable and nearly all of them could be done during class, requiring very little studio time. She also didn't assign a lot of projects and the class was definitely just a participation and attendance based grade. She never really collected actual pieces, we would just hang them on the wall. The midterm was an optional meeting with her which never actually happened. The final project was three pretty self-interpretive drawings, very doable, and a thirty minute meeting to talk to her about your drawings. Definitely a layup with Prof Mink.\"",
            "review 2: \"19F with Lucy Mink Covello: I would only recommend Drawing 1 with Lucy if you're taking it as a throwaway or distrib. Her assignments weren't very interesting or challenging, and she offered very little in the form of technical instruction. She also didn't assign half as much work as Riley or Wilson, and didn't require a sketchbook, so it was definitely super easy in terms of time commitment. If you're looking for a low commitment drawing class, this is it. But if you want to actually improve, or are coming in with any experience at all, I would try literally any other professor.\""

            "review 2: \"05W with Thomas Ferrara: Drawing can take up all of your time but Ferrara was good about not overloading us with work. He is pretty spacey and likes art to be an expression of your feelings, an outlet -- his main objective is to get you to see art that way. He doesn't really care whether you are good at it or not. He's much more relaxed then the other profs and much less work. He gave little direction but had us study line, still life, creative composition, and figures. I actually really liked the class and I was pretty bad at it.\""

            "review 1: \"09F with Soo Young: Park has a fantastic ability to really connect with her students-I felt that she was really invested in our success, and that she truly wanted us to become better artists. I know I did-my only previous drawing experience before this class was a class in second grade on how to draw a turtle-so at the beginning of this class, I could draw fantastic turtles, but not too much else. Now I really feel that I can express what my words can not through a visual medium-and any visual medium, too. People who want to take photography or architecture might look at this class and think \"This doesn't make sense! The whole reason I take photographs/use a computer design program is to avoid drawing!\" But it's really infinitely helped my creativity-she encourages you to think outside the boxes of convention, and even outside the dimensions of the paper if she's on her game. Also, no matter how talented you are to start with, she can always find something to criticize about you work to help you improve even further. If one thing was changed about this though, I wish that she put a little less emphasis on abstract art, which is what she does(sculpture) and a little more on the technical aspects of drawing. Also, she's a little scatterbrained. Part of being the crazy artist, I guess! She is not easy in any way, shape or form-she told us at the beginning of the term that she assesses our progress against all of the students she has ever taught, and that \"A C is average\". Scary! But you'll do fine. Take this!\""

You have to show you're trying, but honestly if you don't you're wasting an amazing opportunity. Best art professor I've ever had. Generally two to four hours of work between each class, but occasionally you'll get the time off. No x-hours. Had a different class with Sunny, and it's really not worth taking classes with her.\""

        "Ginger Levant": [
            "review 1: \"17X with Ginger Levant: Overall this class was less work than most of the other reviews claimed it to be. Professor Levant gave us a drawing per week, taking 2.5 hours per week for the first two weeks. For week 3 and 4 we had basically no HW. After that the work picked up, reaching 10-15 hours in the last two weeks. I would not recommend taking this class unless you are a fairly good drawer or are willing to work your ass off. Their are only two ways to get a high grade in this class: artistic talent or extreme effort. If you're talented then (at least our) Professor will like your drawings and you won't have to work too hard. If you're not talented but you put in an extreme amount of effort -- show up to all x-hours, office hours, and work after every lecture and do 15+ hours drawing per week, you can get a high grade without excellent drawings. Maybe there is a middle ground - I don't know my grade yet :)\""
