There were 2-3 readings a week where you had to post a discussion question, 4 labs (took place in class), two short papers, and then a final project where you made your own fermented beverage along with a final paper. Monday's class was a lecture, Wednesday discussion on the readings, and Friday were labs/trip to Hood. The workload wasn't a lot, but not exactly knowing what to do made it more stressful. The labs often included identifying plant seeds/bones which was cool to look at, but hard to do successfully and you got points off if it wasn't right.

Each class was basically a session of group polarization where everyone's views grew more liberal, and while I do agree with much of what was said, I feel as though I don't have a complete understanding of alternative viewpoints or counterpoints to the more fluid understandings of race, sex, sexuality, and gender that I learned about in this class. Even if those alternative viewpoints are to be frowned upon or cast aside, at the very least, I think it's important to consider them and understand how best to respond to them. We did read some material that was in opposition to what we all expressed as our views in class, but everyone basically scoffed at the alternatives in favor of the majority view. But beyond that, if you're reading this review on Layup List, you're probably just wondering if the class is easy\u2014and it certainly is. It's basically just short reading responses for each class, three two-page essays, and a few in-class activities, capped off with a frustratingly vague and disorganized final project where you create a podcast based on a class discussion you led earlier in the term.

Otherwise, you have 4 short (2-3 page) papers, and the rest is all discussion in class. This course taught me so much. It's about the intersections between genetics and social issues. The first half of the course is about race, then you move into sex/gender/sexuality, monogamy, violence, and touch on incarceration. This was my first anthro class, and it really opened my eyes. Prof. Smith is such a nice man, and is a lot of fun. He really appreciates students' input, and had every student lead discussion at some point. He's a VERY easy grader as well. Your final project is a presentation on a topic of your choosing - really manageable during the finals frenzy. My only criticism of this class is that its students are a self-selecting audience, so you only get ulta-progressive viewpoints in the class. I wish Prof. Smith had pushed back a little or played devil's advocate so that we could engage with some material more vigorously and figured out how to defend the ideas we learned about to an audience who didn't always agree with it.

The readings were pretty fascinating -- a complex interplay of linguistics, biological anthropology, comparative anthropology/primatology, etc., etc. A lot of them were dense and complex, but never truly beyond comprehensible grasp. This isn't Dobson's precise field of expertise, but he knows a lot, and was able to help guide discussions very effectively. There's very broad opportunity to make your voice heard and propose your ideas, and since he grades heavily on participation, this class is best for people who have something to say. Your final paper is very open subject-wise, basically on any topic of your choosing relating to origins of language. Overall, it's a really interesting course, not very hard on the whole, and Dobson is a very cool, chill, easygoing guy. No reason not to take this.\"",

The readings were interesting, the discussions were very engaging, and there was very little work- just readings for each class (sometimes a lot of reading, but it was a 3A so there was plenty of time between classes to get it done) and a 10-15 page final paper, in addition to leading the discussion one of the times.

That said, this class meets on Tuesday afternoons for 90-110 mins and Thurs afternoons for about an hour, so a fair bit of Zoom time. More importantly, it is a massive amount of work outside of class. Every week, there is a response paper based on three dense, academic archaeology articles (mine ended up being 4-5 pages each time and we had nine in total) and a lab almost every week that involved learning how fairly complex software works (these took awhile I thought but Casana goes over them in class). There's also a final project worth 10% of your grade. Prof. Casana also grades very slow -- it's now winterim / delayed finals and he hasn't graded an assignment since Oct. 1. That said, he's very funny and I have learned a lot about geographical information systems and software, though not as much about archaeology. He's not a tough grader (A-/A is attainable so long as you put in the work) and is fun and helpful during class and office hours, though you may need to email him during office hours to make sure he comes. Overall, I don't regret taking this class per se, but it was a massive amount of work (like at least 10 hours outside class per week -- and more because I was bored / procrastinating) and there are easier ways to get a TAS. He's very nice though and the class is capped at 16 students (so you will get to know him and many of your peers). The class will likely have some outdoor components for on-campus students on campus (we used various instruments on the Green and flew a drone on the golf course!). Anthro majors do like the class more than I did, and I will say it's def not a waste of time because he's hilarious and very, very interested in the material, so that makes a dry subject matter a bit better.\""

It's cool to learn all of the bones in the body, whatever your motivations for taking the class. Muldoon is young, cool, and approachable. She reall knows her shit too--and by shit I mean bones.\""

Your grade mostly consists of bone quizzes, where you are given fragments of bone and must identify what bone, what side, and why. The first quiz is very overwhelming but that is just because you don't know what to expect but they definitely get better as the term goes on. There is a little bit of discussion about the ethics and craniometrics, etc. but the class is mainly just about identifying bones.\""

Prof. Endicott is a nice guy -- a little bit boring in class, but a fairly effective teacher who gets the point across. My beef is with his grading system, which just plain sucks. Essentially, he draws up a list of every single relevant fact on a particular subject, and as he goes through your essay, he deducts points for every thing you didn't mention. Essentially, you need to memorize even tangentially relevant facts; even if you have a great understanding of the topic holistically and write a good essay, you can still get as little as half credit simply because you didn't list enough trivia facts about the subject. Consequently, you wind up sacrificing knowledge of the importance of subjects for the actual content of factual tidbits.

The prompt for our only paper was to choose a modern business or institution and discuss its use of ancient Egyptian symbols and imagery as a marketing tool. He really gets a boner for modern misinterpretations of ancient Egyptian civilization and culture. Abdi can come off as an asshole at times, particularly when his religious bias seems to take over and he refuses to give any merit to Biblical stories whose setting is Egypt, namely the Exodus. He'll go on discussing all of the evidence that supports the Biblical claim of the existence of a prominent figure named Moses and of a large contingent of Jews during the New Kingdom, and then he'll seem to completely contradict everything he had just said by immediately following it with, \"but there really is no evidence the Jews were ever in Egypt during the New Kingdom times,\" without giving any evidence of his own to the contrary. It was kind of amusing at times, and he very well may have been telling the truth but his demeanor made me and others very skeptical. Also, to whom it may concern, this class is not a cross-listed class, but Ancient History majors can petition to have it count towards their major. I did, and it was probably easier than any Classics class the Department offers. All in all, it's a really easy class.

Additionally, I did no work for this course beyond attending class and reading from the picture book that served as our textbook. Thus I can't complain about the workload or the course material. That being said, both the mid-term and final were poorly put together, arbitrarily graded and just generally unrepresentative of what I had learned. Prior to the mid-term, Professor Abdi gave us a review sheet, and many people in the class assumed that it represented what would be on the test. They were wrong. Abdi tested us on everything (I'd assumed he would go beyond the review sheet, but he really got into some minute details). It was a bit ridiculous. The final was a rather poorly defined project that involved the creation of an Egyptian history museum in about 5 pages. It was a rather impossible project given how many different genres and time periods he wanted represented. Had I not been NROing the class, I probably would have made the effort to talk to him about it. Alas, I did not and burned one of my NROs in the process. Bottom line, this class is very easy in terms of workload but not an automatic A, so you might consider using the NRO.\""

He is incredibly interesting, engaging, and interested in what the students have to say and to do; I feel like I learned more here about anthropology than in almost any other class I've taken here. But it would be a very valuable class for people in other social sciences, too.

It gave practical experience which many Dartmouth courses don't seem to offer. This part was really as time consuming as you made it, but you really do need the time for it and it was a lot more difficult, yet rewarding, than any of us had anticipated.

The hands-on ethnographic assignments were fun, and they really helped me get a sense of what actual fieldwork might be like. My only complaint is that I had to spend a disproportionate amount of time doing these assignments, and therefore had to cut in to the time I would have otherwise devoted to my other classes. The readings and classroom discussions gave me lots of crazy ideas about starting my own projects in the field. I can't wait to get started. Welsch probably has the most effective teaching style I have experienced. Every class was an informal discussion that usually went off on many different tangents, but in the end he managed to tie all the different lines of conversation together and relate them to the topic du jour. He also went out of his way to schedule appointments with each of us to discuss our developing research papers and offer constructive advice.\"",

We all had the floor at one point or another. The professor talks about himself a lot, but we all got used to that. I ended up really liking the professor's style and his desire to make us really think about the ethics and methodology of anthropology. A great course for anyone thinking about anthropology, and a good course for life in general--a guide to effective and unbiased people-watching. I didn't have much in the way of expectations to begin with. I was intimidated because I was the only sophomore in a class of senior and junior majors, but that quickly dissipated. I feel as though it definitely contributed to my understanding of methodology, but the course was no walk in the park. If you're prepared to work hard, take it, because the class is well worth it. However, there is little graded material--it's entirely class participation, a 20 page ethnography, and a 15 page grant proposal. The papers are fun to write, but nonetheless challenging. I would definitely recommend this course. Both the professor and the course \"make the course,\" but a lot fo the class is student-directed, which means it all depends on the motivation of the people in the class.\""

Chances are he's either read or reviewed the book you're using so you can ask him anything if you don't understand it. The readings are pretty extensive but are interesting for the most part. He'll assign one huge chunk within the first few weeks of term to weed people out but it gets better after that.

Simply put, Alverson is the man. He is an expert in the field and has done some fascinating work over the course of his career, including an ethnography of the Dartmouth pong scene. His lectures are top notch and cover all the basics of good fieldwork. The course is framed as half theory and method then half fieldwork project. Alverson described it as \"learning recipes\" then \"actually cooking.\" The first half's readings were somewhat dry at times as theoretical musings and advice can be, but they helped to teach us the rules and best practices. The second half - the fieldwork project- was a truly unique experience. You have 3 and a half weeks (one of which is Thanksgiving break) to do field research on an Upper Valley housing project or nonprofit such as the Senior Center or the Haven. Then you write a 30 page ethnography to turn in along with 80+ pages of fieldnotes and jottings. If that sounds like a lot of writing, it is. The project is fascinating and frustrating. Most of us felt that we really did gain an understanding of how to conduct good ethnographic research, but it's tough to get the full experience and feel like you really gave the topic what it deserved over such as short period of time. Each site has its own time constraints, so it can be really hard to do as much fieldwork as you would like. That said, this course is the core of the cultural anthropology major at Dartmouth. If you plan to pursue the field further after graduation or intend to write a senior thesis, take this. Be prepared for a LOT of work but a lot of useful skills. I took this as one of four courses and it was really a challenge - I would probably not recommend that for future students. Good luck!\"",

            "review 3: \"07F with Hoyt S.: Make no mistake, this is not a throwaway class; you will have to work hard. However, it's both a really fun class and a really interesting class, because rather than learning scientific, disciplinary facts, you're actually learning a process and real-world techniques. In this respect, it's a refreshing blast of practical rather than academic learning. The course is divided into two parts: the first half of the course is a pretty typical class -- readings, class discussions, and a subsequent (open-note) midterm worth 25%. We only met once a week (3A; a three-hour Monday class). For the second half of the course, you conduct an actual research project at a site in West Leb or White River Junction, culminating in a 20-30 page ethnography (plus all your notes and journals). The last bit is all of challenging, scary, probably unprecedented for you, and extremely fast-paced (first visit --> due date in about four weeks). Very interesting, though. Alverson is great, but as he's not teaching this class anymore, a review of his professorial skills is irrelevant. Prof. Lourdes Gutierrez will be teaching the class from now on -- look up reviews of her, because I've had her before and opinions were mixed.

So be prepared to spend a number of hours away from campus taking field notes, typing them up, coding them, and finally writing your own 20 page ethnography.

He also assigned a TON of reading, then would say in class, \"oh yes, this paragraph is actually the only important part of the 50 page reading you all just did.\" There's no reason for a prof to assign a huge reading load that will not even be discussed. He also assigned quite a few short papers, which is not a problem in itself. However, Welsch wouldn't read them at all, he just slaps on a grade, and then returns the papers many weeks after they've been turned in, so it is impossible to get any feedback on how you're doing in the course.

            "review 8: \"02S with Robert L.: Professor Welsch would make an excellent martial arts instructor. Imagine that you've just joined a dojo studying karate. You're practicing stances with the class when the instructor calls you out and comments on how horrible your footing is. With the whole class watching, he makes you adjust your position. He nods in satisfaction and goes back to the stances. At this point, you're feeling about two inches high and perhaps a bit pissed off at the instructor for seeming to always pick on you. But six months later, your stances are rock solid and you're thanking your instructor over lunch. Medical anthropology is a great course. You will definitely learn a lot from this course, but you have to be willing to work hard and also keep an open mind. Reviews about professor Welsch tend to be rather polarized. Some people love him, some people hate him. I don't think it's possible to not have an opinion. In his own words, he wants to challenge his students. He treats everyone equally, and he will also critique everyone equally. Moreover, he will criticize you in front of others so that you can learn from each other's mistakes, just as the whole class benefits from your sensei correcting your position. I think he does this because he loves what he does. He loves teaching, and will go out of his way to help his students to learn, provided that they make an effort as well. But along the way he will not pull any punches in terms of correcting mistakes. He will always point out when you're wrong, and that can be quite intimidating, especially when that happens in front of the class. But keep in mind that this is not at all personal and everyone in the room will most likely experience that at some point. I hope that sheds some light on the professor. The course material is great. This is a reading course and be prepared to (at first glance) have an outrageous amount of reading. You'll learn how to read these articles objectively and skip the unimportant parts. Part of the reason there is so much reading is to force you to read actively. My last comment: almost everyone who takes the course (and Professor Welsch as well) has noticed that women seem more likely to not like Professor Welsch's teaching style than men. Perhaps that is because women are more likely to take his criticisms personally than men are. I'm a guy, and I've had a marine yelling in my face at Boy's State, and Robert Welsch is a gentle breeze in comparison. (Maybe women have similar experiences, I'm sure they do, but it's not really part of the cultural model, you know?) In short, Professor Welsch is very knowledgeable about his field of expertise and will do his best to change the way you view culture. He's very good, but it's not your average teaching style. Be sure to read the other reviews here. Notice how even the most scathing reviews of Professor Welsch admit that he leads some insightful lectures and the readings are good. I would also recommend Anthropology 20: Introduction to Ethnographic Fieldwork, which he teaches in the fall.

In fact, a lot of the time they seemed sort of useless. Although Cullinane very obviously means well, her lectures consisted of her regurgitating the readings, sometimes with powerpoint slides, sometimes not. Basically, if you had done the readings, her lectures were pointless because while going over the readings, she didn't explore them in depth. Rather, she just sort of repeated the readings! This made it difficult because class participation counted for 10% of the overall grade in the course, and what are you supposed to say, \"I agree that what you just said is the exact same thing the author wrote\"? It just didn't make a lot of sense. About halfway through the course, she decided to have students take over the role of telling the class what the readings were about. One other complaint about the course was that Cullinane seemed to know or accept only one perspective a lot of the time.

His lecture style contains many anecdotes (with plenty of self-calls), but his often cryptic nature sometimes wants him to actually give a direct answer once in a while. The class had a good run-through of materials, the majority of which one would never learn about without access to the class: interrogation simulations, Dartmouth PR cover-up debacles, and student presentations present a variety of topics are very intriguing. If one is willing to endure the stress and devote the hours to 150+ page readings (which range from mind-blowingly interesting to impossibly dense), then one can easily get a lot out of the class.

Once we understood that all published material is not always based in veritable fact, which is something most people already know, there was no reason to go to class- except that Professor Keith took attendance. In class, our intelligence was insulted on a regular basis. Because there is not enough information to fill a competent syllabus, we spent class time doing infantile group activities. One day we colored in pottery on a worksheet and compared our designs to prove that there are only so many ways a pot can be decorated. Another time, we had to interview three other students and discover three things we had in common with each of them. The purpose of this activity was to prove that coincidences exist. Another activity involved counting M&Ms. In addition to these exercises, we would often spend class time reiterating things we had already done rather than move on. For instance, towards the end of the term three power point presentations were posted on our class website and we received a fill in the blank worksheet that directly corresponded with these slides to fill out. We then spent an entire class period comparing answers to verify that we could all read. I wonder if it would have been a better use of class time to actually hear the lectures that were supposed to accompany these slides? After all, power point is a medium for presentation and many of the slides posted were not accompanied by information. At one point in the course, we were presented with information that was not in the readings, but because class time was spent so inefficiently, this information was sped into two rushed lectures. Beyond assigned readings, there was very little work to do outside of class: three tests, two of them open book/ open note, and a paper. However, our tests were evaluated by different standards than we were held to on a daily basis. The median on the mid-term was B- though the material was easy and exactly like the exercises we did in class every period. Though Professor Keith had a grading system, it seemed arbitrary. To her credit though, Professor Keith made a real effort in learning all of our names- a large class held in Loew. Discussions were limited to a handful of participants. Often, it seemed, no one wanted to bother answering the same questions that came up constantly or address the issues that related to every conversation. However, the class was accompanied by a website and we were often required to post opinions on a discussion board. Likewise, Professor Keith relied too much on her ability to contact us via blitz to relay announcements or give us additional information outside of class. It was not uncommon to receive two or three blitzes after class calling our attention to overlooked issues. X-hours were almost always called. I am an Anthropology major.

But, you get used to those assignments and they ended up not being so bad. The class discussions and material were fascinating to me, though, and we had some really interesting speakers come and talk to our class (all Montgomery fellows). We were required to attend 3 Montgomery lectures outside of class, but I honestly wish I had gone to all five. There were also 3 projects, all of which were interesting to me as someone who's never learned a thing about anthropology before. Take this class if you wanna learn something new. Might not be a layup, but the workload didn't make me want to die either. I have no regrets.\""

However, the flipside is that despite not feeling that I could competently complete the exams, I usually wound up with As despite myself. So perhaps she's just an easy grader, and her hard tests don't matter that much.\"",

Perhaps a little bit too exhaustive and abundant. I cannot stay awake in a course with no dialogue - just a professor talking non-stop for 65+ minutes. Some people loved the course. Some people were HARD-CORE about this course - they would try to put down each and every one of Nichols' words. I thought the subject matter was pretty interesting, but my two other courses were very time-taking and I had no physical ability to stay up late enough to study for this course as well. Probably that's why I think about it the way I do. But other, more conscientious people share my view that the reading is a little bit too much and digs too deep into sherds and names of ruins and types of precursors of wild wheat and maize. On the other hand, you learn that names like 18-Rabbit DID exist, and a bunch of other curious facts as well. The part about the ancient Maya and Aztecs invariably evoked the song \"Roots Bloody Roots\" in my mind, as you get to learn that human societies could be really disparate ideologically. If I have to be serious, the course provides you with some insights on how human societies evolved from bands of hunters and gatherers, but the stress was more on breadth of material than on depth of reasoning, and my mind does better at thinking than at memorizing an ocean of facts, so that put me off a little bit.

The readings were dull (although quite easy to read) and filled with biased. Basically, all that I took away from it is that anthropologists allow their bias to greatly influence their research and do not have definite answers for, well, anything. In addition, I did not learn anything new \u2013 all of the material had been covered in my freshman year of high school world history course. I guess this can be just written off as the problem with the INT distrib \u2013 it requires that areas be looked at on an international basis in 10 weeks. This does not allow for an adequate focus upon any particular area. But, I did manage to satisfy my final distributive requirement with a minimum of effort. The issue with the classroom was quite interesting. A class should never be filled beyond the capacity of the classroom. Also, it is also rather interesting that there are so many \u201csmart\u201d classrooms that the professors that teach in them do not know how to use the room. I believe that if an instructor is going to teach in a smart classroom, then he/she should learn before the beginning of the class how to use the technology \u2013 wasting half of the class to wait for a video to start when all is needed is to hit one button is completely unacceptable. At least the guest lecturer attempted to make use of the newer technology to give a PowerPoint presentation. Sadly, it was quite evident that he has not had much experience giving presentations \u2013 if I were to give a presentation like his in any of my courses, I would have received a D at best. During the lectures, it is evident that Professor Nichols makes an effort to educate the class \u2013 although her tone tends to become monotone occasionally.

This was how she rationalized changing the take-home essay to an in-class one (where we were not permitted to type our essays on laptops).

He is aware of the culture of drinking and skipping readings, and though that does not affect his assignments, he is aware that most of the kids in the class do not read the readings. He even suggested engaging in what he called \"selective readings\" which is \"reading only the things necessary for the papers.\" His realistic attitude towards teaching and his extensive knowledge on the subject make Professor Abdi one of the best professors I have encountered.\"",

Class pretty much explains everything, and you can do readings specific to your final paper and do just fine. The topics are interesting. We didn't spend as much time on some of the \"next step\" issues, on what societies were like just after agriculture was developed, but we did get to cover it to some extant. Next year (W04) it's offered as a normal course, not a freshman seminar, so the dynamic may be different. I doubt it though, it didn't seem like any of the seminars my friends were in.

The professor was also biased and played heavily on her favorites, those who shared her perspectives and did not waiver from her ideals. The grading of papers was arbitrary and unfair.

The study of actual women's roles in different ancient societies was a sort of secondary theme, and the information on the subject was generally discussed in reference to modern perceptions and possible misinterpretations. The course did include an individual research paper which was fairly open-ended with regard to topic, so in that way it did allow for exploration on areas of particular interest to individual students. Discussion of individual research in class was the source of most of the specific information on women's roles in particular societies. Professor Keith was very good in helping students find information and develop topics if they needed help. She also allowed the class itself to determine the course of classroom discussion to a great extent, and was open to student suggestions regarding the class structure (for example, we had class outside on some of the nicer days).\"",

The course talks a lot about ethical development as well as critiquing how the human body is perceived by doctors, people, etc. Bonus - this course is worth taking just for the amazing collaboration with Rauner Library - Craig incorporates a day a week where you look at / compare rare works of a certain topic. I'd never been in Rauner let alone used rare works for class, but after this course, Rauner is super familiar and accessible. Professor: Craig rocks. For most of the term I wasn't sure how much she liked me, but being a seminar & a small group, she's very good at making sure you're heard in class and is always willing to spend a few minutes after / in a meeting outside of class with you to discuss what you're working on , etc. She's also been personally very helpful with agreeing to write recommendations & giving advice on independent foreign studies. Workload: The workload was manageable. The syllabus is definitely a good representation of how much work is expected: several readings a week (which are hard to skip as there's 1 assigned per day and daily discussion about the readings), 1 page written response online (really graded for completion), a med-student interview + final Anthropological paper on some medical school-related topic of your choice, and a final project using Rauner works to convey some anthro argument about ethics, medicine, doctors, illness, etc.\""

Dobson expects you to go above and beyond, connecting topics to each other and \"analyzing the context of each term within the study of human evolution.\" OK... did that, feel solid about the test...

Apparently everyone else had the same idea, b/c I had to claw my way into the class. In response to these 2 expectations: Interesting? Yes.. Incredibly interesting, actually for me, perhaps one of THE most interesting classes I've taken at Dartmouth. If I took it earlier on, I may have ended up taking more classes in this field. The course is divided into 3 sections: first genetics/evolution, second human variation, third human evolution. the last is by far the most interesting and every lecture was fascinating. As for the second part... easy? Kind of... this is by far the least work i have ever had to do for a class. The only reading is a textbook, (which is actually interesting) but which he makes clear you don't even need to open b/c he won't test from it. 3 (non-cumulative!) exams and a paper which was optional for us (i didn't do it). So in the end, the entire work for the course consisted of studying for these 3 tests. What makes this 'kind of' though is the fact that these tests are kind of odd... they are 10 question short answers... the questions themselves are straight-forward and easy.... the problem is maybe b/c they're easy and everyone has learned the material - he's extremely picky with grading. he grades them on a 0-10 pt scale and i still don't see the difference between a 10 and 9 or a 9 and an 8... somehow you kind of figure it out...you just need to know EVERYTHING but don't say anything irrelevant or too much. and like one other person on here said, he doesn't like using an example to explain something. The other problem is Prof. Dobson himself. No one else seemed to have this issue but maybe they didn't go see him... he's funny, likeable, and a great lecturer... but he's kind of weird to engage with. Even though he clearly knows his stuff, he seems insecure/defensive in a way that makes it difficult to talk to. Also don't bother figuring out why you got an 8 and not a 9 on a question... he gets really touchy, defensive, and ticked off, as if you're questioning his authority (even though i made it very clear that's not what i was trying to do). In the end I somehow got an A in the class even though I wasn't expecting to... i think the key is to really figure out what kinds of questions he'll ask and know how to explain something well... obviously go to class, you'll understand the way he would want you to answer the question.

The rest of the class was pretty good though; the most interesting lecture to me was the one showing scientifically that there's no such thing as race. That lecture alone is worth taking the class. The tests in this class can be tricky. They're short answer questions where we basically have to describe something or compare two things and relate them to the underlying theme (depending on which section the test is on). I thought the grading on this is a little subjective; he grades each answer between 5-10 and I was a little confused on the difference between a \"9\" answer and a \"10\" answer. There's no curve in this class. Otherwise, a decent class worth taking if you might be interested in bio anthropology.

It's something that I could read about on my own and not get bored to tears, and I found myself curious about the subject matter. The class itself really isn't a whole lot of work. There was a total of three tests and one optional paper, so most of the homework was studying for the tests. Professor Dobson is a pretty good lecturer - he keeps things light in class, and has a very specific agenda about what will be covered in each lecture. There were only two downsides that I could find in this class. One had to do with the textbook. The book itself I found was fine. It was difficult, the reading wasn't intensive, and it was informative. The issue was that the professor didn't always agree with the book, and basically said that it was for supplemental information. What makes this tough is when you don't fully understand something in the class, you have to turn to a book that the teacher doesn't exactly endorse. The second issue was Professor Dobson has a grading system that is a bit quirky. You have to get all the concepts from his lectures and lectures alone (so don't miss them), and when you answer questions on tests, he deducts points for giving examples. Just some oddities like that. Outside of those two things, however, the class is quite good. Don't expect to get an easy A though. The class is good, and the workload is light, but it isn't easy, and it isn't a breeze. The fact that the workload is so light makes learning the material tougher. Just keep that in mind.

Make sure you have a firm grasp of the central topic for each midterm before taking it and study in a way that relates every part of your notes back to that concept. Learn his style of grading. It's very fair, but there's little room for error--too little information means points deducted and too much info (even if it's correct but not really pertinent) means points deducted.

This was reiterated multiple times to the point where it became common sense. Oh but wait, it was already common sense to begin with to everybody in the damn room. This class was a waste of tuition.

They were arbitrarily graded, and the comments were unusually harsh given the professor's complete failure to explain what exactly the bloody hell he was expecting. After handing back the papers, he proceeded to rant about how poor our writing was and how we had failed to include shit that he never even asked for. Everyone was pissed. The best part of the class were the videos that he showed. You know, the modern ones--oh but wait no, they were outdated ones produced in the 1970s or so. They were the kind of videos that begin with a crude purple logo and say, \"Funding provided by __________\" accompanied by off-key music, signaling that it's going to be crap.

This is how the class works. You go to lecture. The first week or two, you take notes and try to record everything that wierdo says. Then you realize its a waste of time because he tells you that before each test he will give you a review sheet. Once you get the review sheet, you just have to go back to the index of the textbook and record every detail about each \"key word\" or \"Key person\" and memorize every last detail. On the test, you have to write as fast as you can to get everything down and your hand will really start to hurt. You still will get a lousy grade. The same goes for the two \"projects\" he assigns. You will have to write two papers in which you analyze the present day world from the perspective of an archaeologist in the future.

We had to write 3 out of 6 short essay assignments (3-4 pages), and there was a midterm and a final. On all of the essays (the assignments and also the ones on the tests), she would just slap a number grade on them without giving any feedback or justification. There were rubrics for the short assignments but the numbers assigned to the categories seemed equally arbitrary, just a few points knocked off here and there to get you down in the B+ range and that's where you stay. also the exams are very hard to study for - not because the material is especially difficult, but because you have to memorize all of the readings (to cite them in essays), and you usually don't know what to study because of the jumbled nature of the lectures. at least that was my experience. in the end, this class was what I was looking for, but it was frustrating because even though I went to every class and probably studied more than most people (about 1/3rd of the class stopped coming after the first midterm), my grade will most likely not be much higher than theirs because no matter how well you know the material, your grade is left more to chance than to your work ethic.\"",

That is, he brings up the same point six times. Now repetition isn't bad but six times is a bit excessive. It's not as if he adds new information to it he just says the old information six times. And round about the sixth time he says the same thing you're about ready to shoot him. You can get a kick out of his little devotees that sit in the front row and worship him, though.

He would ask them a question no one could understand and the whole class would suffer until he would just tell us the answer he was looking for.

The Reading: The main textbook (heider) was dry and long-winded. The monographs, however, were exceptionally well-written and highly interesting. In particular, \"In Search of Respect\" was a fantastic book--worth reading outside of classwork. 2. The Lectures: Lectures were boring boring boring. Fifteen minutes passed like half an hour or 45 minutes of another class. 3. The Films: This class met every single x-hour, usually to show a film. The films were really interesting and worth watching. 4. MOST IMPORTANT!!! The Prof: Welsch was, in my estimation, the worst professor I have had at Dartmouth. While on the one hand he was certianly knowledgeable and intelligent and has done fascinating field work, on the other he treats his students poorly. He frequently called students out in class to figure out if they had read (ok, that's reasonable, a prof wants you to read, and you should read) but if they hadn't he would take a mocking and snide tone with them in front of the entire class. He seemed to get some sort of pleasure out of embarassing students and treating them like fourth graders, which I found to be reviling. He frequently posed unclear questions and if you could not answer them to his standards he would basically accuse you of not having read. I almost NEVER understood his questions on the first shot, and I am a senior here with a good GPA, not an idiot. He was completely vague and confusing in general. He frequently belittled students in class, and I met with him outside of class and found him to take the same attitude in that forum as well. OVERALL: By all means take this class--I learned all kinds of really fascinating things about other cultures and about American culture as well. Definitely worthwhile.

For an anthro prof, he's a pretty closed minded guy as evidenced by the fact that when he opens up the class for discussion he is looking for people who say what he wants to hear. In addition he picks favorites out of the class and singles out people who he thinks aren't pulling their weight. AND he gets really mad when people aren't doing the reading like when you were in grade school. the paper we had to do was annoying especially since it was limited to 3 double spaced pages in which to compare two cultures in a very complex manner. he also basically wants you to write whatever he wants you to write unless you don't care about getting a C. I think seeing prof welsch in office hours regarding my paper bumped it up to a B+ from a B after rewriting it. Woopee. Sometimes I just think that he's mean spirited.\"",
            "review 12: \"02W with Robert L.: If you are looking for a gut class with a pathetic amount of reading and exams where the syllabus expressly states that \"you will not be tested on the actual material on this syllabus; rather you will be asked to demonstrate general understanding of the key concepts of this class I.E. you only need your BS skills, whether you study for the exams or not\" this is the class to take. However, the course is such a gut that it is actually very hard, because it is so difficult to take it seriously that neither you nor anyone else will do much of what little reading there is. Prof. Welsch organizes every class session not in a lecture format, but as a discussion section between himself and the class. This sounds like a really good idea, but given that the class had a very large enrollment (about 60 students), so the discussion was so generalized that nobody learned much of anything, particularly because nobody was doing any of the reading. Welsch is a professor who clearly knows his stuff, but he very quickly developed a very beligerent manner toward the the students--he did have a legitimate complaint, given that nobody was doing the reading, but he often took it to extremes, sometimes going to special effort to publicly humiliate certain students. This is the kind of thing I expect of my high-school teachers, NOT of professors at an Ivy-League institution. Finally, Prof. Welsch conducts his office hours in group sessions. One time, several people wanted to see him for advice on a paper, and he had them come into his office in groups of three, and had students read aloud their first drafts of their papers, and would then proceed to give devastating critiques in front of the other students, and would ask the students to comment on each other's papers and inform each other what was wrong with them. Welsch's critiques were legitimate, but they should not have been done in a public context.\"",

However, Gutierrez is one of the worst teachers I've had ever, not just at Dartmouth. She was unable to follow her own syllabus and we were constantly behind in lecture, so our reading assignments rarely related to the topic of class on any given day. Even when we finally got to a subject, the majority of reading assignments were only briefly mentioned. Class discussion was extremely rare, but good when it occurred- it's too bad it almost never happened. This was especially frustrating because the reading was pretty significant, especially for those who read and take notes like me; it took several hours for almost every class. Despite the fact that I read and outlined everything on the syllabus I still wasn't able to get all of her reading-related questions correct on the exams- again, really frustrating. In terms of grade weighting, the three assignments should have been weighted more and the exams should not have been worth so much. Also, the three assignments themselves should not have been equally weighted, because the first one required significantly more time investment than the others. The exams had a lot of grading subjectivity and she doesn't always explain why she takes points off. She also admitted at least once to a classmate that she just \"didn't like\" the way she had answered despite the accuracy of her response.

Anth1, which is basically Watanabe's class and nobody else's, does a really great job of introducing students to the whole field of anthropology, between cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology, and primatology. If anything, this class leans a bit to being cultural anthropology-focused, but that's also the largest subfield, and he always tied in the other subfields as well. The readings weren't always very well integrated with the lectures, but the readings tended to be interesting nonetheless. As far as the lectures go, some people say they're rambling with little student participation. I agree, I wish there were more in-class activities/discussions, but I wouldn't characterize Watanabe as \"rambling\" per se. He just has a lot to say with a lot of insight, and he rarely contradicts himself. He's also extremely personable and his passion for the subject shines through. He's a tough grader who values brevity and also clarity and comprehensiveness, and that's a tough balance to strike when writing for him. It's certainly not impossible to score within the A range though; all you have to do is answer the question. Grades are one short assignment worth 5%, two timed essay-based midterms, and a final paper. I'm very glad I took this course because I was exposed to new ways of conceptualizing culture, human nature, history, human evolution, and ways of navigating being a human being. Specifically, the last book we read (and the subject of the final paper) called \"In Search of Respect\" by Phillipe Bourgois is absolute fascinating, and I recommend reading that book even if you don't take the course. Overall I'd even consider this class layup-adjacent because the work you have to do between classes is usually relatively minimal (just readings that tend to be short), and getting a good grade is based on learning how to answer Watanabe's questions.

Professor Watanabe's lectures are at times too fast and too dense. But it is immensely interesting. Unlike in my other large classes, everybody showed up almost everytime. The PSYC majors destroy the curve in this class; they are very intense.\"",

Professor Watanabe is really awesome and engaged the class at every lecture. The readings were often deep and complicated, but always interesting too.

I would recommend to anyone this class which challenges how you think, write and live your daily lives. I really enjoyed this class, and if some reviews talk of Welsch being a tough professor, it is most likely because they didn't participate as much as they could.

I just did not like Welsch's teaching style at all - He says that he gets from point A to point B by getting students to answer questions, but in the end, it turned out that he called on the same people, who were willing to just feed the vocabulary word he is looking for.

Therefore, it was quite difficult to a) pay attention and b) keep track of any of the seemingly irrelevant information he seemed to spew at you and then ask you to repeat back on one of the exams. Regardless of how much work you put in preparing for the exams, his grading seems entirely too subjective and it is very tough to get an A in the class.\"",

His lectures are disconnected and make little to no sense. His power points consist of full paragraphs taken from the readings. He often will read these paragraphs with his back to the class during lectures. His knowledge of the subject seems limited, and in some cases, downright wrong. Most professor at Dartmouth are great, but this is not one of them. He and his class are a headache, and hopefully he won't be around for much longer. His tests don't even test the relevant subject matter. Instead, his questions are like \"what are the course objectives?\" Really? This isn't high school anymore, and that is where Professor Igoe belongs. Find a different Anthro class, because those taught by Igoe are NOT worth the headache.\"",

He also did a great job getting different speakers (different profs from the Anthro department as well as President Kim came in to give guest lectures.) The material itself as well as most of the readings are pretty interesting as long as you devote time to reading them seriously. Other than that, there's no work - there were two midterms and as long as you've been doing the readings, the lectures are of secondary importance on the midterms. Overall, it's a really interesting course. Though his lectures are sometimes dull, the material is always interesting, and he's a cool guy.\"",

He talks relatively slowly so it is easy to take notes. we also had a couple of guest lecturers (prof Nicholoson, prof Dobson and president Kim) who talked about very interesting topic the grading is somewhat tough, but exams are not that difficult (although they do require studying and some though). exams is a take home open book and thought-provoking. loved the course! definitely take it, even if you're a non major.

            "review 6: \"09F with James Igoe: I took this class just because I needed a third class and it could fulfill a distrib. Professor Igoe's teaching style was pretty straight forward. He posted his slides on blackboard and then basically read them to us during lectures, with a few tangents now and then. We watched a couple of movies and had a few guest lecturers (including President Kim which was pretty cool). The only time I did any of the reading assignments was the night before a test when I skimmed through important parts. There were two midterms which basically asked you to regurgitate the corresponding slides. The final consisted of 4 essay questions, each 2 pages single-spaced maximum. Again they required simply spitting back what Igoe had written in his lectures. You don't need to put much effort in to get a good grade and the class material was still overall pretty interesting. Professor Igoe's interests lie in the human interaction with the environment including the patterns of human consumption. I'm an environmental studies major so I found the focus of his class pretty interesting. If you're thinking of taking an Anthro class, definitely consider taking one of Igoe's classes that are more specific to Africa and the environment.\"",

Very easygoing, really knows his stuff and loves it. Gets so excited about material.

While the material is interesting, Alverson will ruin your term. For a class of probably 80 students, 80% of the readings were in the reserves room or jones media center. Because there was only 1 copy of each resource, it was nearly impossible to get the readings done on time. The lectures summarize the readings, but since he names specific details from the readings/ videos on the tests, the readings and videos are important. so if you are dead set on a class with this guy, start getting familiar with the reserves room wait list. The tests themselves (2 midterms and 1 final) are not exceptionally difficult, with usually around 8 short answers each. However, Alverson's grading is completely arbitrary. You can know the material cold and do all the assignments but there is still a very real chance of getting a D or C. Moreover, Alverson discourages people from going to office hours to discuss his grading methods. He actually told us on the very first day that he \"doesn't look favorably upon the practice, and the result could easily be a lower grade.\" Ultimately, I found that studying for the tests had no effect on my grade. In the end, bs-ing proved most effective. There is also a take home essay portion of the final. The only direction he really gave was to write about whatever you \"take issue with\" in this outdated article attached to the prompt. Again, bs-ing is your best option. With a different professor, I'm sure anth 1 would have been fantastic. But after a term with Alverson, I will never touch anthropology again. If you have to take something with this guy, NRO it.\"",
