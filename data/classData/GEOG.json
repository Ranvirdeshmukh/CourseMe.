Each week there is a presentation and then peer workshop on each section of a proposal, and the last three weeks are spent on drafting and editing the entire proposal, with presentations on the last day of class. The workload varied by week, depending on the section we were writing. There was some reading, but not too bad. This term, it was run as a 3A + x-hour each Monday (3 hours of class) and no other class time the rest of the week which lead to mostly independent work. I would take this class only if you need it for the major or are writing a geography thesis, as otherwise it probably isn't useful for you. The professors are both super nice and willing to give lots of feedback.\"",

The textbook was a waste of time... even the professors seemed to more easily point out its flaws than gather anything useful from the text. The course also almost completely relied on feedback and presentations from other students. I genuinely think that it's not an over-exaggeration that at least the class dreaded every single assignment. Several of us were also frustrated that we were expected to do so much of the teaching and reviewing, even though there were two professors who had actually written proposals before and would provide the most meaningful feedback. The professors do seem nice, personally, but none of the feedback given was actually specific in any way. Most of the feedback was essentially \"Elaborate way more on this, but don't increase the current word count.\" The schedule for the class was also terrible... and there was very little effort put in to making the class interesting enough to be bearable for three hours. We sometimes got a single short break, but I often had to leave the room for just a few minutes just to keep feeling sane. I'm also pretty sure that the department pushed to have these two teach the class and that nobody had a real interest in teaching it. Nothing over the course of the term seemed to suggest otherwise... the whole term it felt like the professors were putting in the bare minimum amount of effort. For a class like this, they should have chosen professors who better prioritize teaching and one-on-one learning (especially when there is a 6:1 professor to student ratio).\""

No joke, Abigail should be terminated for the stress and anxiety she put on 90+ kids mostly looking to explore a new subject. I have never in my academic career, witnessed harsher grading with little to no feedback on why we were just scraping by with passing grades. This is coming from an engineering major who is used to dealing with stupendously difficult content and steep practice sets/projects/assessments. Forcing us to wear N-95's is a joke when 99% of the students in that class almost certainly party and interact socially with the rest of campus on a daily basis. Whats even more of a joke is essentially making attendance not mandatory (recorded lectures) and then insisting that Covid was the reason for most of the class being gone.

Weathering is going well so far. There are four quizzes throughout the term, which is 80% of the grade, and she grades all the students' exams extremely harshly. She also reported a bunch of students' quizzes as an honor of code violence. There are 4 reading write-ups that come up randomly at the start of the class and in the first one, some of the guys were late for several minutes because they had a 9L class before, but she didn't accept the excuse and gave those people a 0. She also requires a mask during class which other class almost doesn't require, and students aren't allowed to use a device at all during class. In my opinion, I can't take enough notes hand-written making me watch the lecture recording every time even though I have other stuff to do. Geography Department is famous for being a great department in this school, but it would've been even better if she were out of this school. Don't take this class. I repeat. Don't take this class.

            "review 9: \"23W with Abigail Neely And Coleen Fox: TLDR: Take this class if you are a masochist. I would strongly recommend never taking a class with Neely as long as you are at Dartmouth. The class is as follows, there are four units. Within each unit, there is a random reading quiz one of the days. The readings are incredibly long, sometimes including multiple 20+ page readings and a 2 hour movie for one class. You might think that simply carefully doing the readings would be enough to do well on these reading quizzes but you would be wrong. Given the fact that they give you 5 minutes to produce them, it is essentially impossible to do well unless you write them and print them out ahead of hand. Similarly, these reading write-ups are graded incredibly stringently, meaning that if you the 2+ hours of reading and video watching required for a class and spend an additional 30-45 minutes on the write-ups there is still a chance you will get a 2/3 on the writeup. I attended every single lecture and rewatched all the lecturers before tests and still found the assessments difficult, not due to the difficulty of the subject matter but due to the incredibly vague questions asked and grading. Every assessment contains a matching section, and about half the definitions (which are incredibly vague) could easily apply to multiple terms so it is essentially a guessing game. As far as the class material goes, I consider myself very much politically neutral (and even liberal on many social issues) but Prof. Neely essentially uses the class to push her radical leftist beliefs on the class (I'm all for examing multiple viewpoints, even radical ones, but if you attempt to disagree with any of her beliefs you will be immediately shot down). Prof. Fox is nice enough and I won't say anything mean about her as I get the sense that she had little control in how the class was ran.\"",

She does the entire field of teaching a disservice by existing within the profession. I'm pretty sure profs don't have access to layup list, but I hope she somehow is able to read these reviews and understands the sheer, visceral hatred that students have for both her and her class. No feedback is offered in the class so I'll provide some of my own feedback for Professor Neely: QUIT YOUR JOB, YOU ARE BAD AT IT. This class should genuinely be recategorized in the English department or something as fantasy tales because they sure as shit weren't teaching any sort of scientific knowledge. For anyone who takes this class: go to a hospital, not a sangoma or whatever the fuck Neely recommended. It's kind of funny that she enforced such a strict masking policy but rejected any sort of western medicine ideas. Go figure. Schoolwork aside, I will go to the grave believing that Abigail Neely is unfit to teach at any academic institution. Her email signature was the title of her published book and a discount code. Just an overall completely unserious individual. I NRO'd this class so honestly, I could not care less about my grade but yeah the grading is completely unfair and Neely was on a witch hunt to screw kids over throughout the term.

Neely and Sneddon are so understanding of students' needs. I'm not a Geography major, but I gained so much from this class. Class structure consisted of: -A group study guide where students summarize different assigned readings on a rotating basis each Monday and Wednesday by 8 AM, and the rest of the students comment on the summaries by 11:59 PM that night. Average grades on those are a 90, but you can easily get an 100 if you try. The lowest 4 get dropped, and if you miss one and get a 0, you can easily go back and make up a summary or comment for full credit, just email the TA. -4 open-note (not open-internet) assessments. These usually consist of 1. matching terms to definitions, 2. defining terms and describing where you first read or heard the term, and 3. a short essay. Because they're open-note and open-class material, you can pretty much find all of the answers in your notes, in the lecture transcripts, the assigned readings, or your group study guide. Just use your time wisely. Also, your lowest assessment score is dropped. -Weekly discussions on Fridays. Participation is 10% but you can do these discussions in-person, virtually, or asynchronously. The asynchronous option is a discussion post that you can honestly go back and complete past the date of the discussion. -Lectures every Monday and Wednesday, same deal - you can go in-person, virtually, or watch the lectures later asynchronously, since they're recorded. I'd recommend going and taking notes so the assessments are easier, but you always have the asynchronous option. All of this is to say - I got an A and did 90% of the course asynchronously.

Winter's study guides and materials that he provides are almost a mirror image of the exams and if you study at least a little bit and go to class you can do well. The only thing that was very upsetting is that he takes a long time to grade and give things back which makes it hard to study from the mistakes you made in previous assignments but he is always available during office hours to answer any questions. It should be noted, however, that when he took very long to grade our second problem set he gave everyone an extra 0.5 points (\"if i would punish you for turning something in late, i will punish myself for grading late\"). Not necessarily a layup, but not a super hard class either.\""

You're expected to learn a lot of different concepts and produce a lot of labs/group projects, but I think most of the people in the class were pretty confused half of the time.

Course material was frankly quite boring, and just about everything we talked about was stuff I'd either learned in other Dartmouth courses/departments, high school, or things you could easily Google. Nothing was covered with much depth, everything felt pretty superficial. It also neglected to talk about a lot of the more social justice and equity-based conversations about food and agriculture, which was really disappointing, especially for a geography course. If you don't have much experience/knowledge in climate change and/or agriculture, then I think this class would be a great fit for you, especially if you're just trying to knock out a science distrib.

Winter is a great professor- he is very open to answering questions both in and out of class, and will find answers even if he doesn't know immediately. The problem sets were very reasonable; I had to attend office hours usually once per set to get some questions answered, but they were fair and there was plenty of time given to complete each one. There were readings for most classes (textbook only for the first few weeks), but not very long and not challenging to comprehend. The midterm and final were challenging but seemed very fair and went fine with moderate studying. The class moves from learning about how industrial agricultural systems work across the world, to climate change (mechanisms and mitigation) and then the combination: effects of climate change on agriculture. Not a layup, but not too challenging either- highly recommend!\"",

Your grade comes completely from problem sets and tests, and he is a fair but careful grader. If you get a bad grade on one of the five assignments it can be extremely hard to recover from, but if you perform well on all five then you're totally fine. I believe he normally curves tests in person, but for remote classes he does not curve them.\"",

However, there are only two exams and very little class prep. It is hard but certainly not impossible. I think I am on target for a A- if I do well on the final (probably a B+ if I don't) and I haven't had to sacrifice my social life or mental wellbeing to get there.

There are a ton of readings (that you pretty much have to do \u2014 all of them become necessary either in the midterm, the final paper, or weekly discussions) and a quarter long project that is very, very time consuming. The project is pretty interesting and flexible, but pretty easy to fall behind on and ends up being thousands of words of writing, in addition to a summary paper, final paper, and presentation. The midterm requires lots of memorization and deep conceptual understanding of every reading and lecture. It's also relatively impossible to know what grade you're going to get/where you stand \u2014 the final project, final paper, and participation are all graded at the end, so the only grade you have to go off of throughout the term is the week 5 midterm grade. That being said, Fox is amazing. Like SO smart. If you go to office hours and ask for her help she will answer your question and beyond and essentially start writing your paper for you. It is so clear that she is such an expert on what she is talking about which makes her lectures very interesting, but also, they sort of are just her talking for an hour straight. Not much structure which makes them kind of challenging to follow. Overall, very interesting class, definitely changes the way you think about the world, and awesome, crazy smart professor, but don't take it unless you're ready to put in the time/work.

This class is a lot of work: actually doing the nightly readings for the first half of the class is essential to doing well on the midterm, and the term-long project is a TON of work, especially if you try to do a big chunk at the last minute. The class was pretty lecture-heavy in the first half before transitioning to group discussion in the second half of the course.

I generally enjoyed it and learned a lot. However, after the second class I sent her a long email about a question I had, ending with an invitation to meet and talk about it. She just told me to read a few more chapters from a book. This set the tone for her teaching style. She's fun in class but doesn't want to discuss ideas. She gives lectures and has you regurgitate her ideas on two exams. In this way, it's not hard \u2013 but it feels very dogmatic. I saw a midterm she graded with no feedback (all short-answer, each q 1-5 sentences) other than points docked, and she didn't give back a grade on the final (only) paper or the final exam. Domosh also revels in telling students they're wrong; at least once a class, she would respond to a student's answer, \"I love how you're thinking...... But you're wrong (long pause).\"\"",

The exams are just memorizing and regurgitating whatever Domosh says in class.

I thought the pace of the class was great- every lecture/discussion was pretty engaging and really easy to follow. There are readings every class (20-40 pages normally) but they're more supplemental to the class. Not sure how the exams would go if you don't read any, but they're definitely more significantly based in class work. Prof Domosh is very kind and understanding and super accessible both in and out of class. I highly recommend it!\"",

Also, she gave the final before finals week, so it was horrible to study. You don't really need all the readings for the test, taking good notes is the key. Her explanations are good and she is very experienced in this area. That said, I wouldn't have taken this class if I knew how it went down.\""

One of the best assignments was an essay following a diary documenting how gender influenced your experiences in different spaces on Dartmouth's campus. Prof Fox is somewhat traditional in that she doesn't allow computers in class and likes assignments to be turned in on paper. At first, I found this annoying but I realized how much it contributed to my engagement in class. All that being said, she is strict and expects her students to perform well.

In other words, only half an hour of anything synchronous per week. We had to write several \u201cjournal\u201d entries each week in a Google Doc on our personal experience and reflections during the pandemic. The journal requirement was waived during midterms/Week 5. The only obnoxious part of the course was the 11:59pm Friday deadline for reflections.

The grading is arbitrary because the rubric appears like a number line where the TA (Lopez isn't even the one grading most assignments) circles a spot on the line. The line has no numbers, so you don't know how many points you lost in each category. Generally speaking, I wouldn't say I like how the TA is the one grading most assignments because I can tell that they are close to some students in class, so I suspect that this impacts how they grade certain students. I would very much prefer if the professor were the one grading and the TA was the one providing the feedback. Although I met with the TA numerous times and applied all the feedback to my final, I did not receive the final paper grade I expected. There is a disconnect between the professor's expectations and the TA's. I would consider this a fake layup, as it had a lot of writing assignments. Yeah, the professor allows you to submit them whenever as long as you have a reasonable excuse, but I suspect that everything piles up if you constantly ask for extensions.

Honestly didn\u2019t rlly learn a ton but it was a somewhat easy A. Still requires effort and somewhat of an understanding of concepts/key texts but she is a VERY easy grader\"",

Sometimes though, the in-class discussions were.. painful? Maybe it was because the material was sometimes about difficult topics and everyone was tired from the winter term and Covid.

She also cancelled the 12-15 page research paper due at the end of the term. If we had to do that, I wouldn\u2019t consider this class a layup because it would require a lot more work. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll end up with a good group like I did and you can do a lot of the assignments like the midterm paper as a group and distribute the work which makes it easier.

The class itself is very interesting \u2013 lots of important theories and room to research whatever you please.

I would call the class a layup, even though there is quite a bit of reading and a few essays/writings that you have to do. You can get away with not doing most of the readings/skimming them before class. Most of the writing can be treated as free writing prompts that you don't have to edit (especially the reflection and social impact practicum projects); however, the check-in essay (midterm paper on class readings, 6-7 pages) and the final paper (10-12 pages on you social impact practicum) are more formal essays that you do need to spend some time on. The social impact practicum is a project that you embark throughout the term that is somehow care labour - topics include being a UGA, working on research, working in DDS, working in the library, student activism, sports ... honestly anything works if you clear it with her. If you don't want to do a SIP, you can also do a research project, though I'd recommend doing the SIP because you have to write more for the research project. Definitely try to talk to Lopez outside of class - she is hilarious and is deeply invested in not just your learning but your mental well being. Would recommend this class!\"",

            "review 1: \"23W with Jonathan Winter: This class sucks. Like the other reviewer, I expected this class to be a massive layup. The readings were truly atrocious. The first half of the term, readings would be like 80 pages of a book, and then a 250 word reading reaction. At the start I took them very seriously and spent way to much time on them, and for the last reading reactions, I literally read the abstract and then did the reading reactions in like 5 minutes. There are 3 horrendous parts of this class: 1) Winter's lecture style is atrocious. This class is so dam (<--hilarious) boring. We did this whole unit on making presentations interesting and making them pop, and then proceeds to deliver the most brain numbing speeches on water I have ever heard 2) There is no connection between what we learn and assignments. There was never a time I was tested whatsoever on anything I learned in class. 3) His rough draft to final draft comments are useful, but the grades are ridiculous. I had friends talk to him multiple times in office hours about essays, to get a LOWER score on their final than their rough draft. Overall, I did fine in the class because I grinded on the final paper, but overall recommend to NOT take this class.\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with Jonathan Winter: I had pretty high hopes for this class going in as I generally find the course material pretty interesting, however, the class was very disappointing. The readings are absolutely horrible and he makes you write responses to them to make sure everyone does the readings. Because the readings are so bad, the discussions about them, which take up a large portion of the class, are super awkward and no one wants to talk. The writing assignments are pretty straightforward and allow you to take them in a direction you will find interesting, but he grades rough drafts as though they are final drafts and uses these grades in final grade calculation, so make sure that your rough draft is as good as you can possibly make it and don't wait until the final draft to improve and revise. I thought that his comments on my writing were fair, but maybe a little nitpicky. He is a very good writer and has a high standard of writing for his students, which is valuable in a seminar. My only quarrel is that the style of writing done for the final essay, a scientific review, was not taught in class and we had to learn through reading scientific articles rather than instruction. Many people had lower grades than they thought they deserved throughout the term, but they generally seemed to bump up in the end because the manuscript is such a massive part of the grade. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are super interested in dams and water infrastructure (like REALLY interested) and have notably good existing writing skills.\"",
            "review 3: \"23W with Jonathan Winter: Like my fellow reviewers have said, stay far, far away from this class. A B+ median (in a seminar??) is just the start of my issues with this course. The readings are extremely dense and boring, and after the first two, I simply found chapter summaries of the books in the class and changed words and submitted them. Save yourself the time for reading it because I never got a point taken off of the reading reactions. Next, be extremely careful on your rough drafts - he grades them harshly and will be extremely nitpicky about your writing. I would suggest showing him your work to get constructive criticism, but there are kids in the class that met with him multiple times and then did WORSE on the papers. He talks about having interesting presentations and having color in them when he has black and white, dense slides. The more I write, the more annoyed I get by this class and the way it's taught. Do yourself a favor and don't take it - there are way easier seminars that are more interesting, taught better and are more fun. Don't make my mistake!\"",

If you're not interested in dams and are taking this class for the SCI credit, you're going to find the reading pretty boring. You can skim them and still write sufficient reading reactions. That said, the reading assigned on other topics such as how to make a good presentation, and examples of good opinion editorials were really well chosen and interesting.\"",
            "review 5: \"21S with Jonathan Winter: The class load is fairly straightforward and easy with an alright amount of reading. However, you have to be pretty good at writing already if you want to get an A in the class. There are three major components to your grade, a presentation, opinion editorial, and review manuscript. The class is kinda boring unless you are into dams and water geography. The class doesn't really help you get better at writing, it honestly just made me feel discouraged. All my previous writing classes at Dartmouth were definitely more enjoyable than this class. TLDR: If you are already good at writing and need an easy SCI credit, take this class.\"",
            "review 6: \"20S with Jonathan Winter: I took this seminar asynchronously because of timezone differences, watching recorded class meetings. I think it is a fair way to earn a SCI distributive with some interesting readings and a scientific manuscript as the culminating paper. Some of the readings are dense, but you can get through the reading reactions by reading the first and last sentences of each paragraph and dedicating about 1/3 of it to your thoughts about the reading. The one time you do have to read more carefully is when you are assigned the discussion presentation (everyone does this once during the term). This is also probably one of the few classes where you will lose points on the rough drafts (which are graded out of 5 points with 1/4 point increments), which seemed unfair at first, but the professor does give thorough feedback. As one of the younger professors, Professor Winter is quite chill otherwise, and I was disappointed that I couldn't get to know him more. If you're interested in climate change and need an \"easier\" way out of one of the SCI distributives, Thirsty Planet could be a good option for you!\"",

That being said, she assigned a ridiculous amount of reading per week. The readings are very interesting, but they are difficult to get through if you are not familiar with much critical literature or have not done this kind of reading in the past. The class structure was mostly discussion based and in the latter half of the class we would have a guest speaker that was the author of one of the readings we did that week which was pretty cool. Each week she made us to a reading reaction (2 pages) and you had to turn in a printed copy during class. The final was a paper on a topic of your choosing that was at least somewhat related to the content of the course, she was pretty liberal with it. If you\u2019ve had her before, you know what to expect out of her as a person. She is a nice person and always wanting to talk during office hours about anything. I will say she basically gives you no feedback on anything ever. She will scribble illegible things on the things you turn in and give you a checkmark without anything else.\"",

The course is required for all Geog majors, so you don't really have much of a choice as to whether or not to take the class. Depending on the number of majors, the department usually offers two sections of Geog 90 -- I personally like Domosh and therefore decided to take it with her. If you've had her before, you'll basically know what to expect. Most days, we spent the first half of the 10A discussing the readings, then we took a break and hung out with the people in Prof Wright's section (and on Thursdays, the dept. provided snacks for us), and then we'd usually do some sort of group activity relating to the topic during the second half. Although it was a \"seminar,\" I think that she probably did more talking than anyone else in the class (and she loves to talk, too...). However, she often kept us pretty entertained, and most of us would end up laughing at some ridiculous thing she would say or do during class each day. Domosh was very nice/approachable (although she was horrendous at responding to blitzes...), and it showed that she loved teaching a class of all senior majors, which made for a fun course. With regards to the assignments, there were two-page reading reactions due for every class, as well as two group projects (papers & a presentation) and a final research paper that was the HUGEST pain ever. Basically, we had to write a paper reviewing the scholarly work that has been done analyzing a certain segment of cultural geography, and for a 10-15 page paper, we were supposed to have 40-50 (!) sources -- basically, you just talk about what all different geographers have been studying on a certain topic. The paper was a major pain to do the research for, and was a bit of a pain to write, but she's not a super hard grader, so I'm sure that most of us did fine anyway. In class presentations were usually fun/interesting, although Domosh had a tendency to interject (a lot!). We all kind of got used to it after a while. Basically, if you've had her before, you'll know what to expect, and if you haven't, hopefully you'll have some sense of what the course is like with her.\"",

He pretty much did my final project lmao and he's very generous with extensions. I ended up with an A minus in this class which I definitely didn't deserve since I turned in half the labs late and put in pretty minimal effort. The class has a decent amount of work: 6 labs (some of which took a long time) and a final project with a few other assignments sprinkled in. But honestly, as long as you do all of the work on time and put in a decent amount of effort, you should be able to get an A.\"",

The first time I had to leave during week 7 because of medical issues, but I stayed on for the next winter Chipman was teaching this because I knew this would be the EASIEST way to get my SCI/SLA distrib. I am NOT a science person (anthro/socy major here!) The great part about this class is that class time is used for one of the lab times, so you save time! You can check the book on reserve from Kresge and he also provided the book in the lab. Not a lot of people used it. His power points are literally on point! There are a couple of pop quizzes (only 3, and one of them is group quiz so you should be fine), and there is only ONE midterm. It's taken towards the end while you are dealing with final projects, so that's a little annoying and I hope he changes it. I am only good at papers and following instructions on the lab handouts, so if you do well on the labs and barely study for the midterm, you will pass with a B. (i got a 70). Most people are not familiar with web design (I was obsessed with HTML and CSS as a kid), so don't worry to much if this is your first time with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

            "review 1: \"17W with Robert Hawley: Course: The course had two components: lectures and labs. The lectures covered the \"theory\" of remote sensing, which basically consisted of understanding how different scanners capture satellite imagery on planes and satellites as well as how the resulting images of earth's surface can be analyzed with geometry and software techniques. The theory was fairly interesting, as we got to see a lot of technical disciplines at work -- earth science, engineering, computer science, etc. We were assigned a problem set and a midterm testing us on the theory, but neither were particularly difficult if one took the time to review their notes, ask questions, and consult the textbook. The second component, the labs, covered the \"practice\" of remote sensing. Every we week we had to go through an 6-10 page tutorial on how to use different features of a sophisticated software for satellite imagery analysis. These labs could take eight hours to complete. Sometimes they required 1500-2000 word write ups, which seemed like busy work because it was very hard to fill 1500 words based on what we were supposed to include. Overall these labs felt like a big waste of time, as I doubted I'd ever use the software again. Unless you are in EARS major, this class may not be worthwhile for you, as more than half your time will be spent learning the intricate features of an obscure piece of software. The class also had a two week final project where we worked in groups/individually to use remote sensing software to do a study on a remote sensing question of interest to us. Overall the project wasn't bad, but it did take a fair amount of time as we were required to give three presentations -- a proposal, progress report, and final presentation. Professor: Professor Hawley is a good professor overall. He lectures quite well and is able to keep the material interesting. He often stops and asks for question. Probably the biggest issue with the lecture is that for the second half of the class after the midterm/problem set were finished, we were not assessed on the material covered in the lecture and thus there was little incentive to pay close attention and learn it. The professor was also a bit difficult to get in touch with since he made it clear he does not check his email over the weekend.\""

Both Xun and McKeon are extremely available to answer questions or talk through lab/content struggles.

After the final, you and your group spend the rest of the time working on a term project to present during Week 10.

And the prof is very understanding, and his sense of humor is unexpected and refreshing. The final project is a lot of work, but it's really interesting to put all of the things you've learned to the test; you're given the last few weeks of the term just to focus on the project, and you become really close to your group members, which is always fun.

The reading was inconsistent (2 or 3 interesting articles), but some of it was tedious and mostly based on one specific topic- the gender tensions and injustices. The final was a joke for how hard it was with no time to complete it and the final project was a joke for how stupidly easy and time-consuming it was.

Our class was universally liberal (or at least it seemed that way probably bc if anyone felt differently they'd be too scared to voice it) which I generally liked because I am as well, but some of the readings frustrated me a bit because they're all of the same exact opinion (essentially that the government/ice/border patrol is evil in placing any restrictions on who/how many can enter the US, and that immigrants are the poor victims that we should pity). Again, I generally agree with this, but some of the readings took it pretty far and I wished we could talk from a more middle-of-the road place. Anyway, the class was overall not too much work- do the readings b/c you have to write short responses on them for each class, there's one short response paper you write on a book you have to read, and then a final research paper (~12-14 pages). There are also \"quizzes\" (I think 5?) every couple classes on what we've been learning which he frames as super easy reading checks but beware!! They're NOT. It's 15 points per quiz and the 5 of them make up 40% of your grade and he does not go easy on you.... he'll take off a point here and there in your short answer responses to the 3 questions he asks and all of a sudden you're at a 12/15 and that actually really hurts your grade. Definitely prep a lot and don't take them lightly.\"",

He also mixes in other types of media (New York Times articles, the Sopranos, films, and such) to keep the class interesting. And, every so often, he would say something in class that would stick with you... that you find yourself reflecting on later that day, something that you just had to catch him later in his office hours to discuss, talk over with your friends at dinner, or Google because it just really made you think. Even at Dartmouth, those moments don't come often enough, but you'll find them abundant in this class. The class has two midterm in-class essay exams and a final in the same format, plus a group poster presentation on the topic of your choice. Not too much work, although... write FAST on the midterms. He also summarizes the important things in the reading very well in class, so if you're having a tough week, there's really little need to actually do the readings.

However, it was NOT an open discussion. If a student voiced a slightly conservative, or in any way dissenting, opinion on a subject they were promptly shut down. Professor Mollett made her social, economic and political leanings very clear and while that was good for me because I agreed with her, many students didn't feel comfortable participating in class because they would get totally and completely told off if they said something that was perceived as insensitive or conservative. So just be aware... The in-class essays were useless and boring. It was basically designed to see if you had read by asking you to regurgitate the theme of each reading. I didn't read everything but crammed for the essays and did fine. The only hard work was the final essay which was co-authored (SO difficult to do). The presentations that everyone had to do were incredibly boring and I was often tempted to skip class so as to avoid hearing them. I wish the professor lectured more.

From lectures one day, to class discussions the next, to in-class movies, to student presentations, there's really no consistency. This made for some difficulty in understanding the direction of the course. The lectures are great -- Davidson really knows what he's talking about, and he crams a lot of interesting material into them. The readings were usually pretty good about helping to inform the lectures, except for some readings which were overly theoretical and extraordinarily dense. That being said, Davidson doesn't really present dissenting viewpoints from the general Marxist thesis, so if you have a problem with that you will probably be very frustrated with the class. The discussions were a waste of time. He divides the class into small groups to talk about the readings, and then brings you together as a big group to talk about the same things. It is a big waste of time. I would have much rather gotten additional lectures and learned more, rather than hear other students complain about how they're libertarians and they didn't agree with the readings. The assignments are pretty interesting, especially the photo essay project at the end, although it was very frustrating to have to sit through four days of watching other students present their photo projects, most of which weren't very well done. The requirements are a two-essay in-class midterm (15%), a photo project (25%), a final essay (35%) and participation (25%). The movies he shows are interesting but shouldn't be shown in class, they should be made available in Jones, because additional lectures would have improved the course substantially. On another note, Davidson gave the most amazing midterm review session lecture ever, it was very thorough and helpful in bringing all the material together. So overall, the material and the course is interesting, and I recommend taking it if you can get through boring class discussions and student presentations.\""

He will deliver some interesting lines that really make you think, but their cohesive relevance, and that of the course, is not particularly clear.

Domosh LOVES to talk (and talk and talk and talk and talk....), and she literally could probably go through an entire 65 minute lecture without stopping for one moment to take a breath. Her notes on the board end up kind of all over the place, so it's important to keep track of what she's saying, because whatever she says in lecture ends up being way more important than any of the readings. However, what she lectures about is generally interesting, and she loves to get students involved by giving random people various jobs/titles within the city that she's currently describing.

Most of the articles are from very specific journals, which would usually take and extra 10-15 minutes just to find and get downloaded onto my computer. Little incentive to do the reading? You betcha... That is...until you take the midterm, and realize you're pretty much screwed on his tests no matter what you do. I studied pretty damn long and hard for it, and I was stunned when I got the exam. He told us to focus on concepts and ideas, but he tested us on strange acronyms and various terms I had never seen during the identification section, and the entire exam was incredibly long for a 65 minute period. I was so excited to take this class, I think that it has potential, but it needs a lot of improvement.\"",

Freidberg is clearly an expert in the field, having written one of the books that you read for the course, and if you've ever taken anything with her before, it's very standard to how she does her other classes. She's obviously extremely smart, and she's generally a good lecturer, but until you get to know her a little bit better (and this didn't happen for me until halfway through this course -- and it's the second one I've taken with her), she can seem pretty aloof/unfriendly outside of class. However, she's a very good, organized professor -- you'll never be confused on exactly what she's looking for in her assignments, and she's ridiculously fast on blitz in responding to questions -- like blitzing me back within 30 seconds at 1 am. There's really no surprises, either, with the exams or the papers -- they're generally straightforward, and the grading is pretty consistent. We went on two field trips during the course -- one to the Organic Farm and another to a local dairy farm or a local CSA farm, both of which were really interesting/fun. There's a lot of reading overall, some of it being pretty dense, but you only really need to skim it to get a general understanding, as you just end up discussing them in class as a group. Overall, if you have any interest in the food system, take this course. It's a very classic geography class, exploring the topic from a wide variety of perspectives, with everything from growing gourmet produce in Africa for Euoprean consumers to the farm bill to fast food and obesity. The final research paper definitely takes a while, so don't BS your research proposal when it's due way earlier in the term -- Freidberg is spot on when she tells you if your proposal is likely to work or not (and whether you'll drive yourself nuts trying to write a paper on an obscure topic). It'll be worth your while to really think about your topic and do a good job on it -- believe me.\"",

Most of the material was in the form of case studies, drawing on information from in our backyards (SE US, Pacific Northwest, Eastern seaboard, etc. to China, India, Bangladesh, the Zambezi River basin, Cochabamba, Bolivia, and many others. Generally there were 3-4 articles/class, and for a 12... that's a lot when they are generally 15 page PDFs (or longer). And while you don't have to read all of them per say, you do have to write at least 10 reading responses on the readings which tend to be lengthy (1/2-1 page per reading) and the essays require you to cite at least one reading from the first half of the course, and then the second part of the course. There is also an 8-10 page research paper. The readings can also be a little redundant... however, I would definitely still take the course again. Professor Fox is a fantastic instructor, very knowledgeable and obviously passionate about the subject matter.

For the essays: work hard, don't be lazy, they are not graded easily but if you put in the effort it will definitely pay off. She also offers extra credit, which from what I have seen is fairly rare.

I often doubted I was receiving a fair look at the spectrum of perspectives. Being as the class is populated with geography and environmental science majors, few challenges come from the students, and in fact Fox seemed almost surprised that students might not accept her view in most cases. The grading isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard, but really frustrating. Reading responses, think middle school book reports, comprise something like ten percent of your grade, so you are forced to do the vast majority of the reading despite the fact that most of it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary for anything else, or especially interesting. A midterm and final paper comprise much of your grade. You are forced to use many of the assigned readings as sources, but are asked NOT to do any additional research. Its fairly easy to get a good grade regurgitating class themes, but the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correct\u00e2\u20ac\u009d answers is finite and even disagreeable, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to follow you own curiosities or interests.\"",

We discussed reading from a feminist, Malthusian, anti-malthusian, holistic, and environmental perspective to understand the various techniques used to solve things like AIDS, environmental degradation and natural disasters. The group project at the end allowed us to branch away from the class, while still using the arguments and theories we learned.

After taking the class, though, I felt much more educated and able to talk intelligently about overpopulation, environmental conservation, and disease. I'm fine with Professor Fox for the most part. My only complaints are that the paper questions (3 8-pagers, 2 smaller papers in the term) were incredibly vague. I wonder how can I answer a question that it takes the professor a page to ask in only 8 pages. In addition, Professor Fox's personal perspective on every issue (many politically charged) is overtly perceptible in class. Her perspective may be right, and I agree with it on many counts, I just think it would have been nice to hear other ideas presented seriously.

Professor Fox structures the class so that in order to do well you need to do basically all the readings and come to class everyday (she does occassionally take attendance and factors that into your grade). However, based on the amount of reading and papers assigned, doing all the work is incredibly time consuming. I've never had a class with so many paper assignments. Also, with the exception of the group project, the papers are annoyingly designed to determine whether or not you did the readings instead of allowing you to actually answer important questions. As a result, I felt the numerous smaller papers were just assigned to penalize people who weren't doing the work, not helping anyone learn. I really enjoyed the group project because we were able to choose our own topics and explore them, not reiterate the course material. I did feel it was unfair to have such a large group project and research paper towards the end of the course (there were many smaller papers before that) in addition to a final paper due just a few days later. I found myself spending a disproportate amount of time on this class thoughout the entire term.

There is a huge amount of reading, though, and some of them got very dense. However, if you just spent a couple hours skimming over the reading ahead of time you were fine. Professor Fox would lecture on the readings in class, but she never summarized them very much but rather supplemented them with further information. I loved this class! I was so disappointed to find out that Professor Fox is a visiting professor--but if this class is ever offered again, I wholeheartedly would recommend it to anyone!\""

His lectures can be rather intimidating, though, because they often involve writing rather crazily all over the blackboard as well as long powerpoint slides with little time to copy notes (and he doesn't post his slides). However, if you should get the general gist of the lecture because of his tendency to repeat himself, and if you note a couple of specifics, especially about specific authors/ideas that he repeats, you will be fine.

The course is largely group work since you work with your groups on different qualitative research methods throughout the course that build up to a final research proposal at the end of the term. You have to keep a journal where you just reflect on things you learned in class every week and that is graded. The final besides the proposal is a paper where you reflect on what you learned the whole course.

There were three papers (4 pages, 7-9 pages, 10-12 pages), weekly readings (probably 5-10 articles per week), weekly reading responses (4 pages each), and a 12 min. presentation at the end of the class. So yes, the workload is heavy - there is a lot of reading, and a lot of writing. The readings are often case-studies that deal with tourism all across the globe, and the responses are like first-draft essays. So going into this course, expect that you're going to work - but it will be worth it. The readings really reinforce the ideas and concepts, and unlike my writing 5 course, I actually felt that my writing improved from start to finish (probably due to the sheer amount of it), and that I was dealing with a topic that actually mattered (we often grappled with solutions to problems such as world poverty). The classes were all discussion based, and Professor Fox did a great job facilitating them. She clearly knows her topic, and is very well informed about global events. The essays are pretty open-ended, and aren't all that difficult. The final paper is a research project on a tourism topic of your choice (e.g. volunteer tourism, retirement tourism, dark tourism, poorism, etc.). So yes, this class is hard, to put it simply. But, if you're willing to put in the work, you're going to see the rewards. Professor Fox is very helpful, and isn't going to hang you out to dry. With all that said, I'd recommend taking this class.

It gives the impression that the majority of the course is spent discussing the controversies surrounding the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the World Trade Center Memorial. This was not at all the case: we spent at most two-and-a-half weeks on these two memorials. Half the course was dedicated to tracing the historical development of the Western conception of memory, beginning with Plato and his Theory of the Forms and ending with the social memory theories of Emile Durkheim and Maurice Halbwachs. Another quarter or so was spent studying theories derived from the work of Durkheim and Halbwachs that dealt specifically with monuments and memorials. It was only in the last quarter of the course that we began the case studies. For me, however, this emphasis on theory was a pleasant surprise and was what made the course worth taking. Social memory theory was radically different from anything I had encountered before, and I found it fascinating. Although a few of the readings really were quite dull, on the whole they were excellent. The exerpt we read from Durkheim, in particular, was the most brilliant, provocative, and frightening piece of thought I had ever come across. Professor Forest is a very effective lecturer, although he doesn't do much lecturing in this course since it is a seminar. He does a very good job critiquing papers: his comments on my papers were always very insightful and probably helped me more than anything else in understanding the material. This course requires quite a large amount of work. I easily read over 1000 pages and wrote over 60 during the term. Whether or not that is more or less work than a typical Dartmouth course, I don't know. It's not overwhelming though. And the lasr paper of the term, the research paper, is a whole lot of fun to write.\"",

She's incredibly enthusiastic, perky, hyper, etc. - literally, I don't know where she gets all of her energy, especially given that it was a 2A. She was clearly incredibly passionate about our seminar topic; she always told us how much she loved to shop and about all the research she's done on the topic. I found the reading to be interesting - I learned a great deal about why we buy the things we buy, why companies advertise in the ways they do, and a great deal about the psychology behind shopping, both domestically and within other countries. It's not a fluff class by any means; don't go into it with that impression. As far as work goes, we had about 100-200 pages to read for every class, and we had to blitz her three discussion questions at least 2 hours before each class - not a big deal. We had to write two, 1,250 word papers and then a 12-page final research paper. The two smaller papers were no big deal; the final research paper was kind of a pain, but we basically got to choose our own topics, so it wasn't so bad. One of the coolest things we did was a field trip to the shopping area in West Leb towards the end of the course. We had to go to Wal-Mart, Borders, Price Chopper, and Pier 1 and evaluate the \"ethnic marketing\" present within each of the stores - and then we went to Chili's afterwards to talk about it. I found Domosh to be really nice and caring towards us; for example, she made the research paper due the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break so that it wouldn't be \"hanging over our heads during the break,\" as she put it. She was really friendly and approachable, and to top if off, we had a pizza party w/ pizza from Ramunto's on the last day of class - at her suggestion! If you don't want a boring seminar or have any interest in shopping at all, take this with Domosh.\"",

It's about self-identity, discourses of gender and race and sexuality, constructs of public space, etc. These are all problems I would have with the Geography dep't in general, I guess -- Domosh is radically liberal (I say that as a liberal democrat) with inflexible views and a heavy dose of intolerance toward differing opinions. She is quick to point out how well published and respected she is, talks about herself at length, rambles, and avoids students' questions. Her essay assignments were truly ridiculous: she states at the top what she wants you to prove, briefly outlines how we should prove it, and then expects 14 nearly identical papers. (Theses are, in fact, discouraged.) Grading is very subjective -- I ended up with a good grade, as did most in the class, but that's just because I wrote what she told me to write in class. The material is somewhat interesting, some readings are very interesting, but the weak professor really destroys this class. A few people in the class liked Domosh, most found her pretty annoying, and some of us found her intolerable. Good luck with the seminar if you take it.\"",

We did a ton of different readings but I couldn't really figure out what she was tying it all back to. Pretty unsatisfying and uninteresting, and definitely discouraged me from taking more geography classes.\"",

The reason for this is Mona - she's casual, she talks A LOT, and she can be gratingly cheerful. If you prefer professors with a more professional demeanor, or a seminar class that involves a professor talking less than 3/4 of the time, don't take a class with her. If you're more laid-back or are genuinely interested in the subject she's teaching though, go for it.\"",

The readings were dry at best, and somehow the content of the readings seemed to morph during in-class discussion. It also seemed really \"high school\" because Professor Domosh really did lecture the entire time, in what she claimed was a discussion-based class. I think compared to what could have been done with the class, it sub-par. However, if you're used to high school courses it was pretty much a breeze. Looking back now, it wasn't representative of a typical Dartmouth class, but it definitely wasn't horrible. Not a bad choice, but i know some people who had amazing seminars.\""

However, this class felt like two major sprints (one right before the midterm, and another right before the final). Freidberg assigned a ton of readings every meeting, but not a lot of writing up discussion posts/short responses to motivate you to actually do them. Instead, you maintain a long-term research journal on a Sustainable Development Goal and country of your choice. I enjoyed the research journal because there was a lot of freedom to explore my topic, but definitely make sure you pace yourself and don't fall behind on your entries. I liked that this class never had timed quizzes or exams - it's one of those that if you put in the work, you'll succeed. However, like previous reviewers, Freidberg did not give very helpful feedback.

Our midterm feedback consisted of only curt, one-to-two words like \"no,\" \"not really,\" or \"confusing\" with little explanation. I attended office hours with her frequently but she never seemed to give too much care to get to know other students besides the 3-4 that spoke frequently.

But, there were a lot of freshman that complained about the reading load. I would say it is pretty standard for a geography class or any social sciences class. There were 3 pop quizzes throughout the term that were pretty tough - I got a zero on one after doing the reading. But, you can calculate when the quizzes will be so you don't need to heavily do the reading for every class. With Freidberg, she used the x-hour every week which was a drag. The midterm was okay - just take good notes in class and be familiar with the key readings. The main project is journal. My major complaint with this is that you don't get much feedback on each of your entries (8 throughout the term) so you don't really know how you're being graded. An odd assignment with not a lot of direction to me. There is also a summary essay on your journal posts, as well as a take home final essay. The work piles up towards the end of the term if you are behind on your journal, as most of us are. As a whole I liked this class, but I don't think it't for everyone. Freidberg is a unique character but tries to keep class lively. Definitely NOT a layup, but if you're interested in development this is a good starter class.

She gives 3 random quizzes each term, and expects you to read material that is way beyond the scope of anything you have learnt in class. She also gives a research project that requires 8-12 entries; each entry is like writing a paper in writing 5 - and this is while having to study for the midterm! I easily spent 15-20 hours a week on this class and had nothing to show for it. Honestly resent taking the class.

I don't know how I did, but it better have been half decently i swear it for all the studying I put in. Now for the greenhouse gases.. oh wow. IN the second to last week, they force you to do student presentations on different elements of greenhouse gases... and then expect that your notes on greenhouse gases is enough just in case you get the question on the test. Now keep in mind these were student presentations. Much of the information given by the different groups contradicted one another. Whoa. Lets try something new for size, the research paper. START THE PAPER EARLY AND OFTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my god, its a royal pain the butt to do original research. It truly is. You have to gather climate data on your own (that's a true pain in the arse). I started in earnest in the first month of february and I'm glad I did. Your original idea might not work out (as mine didn't). Its long and tedious. And you also have the second midterm with contest with during the final few weeks. Let me just add that Conkey is lovely... and so is Bruce (TA). Conkey couldn't really give a lecture to save a life. Bruce is a riot in the classroom. He really knows how to connect. He also is a MAJOR, I REPEAT MAJOR asset when working on the term paper. But overall, unless you want to give yourself an ulcer, stay away. Just stay away. STAY AWAY.\"",

A pretty easy SCI credit...pretty boring too.\"",

So I went into it with an open mind, hoping for the best... However, unfortunately, the class was mediocre, at best, and boring and frustrating the majority of the time. Conkey and her TA sidekick, Bruce, are both incredibly nice/friendly/willing to help, and it really pained me to see such nice people be such awful, awful professors. Conkey and Bruce split up the lecturing, so each did about half. In general, the course was all over the place and really lacked organization -- the first 2/3 of the course was all just about the basics of weather and the atmosphere -- I felt like the class would have been better titled \"Intro to Weather\", and it wasn't until the last 1/3 of the class that we actually started to talk about climate change. Even when we did talk about climate change, it was mostly from a very technical perspective -- i.e. the effects of aerosols, how ozone is formed/destroyed, etc. -- I felt like it seriously lacked an anthropogenic perspective as to how humans actually impacted the climate. I found that my lecture notes were all over the place -- sometimes they would use PowerPoint, sometimes they wouldn't, and I never had any idea as to what was and wasn't important when it came time to study for the midterms. The first final wasn't bad at all, but the second one was significantly more difficult and much more picky in its questions, which was really annoying. Furthermore, lecture was SUPER boring most of the time. Conkey, while nice, is soporific, and while Bruce was definitely better, I never felt like I was really all that engaged with the material we were learning about. The course also involved a pretty major final research paper, which took WAY longer than I anticipated (you have to gather primary source data and then do your own analysis of it), so don't wait until the last minute to get working on it -- believe me, you'll be glad you did. I got the impression that the course wasn't inherently bad by its nature, but Conkey herself just cannot get it together to make a good class -- so I have a feeling that regardless of what it is that she's teaching, it's never going to be good. And it's a shame, too, because she is the nicest person ever... Admittedly, she's kind of hard to avoid if you're a Geog major, but wait to take one of the 30's courses with Magilligan or someone else -- you'll be glad you did. And if you're just looking for an SCI distrib, STAY AWAY -- there are WAY better ways to do that than by taking Geog 5.\"",
            "review 8: \"08W with Laura Conkey: I have two serious qualms with this course. First, Conkey is boring as hell. Her life's work consists of studying tree-rings, and it shows. There are also some gaping holes in her understanding of climatology and geology. For the most part, she can handle herself, but it is obvious that this is not her specialty. Second, the final was a HORRIBLE assessment of our understanding of the course material. She took all the material since the first mid-term and divided it up into six climate \"forcings\" like earth-sun geometry, greenhouse gases, aerosols, and so on. When she passed out the exams, she RANDOMLY assigned ONE of those topics to each person and asked us to write an in-depth essay. I'll admit, I received ozone (probably the hardest of the lot) and had very little to say about it. I had spent dozens of hours studying ENSO, aerosol-albedo interactions, greenhouse gases, and Milankovitch Cycles. I was able to express NONE of that knowledge on the final, nor anywhere else in the course. I don't know if she'll pull this again, but I think several of us wrote fiery complaints on the in-class course assessment, so pray that she doesn't. On to the best part of the course: Bruce. Nobody's sure exactly who Bruce Brough is (he's not a professor or graduate student) but he essentially functioned as the TA for this course. Occasionally, Conkey would let him teach a lecture, and all of a sudden, the material would come alive. He is one of those hilarious, informed, prepared, energetic, perfectly paced lecturers that you could listen to all day long. I swear, the guy made learning about Hadley-cell circulation semi-orgasmic. If this man EVER teaches a course at Dartmouth, I don't care what it is, you should be first in line. Overall, this course is very pertinent and the material has the potential to be interesting, but much of that is lost on Conkey. The readings are sometimes helpful but often needlessly technical. If you take this course, for the love of god, beware idiotic test formats. Make sure you understand what is going to be expected of you before you study for countless hours like I did.\"",

A large portion of the class had already taken AP Environmental Science (or were Geog majors and knew all this stuff already), and thus already knew the material -- but it was uphill for everyone else.

When students ask a question, she will often think for a minute, give an answer, and then change it. This might leave you really confused. She clearly knows the material but she doesn't seem to have a great deal of confidence which, after a while, makes you question everything she says. She will sometimes in lecture say something that is the exact opposite of what is correct and then apologize for messing up. She would probably be a great professor when teaching a class in her specialty but not this general intro class. The material itself seemed generally intersting but the lectures often managed to put me to sleep-- not good in a class where on any given day 12 people would show up. The beginning and ending parts of the class were the most interesting, with the material during the middle 4 weeks fairly dull.

I spoke 1-2 times per class and got an 8.5/10 for participation so I guess you have to speak a lot to do well. Like the 18W person said, you are expected to learn the info before class so you can spend class time discussing it and some people ask some really extra questions to get participation points.

The worst part of the class is that the teachers don't even teach you. All the powerpoints are online and you are expected before class to have done your readings and read and take notes on the powerpoint. Then you spend the entire rest of class asking questions. The participation emphasis is terrible. The TA takes down how many times you participate and that makes it into a competition. Regardless of if you actually have a good question or not, you have to try and ask one or your grade will seriously suffer. The classes also feel like a lifetime because of this.

On both the midterm essay and the final paper, you have to write a 7-9 page paper on some general topic incorporating all of the readings we've done throughout the term (which was probably around 30-40 for each one), which drove me crazy. It's nearly impossible to fit all of those into an essay of that length, and instead of doing any sort of independent analysis, I felt like I focused my entire essay on trying to squeeze a quotation from each the articles into the paper and have it all make sense.
