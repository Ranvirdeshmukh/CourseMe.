            "review 1: \"23W with Maura Doyle: I took this class during 23W after dropping Math3 in the fall and it was SO MUCH better. The content is relatively easy (much easier compared to math3) but also more interesting because it's also taught in a way that applies different economic concepts (like a taster of ECON21). I found myself doing little to no work throughout the term beyond mandatory assignments (which were literally like one question a week and mostly graded on completion) but still did well in the class. Her tests are also super manageable, with no tricks or anything funky, and she would drop your lowest test score and allow a cheat sheet on every single one of them. Do the problem sets she assigns and you will do fine in this class\"",
            "review 2: \"23W with Maura Doyle: Doyle is an excellent prof, she is always on top of the material and ensures that you grasp onto what she is saying. She really dumbs it down. Taking this just after math 1 makes it a lot easier given that the first few weeks are basically revising math 1 material. If you've some calculus experience, the first few weeks can feel frustratingly slow as prof Doyle is trying to get everyone up to speed but it sure does get better later. The term project is very interesting and gives you a good introduction into economics research work. Also, prof Doyle tries to ensure that the project doesn't become overly strenuous, but giving good effort to it directly translates to better grades. The whole term is distributed into 9 modules making it very structured and well-organized. It just allows you to keep a track of everything new that you're learning. Prof Doyle puts immense effort in covering the gaps in knowledge by making lecture videos, sending out notes, psets etc. All in all, you will have a good time taking the course if you're even vaguely interested in the field.\"",
            "review 3: \"23W with Maura Doyle: TAKE THIS CLASS!!! If you are an Econ major, Econ 3 is 100% better than math 3. Doyle is super nice and always willing to help. The class is well-structures and she explains concepts well. The class starts with algebra and then moves into calculus, which makes the couple of weeks relatively easy. You are allowed 1 cheat sheet for each quiz and 2 for the final. There is a final project that is only 2 pages long and she drops the lowest quiz grade. Totally recommend!\"",
            "review 4: \"23W with Maura Doyle: I think this class is def worth taking, but don't think you're catching a break from Math 3. Since we didnt go over things that are irrelevant in econ (like trig), we were able to get through a LOT more material, which just made the class really overwhelming personally. She is a great person and will work with you, but I think it is easy to assume the exams will be easy since the homework is completion and literally like 1 problem per week.\"",

Class is super straightforward and Doyle is super super nice. As for whether or not it's a layup, while course content is definitely graspable, all math requires practice and I would make sure that you are putting enough time to master the concepts and material before quizzes and final. Doyle's p-sets are excellent for practice and she also provides the answer key. Quiz questions often came directly from them and were altered just a tiny bit.\"",
            "review 6: \"22W with Maura Doyle: Absolutely loved this class. Took basically no calculus in high school and I\u2019ve always been scared of the math part of econ but this class made me feel so much more confident about my calc skills. I also love how well organised everything was on canvas. There are basically three quizzes (lowest quiz grade is dropped), weekly assignments graded for completion, a final, and a short final project. The quizzes are based on what she teaches during lectures, and if you fully understand the material and go through the problem set answers she gives for each module, you should be totally fine. The final was pretty similar to the three quizzes. The project was really straightforward and simple. Also helps that Professor Doyle is literally an absolute sweetheart. Wouldn\u2019t really say it\u2019s a layup but it\u2019s a super manageable amount of work. Would totally recommend this class.\"",

            "review 8: \"22W with Maura Doyle: Course organization was super effective and, likely, a lot better than Math3. The grade is comprised of completion assignments and 3 midterm quizzes where the lowest grade gets dropped. The first exam or two were often repeats of Math1 concepts with Econ examples. If you\u2019re an Econ major struggling with math, definitely take this course. Doyle herself is a very straight forward professor, however, she does enforce the B+ median and does weed out her class favorites. She can be difficult to deal with sometimes but is very good in her flexibility for office hours. However, she often just explains her answer key, so you\u2019re better off with YouTube. TA wasn\u2019t particularly helpful either, especially since the TA was only virtual and didn\u2019t attend class.\""

As with all the 60-level econ courses, the main assignment was writing your own empirical paper (max 15 pages double spaced). While it can be intimidating at first having to come up with a topic, find the data, analyze it, and write up everything, Professor Pavcnik does a great job spreading the work out over the term and gives great feedback on the intermediate steps for the paper project. The class is very front-loaded with work in the term which is honestly a good balance since you'll need more time near the end to work on all the details of your paper. The required readings (economic journal papers) were interesting and the student-led class discussions were a valuable way to gain exposure to what economics papers look like and how you can design and improve your paper. Professor Pavcnik is really nice and encouraging and she's very available outside of class for office hours. I would highly recommend taking Econ 69 with Pavcnik.\""

            "review 1: \"23W with Treb Allen: This class is fantastic. Professor Allen is excellent - incredibly knowledgable, available to students, enthusiastic about the material, understanding of conflicts, and just generally a cool guy. The class was taught as a 10A and a 2A, with Tuesday classes being an in depth discussion of an interesting, recent paper on international economics, which cover a variety of topics throughout the term, that all the students read beforehand and make a discussion post about. One student a week leads the class discussion by making a slideshow about the paper, which you make with the person presenting the same paper in the other section so it is a very manageable amount of work (and you only do it once during the term). Thursdays are split, with the first week being an in depth review of econ research, the next few being refreshers on stata, and the last few being dedicated office hours to work on your final paper. The majority of the term is spent writing a research paper on whatever topic you would like (it should be vaguely international economics based, but he said you can kinda pick anything). There are weekly progress checkpoints due (e.g. one week you turn in your literature review, another you turn in the data set you compiled, another is tables and figures, etc) which make the final paper very doable and make sure that you are on progress the whole term (Allen gives frequent and very helpful feedback, both over canvas and in office hours). At the end of the term you turn in a (max) 15 page paper not counting tables and figures, which you also make a slideshow on and present to the class the week before it is due. Department sets the class at an A- median but I think you would have to try pretty hard to get below that. Grading is 25% checkpoints for the paper, 25% the paper itself, 25% Tuesday class presentation, and 25% class participation (13% in class, 12% on weekly discussion posts). I know the reviews for Econ 29 are bad, but that class is worth it to be able to take this class later. Plus 39 is really good so 2/3 of the track is great. All in all - managable and interesting work, very good professor, strongly recommend this as a final econ class.\""

In fact, I left this class with a wonderful paper that I am excited to use as a writing sample during job interviews. The workload is definitely heavy, and the grades are quite low on the first few empirical paper deliverables, but the median evens out by the end of the course.

Prof Anderson is not great at guiding students through the paper -- she only gave one or two pieces of feedback for each deliverable, and they often were very broad comments (not more nitpicky things like what type of analyses to run, or what variables to control for).

Professor Anderson always delivers great insight and brings a very funny dry sense of humor. I disagree with the other review regarding Professor Anderson's feedback. She is by far the most accessible professor I have ever had at Dartmouth \u2014 she keeps an open calendar with time slots for students every day. I met with her multiple times throughout the term. During appointments, I found her to be extremely resourceful, both regarding larger elements of my paper as well as smaller details.

He brings in a ton of Dartmouth grads working in various parts of the finance industry to talk about their experiences and what they've done with their careers. Sacerdote really cares about the student experience here and frequently invites people to the skiway, lunch, etc. The paper is a bit of a burner at the end. Other 60-level courses have frequent deadlines that keep you working on your paper. This year, the 66 paper was due before other 60-level courses, creating a crazy scramble for everyone to finish. I think the tradeoff was easily worth it; I would rather have learned the cool things I learned in class and had a few tough days before the paper was due instead of focusing on menial tasks in class throughout the term. Sacerdote is very generous compared to other profs and grants a lot to time to students. Definitely go to office hours if you are thinking of a paper topic etc.\"",

The prof is nice and engaging, and likes to discuss current events which is amazing (sometimes at the expense of student presentations). He has a lot of office hour openings and he responds quickly to emails. He is eager to talk to students. We played a stock picking game which is really fun (he ended up in last place because of Gamestop). Managed to have the course in person. The assignmentsare really easy and really chill, sometimes all he asks is you write in the box that you talked to him about it in office hours. For the class readings, just paste two or three sentences from the paper's abstract and you will get full points for the reading posts. I would regularly post joke questions and still get full credit. However, the final paper does drag the experience down. Specifically, the paper requires some ability to manipulate STATA. The TA's were like stars in the sky, unreachable and useless. None of them knew finance, or STATA really. I would ask them how to do basic stuff and they had no idea what to do. As a result, the professor is inundated with students needing help. Even if you arrive early, his office hours will be full of people, many asking stupid questions (somone did not know how to divide numbers in STATA). His health visibly declined during these office hours. However, you have no choice but beg him for help. For the final paper, you have to put together a unique data set and do several regressions. However, students have never been trained to do such things, Econ 20's STATA tutorial is a joke. So, you get stuck and need help. You wait in line with ten other students for three hours, then the prof has to go home and you don't even have your question answered. Also, beware that the prof's opinion of your paper can change all the time. He may say it is an interesting topic, but then look at your data and regressiosn and sigh saying that unfortunately it did not turn out as interesting as he had thought. Now you have an A-.

There's like three psets about the graph-making software he uses (takes like 2-3 hours each time) and online Q&A after each presentation (takes like an hour at most). By the way, you work with one single partner on all this the entire term, so you have to take this class with a friend or you risk a terrible term lol. Lectures are pretty much useless, but whatever. Honestly I'd say good class, worth taking.\"",

He is miserable to listen to ramble about the same 2 topics non-stop during class while he tries to seem caring but spends half the time bragging about himself and spewing meaningless and patronizing platitudes. At least when other econ profs have been self important they aren't pretending otherwise which makes it much less annoying. Levin will talk over you non-stop in office hours and never let you get out a question because he is too busy correcting you after 3 words. He admits his grades are arbitrary because he doesn't think they matter but will still give a B+ median despite being tenured and not having any reason to worry about the econ department being annoyed. He prepares nothing for class and just talks about the FED being bad at communicating everyday. You will fully learn 0 in this class and be so very annoyed by every second of it. Also, it can be much more work than other people have said if you want to try and comply with some of his pretty pointless guidelines for presentations and Q&A . Trying to please him will take way way too many hours of work (and the extra effort probably won't get you anywhere anyways). Find another econ class. Levin is much to miserable.\"",

The grades are more arbitrary in that they are primarily based on handouts you create with a partner, but I found learning to structure graphs in eViews for them was a more practical skill than memorizing like you would for a typical econ class test.

I learned absolutely nothing which is disappointing because I was really excited beginning of the term. He does not reward original thought or effort to do anything above the bare minimum. People in this class were also dumb af asking stupid questions and making just simply wrong agreements and he would give them a higher grade than people who know what they were talking about because he thinks that is \"jargon and inaccessible to the general public\".

The other two-thirds is lecture style, but you get lectured on just about everything other than monetary policy. Levin is clear about his dislike for The Fed and communicates that just about everyday, but doesn't actually teach you about anything that they do. Levin stresses that grades are not important but yet says that he must stick to the B+ median. His grades are arbitrary and its very hard to communicate with him in person.

The hardest part of the course was definitely the problem sets. If you could understand them, you were fine.\"",

Not the best way to learn... On the other hand, he's very responsive to students during class and was incredibly flexible with the course. The students had a lot of say in how it was run.\""

If you want to get by in your required 40-level course senior spring without reading the material too carefully or putting too much effort into your paper, it may be easier to do so in Sacerdote's section although it is certainly possible in both.

It's a culminating experience for the major, so you likely only have a choice between this class and whatever the culminating experience is for your other \"track.\" Thus, I don't really know what to tell you. What I *can* tell you is that this course truly lives up to its name as a \"culminating experience.\" It honestly was the most fitting conclusion I could have picked for my economics major at Dartmouth. I plan on applying to business school within 4-6 years, so I wasn't in it as much for the academic study itself as I was for the fact that there is no \"(pre-)business\" track open to Dartmouth undergrads. Having said this however, this course really gave everyone a chance to explore a variety of different industries, and examine some of the business practices involved. Since you have to have taken 25 to get into this course, I will assume you're proficient enough in the subject material to get by; be aware that you are expected to be familiar with a good deal from 25 if you hope to succeed. For a course supposedly geared towards writing a mini-thesis (as ECON culminating experiences are intended to be), a full 35% of our grade came from 3 take-home midterms, which was a tad unsavory given my expectations. More to the point, Prof. Scott is just as picky and tough a grader as he was in 25, and the exams are not exactly easy. I basically don't know what to say about this course as a matter of opinion. If you really enjoyed ECON 25, then by all means, take this as your culminating experience. If you're a little more on-the-fence, I don't know how to advise you vs. another culminating experience. My only substantive advice is to use your experiences from ECON 25 as your guide, and draw your own conclusions about whether or not you wish to devote a term writing a paper studying some element of IO in excrutiating detail.\"",

Pros: (1) Manageable workload. You get a lot of work around the 2 midterms, and the paper is due a few days before the second midterm so expect a lot of work for those 2 weeks. Other than that, no finals, you are done in week 9 and the other week you just need to come to class. (2) Prof. Staiger is very sweet and understanding. He is incredibly patient and will explain everything to you again if you show up to his office hours. There are a few people in my class who would keep asking basic questions (that he literally just covered 5 mins before) and he always stops to answer them. He also holds review sessions for the midterms and paper so you get a lot of guidance during the way. (3) He teaches really slow, and he always makes sure the topic he covers follow a logical order -- which makes it easier to connect the dots and study. Overall sweet man who cares a lot about what he teaches and his students. Answers his emails super quickly too -- one time he answered mine in like 10 minutes. Cons: (1) He is an old school teacher and does not record his class or provide a Zoom option -- so you have to go to class and take notes or ask for notes from someone else. That said, he does a great job of explaining, which notes won't suffice. He uses almost all of the X-hours as well, which can be a bummer. (2) Sometimes he has trouble with answering the actual points of the questions and just rambles and repeats what he just said. (3) His exams are particular. I personally did fine on the first midterm, but you really have to understand what he is looking for when he throws out some keywords. Make sure to go over the practice exams and listen to the way he poses issues/questions in class and you will be fine.

He's a really nice guy, and a generally good lecturer -- he kind of laughs at himself here and there throughout his lectures, which are usually pretty interesting, and he uses Google Earth all the time to try and demonstrate various aspects of what he's talking about. I couldn't get over how little work I had to do for the class -- it basically consisted of a midterm, a final, and a final research paper. The midterm and final were incredibly short for an econ class -- if it took you an hour for either of them, that was a really long time. The final research paper took a little while to do (you basically had to look at home values across municipal boundaries and explore what might contribute to the difference in prices), but it wasn't difficult at all, and I think that he graded pretty generously. There were no problem sets, and the readings really weren't all that necessary (he basically explained all of the important stuff in class), although he did like to throw one or two really random, picky questions from the reading on the exams. But honestly, you could get by no problem by just skimming it. To a large extent, the course material didn't feel like an econ class at all -- besides a few basic MC/AC graphs, it basically consisted of geography/history/psych stuff more than anything else.

Much of the research and readings behind the class were done by Fischel himself, so he is certainly an expert on what he teaches. The analysis is only vaguely reminiscent of standard economics- a couple of graphs derived from Econ 1 on AC/MC at most. Otherwise, we listened to Fischel's theories about topics as diverse as why the school calendar is the way it is and how a court ruling in California impacted a statewide property tax proposition.

By far, one of my favorite Economics classes I've taken at Dartmouth because the material is SO interesting! I didn't think Professor Simons was particularly effective at teaching. She kind of has a tough accent to understand sometimes and she definitely makes a substantial amount of mistakes when teaching. The amount of homework Professor Simons assigned was quite a lot - pretty much one textbook chapter every class, and a couple chapters a week from the \"Random Walk Down Wall Street\" book. This book turned out to be very interesting easy-reading but not relevant to your grade at all (she never tested us on the reading). In addition to the reading, there are weekly online quizzes of 25 multiple choice every week which I thought were pretty difficult and take a good hour or two to complete. As well as weekly problem sets (which are NOT collected or graded, but helpful to learning the material). There were 2 Midterms and 1 Final Exam. The questions were a somewhat random mix of questions. Some of which come completely out of the blue. On the final exam there were 2 problems that we had never gone over in class, and never had any similar problems on problem sets or quizzes. Overall, Professor Simons is not a good professor. She doesn't teach effectively, assigns a lot of work, and doesn't test you on relevant material on the tests.

Do yourself a favor: if you find yourself obligated to take econ 36 with Simons, do NOT go to class.

Samwick thinks that he's bringing the material down to the level of the class, but for most of us, he's not even close.

The problem sets were really reasonable and if you did well on them then you were fine for the exams. Samwick does like to be creative on the exams i.e. he wants to see who knows the material and who really knows the material. So you need to make sure that you not only know how to do the problem sets, but really understand the theory behind the application. If you mess up on the problem sets do them again and again until you know exactly what you did wrong and why in terms of theory itself you were wrong. The one thing I would say could be better is office hours. Samwick uses his x hours as office hours or review sessions. I just wish he was free more.

I'd much rather have a range of grades from 40-90 and a well-balanced curve than an easy test where everyone scores in the 80s and 90s and you have to get every single question right to get an A. I didn't do as well as I'd like in this class, and considerably worse than I usually do, but only because I didn't study enough. I did badly on the midterms and then put in the work that I should have been putting in all term right before the final and pulled my grade up. So it's possible, and if I done the work from the beginning, I probably could have gotten an A or an A-. This isn't a course where you can go into a test with a general understanding of the material and expect to do well. You need to know exactly how to do every problem on the problem sets and practice tests by heart. And if you do, you'll get half the test 100% correct, and have to squeeze as many points as you can out of the rest of the questions. But half the points is 50, and then you only have to get another 15 points to get the median (scaled to a B) and if you can get 20, that's pretty much an A. So do the reading on time, start the problems sets before the night before they're due, and you should be fine. There were a bunch of As on every test, and the end of term median was a B+, so really, it's not that bad. And Samwick is a great guy. He's really helpful in office hours, and is animated during lectures and even cracks a few jokes. Most impressive, he handed back the first midterms to each of us sitting in our seats--he had memorized all the names of the students in both sections by the middle of October.

It's known in some circles as the class where the median on the first midterm was 36 (how poetic...). Personally, I am a bit of a finance junkie, so I found the material to be fantastic. The book is really great and you can learn a LOT from it. Samwick's additions to the material - in the form of contemporary Economics papers - are also fantastic. He takes a rigorous approach to the course that I appreciate. Economics at Dartmouth is too light of a discipline; the department has dumbed down the subject too much to cater to the average \"I want to be an I-banker mommy!\" student. In comparisons to other schools, our courses come up short. There is a distinct lack of rigor. Heck, the only math requirement is Math 3! With that in mind, I found it refreshing that Samwick was willing to challenge the students and give them a more complete understanding of the subject. Yes, his tests are hard, but if you go to class and do the problem sets, you will be just fine. It also helps to have a good math background, no matter what the \"Screw addition, you need people skills!\" crowd tells you. It's a very fair, very structured class. There is no confusion, you know exactly what to do at every point and Samwick is very accessible. I don't know why people are complaining. If you want to be challenged, take the class.\"",
            "review 23: \"06W with Andrew Samwick: Solid course. I found the material quite interesting. Samwick's lectures are dry, but tolerable. He has a superb grasp of the subject and is very accessible. There was an average amount of work--reading in the textbook and seven problem sets. The problem sets weren't graded. I liked the way Samwick grades. Two midterms and a final His tests are very hard (medians were around 40%) but there is presumably a curve, so there's plenty of room to seperate yourself at the top if you master the material. He also weights grades so that the final is worth 300 points minus the sum of the two midterms. This rewards people who have done well on the midterms by making the final less important, but it also makes it possible to save themself by acing the final.\"",
            "review 24: \"06W with Andrew Samwick: Well, I have read enough of these reviews and thought it appropriate to contribute to the database by senior year. I am an econ major and taking the 26,36,46 and 29,39 tracks within the major. I had taken econ 26 my sophmore spring and it had been a while since I took finance but that wasn't a problem. The problem was Andrew Samwick. I loved econ 26 - it was one of the most interesting and useful classes at the college. It allows a student to pick up a Wall Street Journal and understand basic financial features such as stocks, bonds, and simple pricing (ie net present value). I took the class with Alan Durell (no longer at the college) and thoroughly enjoyed. When I saw Professor Samwick was teaching Econ36 this winter, I signed up as I both needed the course and had heard good things about the teacher. Samwick runs the Rockefeller Center and works for the federal government (the Council of Economic Advisors I believe). While Samwick is definitely an intelligent guy, the class was simply one of the worst classes I had taken in the department. Samwick is a strange man and talks like Austin Power's Dr. Evil (he claims because he watched too much TV as a child). The format of the class is all powerpoint lectures which are available online so notes are rarely taken. He is available to answer questions during class and does so happily. There were 7 problem sets given throughout the term but none were mandatory (perhaps they should have been). The fault of the class was the testing, however. There are 2 midterms and a final. Students can make up lost points on the final (the class is out of 300 points and the final is worth the weighted average of however many points are left out of 300... if you have a 50% on each test, the final is worth 200/300 points for your entire term grade). This allows you to make up lost points throughout the term but weights the final to virtually your entire grade. Samwick's tests are too difficult for the material he teaches and are not a fair assessment of what one has learned throughout the class. I left each class feeling like I had learned something and understood the subject matter. Yet, his exams said otherwise. I kept with the median of the class for the first 2 exams (I haven't got my final grade yet). The median for the first exam was 34/100 and the second was a 40/100. While the grade will be curved to some degree, many students agreed it was simply demoralazing for the median grade to be failing. The best thing to prepare for the exam was to do the problem sets but they were difficult and were not discussed in class. After spending a term with Samwick, I regret my decision to take the class with him and should have scheduled the class another term. My best advice is to avoid this professor and spare yourself the headache of his testing style. Listening to his droning lecture style was painful (contributing to the low grades) so take the class at your own risk. NOTE - The subject matter in econ36 is not bad at all. It is a lot of advanced pricing models for equity, bonds, options, and all the good stuff from econ26. Just Samwick stinks, period end of story. Good luck.\""

Also the lectures were rather dry and attempts at making the material more interesting (articles from the WSJ, portfolio management project) were kind of dropped halfway through the term. However, I think that DeSantis made a good attempt to make his class interesting and I think he will be more effective in future offerings.

If you have taken your 26 with Kohn, you will be wildly dissapointed with this professor and his lecture style. Professor DeSantis told us on the first day of class, he never had any practical experience on Wall Street, or with using the concepts he was about to teach us in the real world. You could witness this in the lectures as he was not able to answer some basic questions about his topic. As far as material goes, the Efficient Market Hypothesis has been an outdated theory with more and more economists and finance professionals agreeing that Behavioral Finance is a theory that provides for a better explanation of the markets in general. However, due to the fact that the professor is a wild proponent of the EMH, theories that would go against it and which were developed by professionals working in the field were often ignored or ridiculed. Not to mention the fact that most simple theories such as CAPM were taught in a very confusing way. It came to no surprise that over 50% of the class dropped this course throughout the term.

Does he often make mistakes during lectures and writing up exams? Yeah but it is not really as big of a flaw as people make it out to be. Humanity is imperfection and you can actually understand the material better when a flaw is discovered and addressed. One thing I have noticed is that Grant always asks if we have questions towards the end of a section in the lecture but very few actually ask them. The quizzes (30%) are fair but the final (30%) can be quite tough. It was definitely a step up from 22W. However, it was definitely not the hardest exam I\u2019ve taken at Dartmouth or even within the Econ department. The other class components are quite chill: problem sets (10%) which are graded for completion and effort, a group paper (15%), and a group presentation (15%).

He goes over the structure and sample responses in class and the rubrics posted are very transparent about what he is looking for. He is also a very kind and accommodating person in general: he made sure to ask if I needed any extensions or move my presentations to a later date when I informed that I\u2019d miss class for a day due to catching the flu.

            "review 7: \"23W with Matthew Grant: The way that Matthew Grant taught this course is a disgrace to Dartmouth College. He lectured through material very quickly and did not explain a central topic clearly one time. Almost every class he would explain an important topic incorrectly and then say that he \"goofed up\". He would then fumble a proper explanation and move on at lightning pace. I disagree with one of the other comments about no one asking questions when Grant failed. How can you trust a professor to answer your question correctly when he cannot prepare a correct explanation before class? Furthermore, Grant should take a writing course at Dartmouth so that he can learn how to ask a clear question. Studying for a quiz means nothing when Grant asks you a question where you cannot understand what he is asking you to do. He then refuses to clarify what he means because it is his policy to not answer questions during quizzes. This is an atrocious copout from him, and truthfully, is because he is scared to admit how horrendous his quizzes are written. But at least he always answers his own questions correctly? Wrong. Grant consistently made mistakes on quiz solutions and barely took responsibility for his errors. He hid behind canvas announcements to correct his mistakes. He also refused to help you on the paper and presentation. Matthew Grant is a terrible professor, perhaps the worst I have ever encountered in my life, and this class is a joke with him at the helm. If you want to learn the material from this course, you would be better off reading a textbook. This class was a waste of time and money. Grant should be ashamed of himself. Next to professors like Snyder and Cascio, Grant is a joke. He lowers the standard of the economics department at Dartmouth College.\"",
            "review 8: \"23W with Matthew Grant: It's a shame that the Econ department consistently fails to find great professors for its classes and Econ 29 is no exception. Whereas 39 with Irwin was incredible, 29 with Grant was hard for no real reason and it's too bad both are in the same track. The other reviews have summed up a lot of the negatives, which are mostly fair. The main issue I noticed was that Grant just entirely skips over the more basic side of an explanation and assumes you know the first steps. It was really painful sitting in class while multiple people keep asking variations of the same question and Grant gives the same higher-level explanation when all he needed to do was start from the beginning. The worst example was introducing Current Account diagrams and Grant just skipped over explaining what the axes represented and when people kept asking about what the lines in the graph meant, he kept explaining in terms of the econ concepts when it was so obvious that all he needed to do was explain the axes and lines in simple terms. For those taking the class with Grant in the future, the textbook is a lifesaver. It explains the concepts in a way that makes actual intuitive sense and helps you actually decipher Grant's lectures. I felt that I actually learned a lot in the class and got a great understanding of the material, but that was almost entirely because I read everything in the textbook. The problem sets weren't too bad and just completion based anyway. The quizzes were the most annoying part since they were 10 multiple choice questions on Canvas with a 25 minute limit and you could only see and answer one question at a time and couldn't go back once you submitted an answer. As other reviews mentioned, he refuses to answer any questions during a quiz. This was another case where he should've just given us an explanation for why he structured it this way but he didn't and that seemed to feed into a lot of the negativity in other reviews. My best guess is that he does the quizzes this way so that it's really hard to share answers and cheat and since people get different questions at different times it's unfair to clarify a question to one person since not everyone will get the benefit. But he didn't tell us anything like that so his structure just seems cruel. Also the final was structured like a traditional econ final but it seemed every question was the type where you take a concept from class and put a twist on it to see if you really get the idea. Which is fine if you have one or two questions like that, but over half of them were this type. Overall, I'm still glad I took 29 with Grant over Zorzi (who focuses extensively on solving math equations and testing you on proofs, from what friends that took it with him said) since Grant teaches and tests exclusively on the concepts and doesn't require you to do any math. However, Grant really needs to work on how he explains things and get better at building the intuition for students that aren't already familiar with the concepts.\"",

I resorted to just reading the slides, which I don't usually do since it feels like cheating myself of actual learning. And Powerpoint is possibly the worst lecture tool when misused, which is the case with this class. Slideshows don't capture interest. They are an excuse to speed through the material and they rob students of efficient note-taking and actual pen-to-paper graph-drawing, unless those students can write quickly. And the biggest fault: the article readings. Pure insanity. Most of them were uninspiring and freakishly long and not suited for educational purposes. Prof. Edwards is very nice. But sometime after the first midterm, it seemed as if he gave up on us. He would cancel classes, rush through the lectures, return our assignments with zero comments, and not do corrections in class. Perhaps some students ticked him off. And was it just me who hated how he would have us rummaging for our graded assignments and exams with our scores written large on the front for all to see?

It was a 2A, which meant it was incredibly difficult to sit through-- a lot of people regularly skipped class or were just messing around on their computers. He also assigns readings with each chapter that were often only tangentially related and not very interesting-- either editorials from the Economist or longer case studies in econ journals that were annoying to read and have to memorize for the exams. This class (as well as a generally lack of interest on my part in the subject) made me drop my econ minor-- it was that tedious.

He was pretty lenient about giving partial credit, but some of the problems can be tricky if you let yourself get complacent (as I did). Fortunately, he also includes an extra credit assignment that's worth up to one letter grade if you complete it all (which only takes maybe 5-6 hours-- you basically do a write-up on each of the readings he assigned), so it's not hard to get a good grade (I didn't deserve an A but got one).

He doesn't teach everything in the textbook, but says you are responsible for all of it (although the way he tests that is by picking random definitions from bolded terms to test you on...which resulted in me memorizing terms rather than learning econ).

            "review 1: \"09F with Charles Wheelan: First off, let me start by saying that I had a great time taking this class. Prof. Wheelan is a very engaging and very good lecturer. He's approachable, funny, and clearly very learned and intelligent. I learned so much in this course, especially in very relevant public policy issues such as healthcare, education, and social security. I feel like I'm a much more informed person and I understand stuff I hear in the news and read in the paper a lot more having taken this class. I really liked writing the policy paper for this class because it gave us a chance to apply what we learn in class and write about a topic we're interested in. However, my one and only complaint would be that I did not love the grading. Part of it might be because I expected this to be a more quantitative class (since it's in the econ department) and instead Prof. Wheelan took a very qualitative approach. It was definitely much more of a public policy class than an econ class, and in fact Prof. Wheelan's PhD is in Public Policy (or public administration) and not in economics. Nevertheless, he's very knowledgeable in economics. But the approach of this class, in my opinion, placed too much emphasis on subjective analysis and memorization or random facts and details from the readings. And since a lot of the material (like healthcare) don't have cut and dry, correct or incorrect answers, I often felt that a lot of his grading on exams and quizzes were based on whether he liked your answers or not. His agree/disagree/uncertain questions on exams especially irked me, because there can be a variety of viewpoints that can all be defended, but Prof. Wheelan gave credit based on whether you agreed with his particular viewpoint. But that is my only complain about the class. All in all, a very good class, a great professor who's intelligent and witty, very interesting material. Definitely take it if you're interested in public policy or current events!\"",

Professor Wheelan is experienced, intelligent, and witty, but very open to discussion and respectful of his students. The course was organized around practical issues facing policy-makers in the U.S., and it covered most of the big ones: health care, the debt, tax policy, the environment, education and the power of special interests. It also addressed more theoretical concepts like public goods and externalities. The course was mostly qualitative, with only a few quantitative elements that anyone can easily pick up on the fly. The readings were useful and interesting, though they were unnecessarily heavy at times. I would recommend this class to pretty much everyone: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must for economics majors or anyone planning to go into policy, but it deals with issues that are relevant to us all. If you think policy or politics is boring, simple, or unrelated to your life, reserve judgment until you have taken ECON 28 with Wheelan. I loved it! The Professor Professor Wheelan has a great deal of personal and academic experience in public economics. He has a PhD in economics, so he knows his stuff when it comes to economic theory. However, he also recognizes and explores how the real world diverges from what classical economic theory would suggest. To do this, he draws on extensive experience. He is from Chicago and worked as the Midwestern correspondent for the Economist (which immediately gets him brownie points in my book). He also traveled the globe covering international issues for the Valley News. On top of that, he was the speechwriter for the governor of Maine and ran for Rahm Emmanuel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congress seat in Chicago. (He lost, but by less than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think.) He still travels extensively to give talks. Wheelan is a varied and interesting guy who leverages his adventures in public economics to spice up his classroom approach, but he does so while remaining considerate and open-minded. He is extremely responsive to students in class, asking a lot of questions and encouraging participation from everyone. In addition to being well versed in all the topics the course covers, he beings energy and enthusiasm to the classroom every day. Overall, a really capital fellow. The Course The class begins with an introduction to the theory of public economics, then moves into an issue by issue format. I found both to be very interesting, but especially our in-depth discussions of specific policy issues. Wheelan paints a balanced and nuanced picture of the debate over healthcare, tax policy, environment, climate change, welfare, the equity/efficiency tradeoff, education, special interests, and a host of other issues. He will occasionally allow his own views to color his portrayal of certain subjects, but for the most part he is impartial and respectful of each issue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complexity. Classes are fairly fast-paced but well organized, and the discussions are fantastic. These were some of the best classroom experiences I have had at Dartmouth. Furthermore, the policy paper is an excellent opportunity to explore a particular issue in detail. Unlike many professors, Wheelan encourages you to write to your audience as you would in real life\u00e2\u20ac\u201di.e., since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re most likely writing to policymakers, he wants you to be succinct and opinionated and to leverage your evidence as effectively as possible. He is available for feedback throughout the writing process, and he let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you turn in a rough draft as well as a final copy, with your final paper grade calculated as an average of the two. Grading The mid-term and final are each 25% of the points. These are lengthy, thorough written exams that easily let you express what you know about the topics that have been covered. I thought they were excellent assessments of the course material. The paper is worth 25%, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weekly\u00e2\u20ac\u009d quizzes over the readings provide the final 25%. These quizzes are my only real criticism of the course. Though he originally claimed that they would be given each week to ensure that we did the reading, I believe he only wound up giving four (along with two more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiz-like activities\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). While this might have been a relief for some, those of us who consistently did the reading would have liked more opportunity to boost our grades as a result. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a minor complaint, though. Overall, the course was graded thoroughly and fairly. The median this term was an A-, though he said it is typically lower.\"",

Everyone should take this course because it gives you a crash course on the important issues we'll have to face and vote on: social security, health care, the environment etc. It's not super-mathy unlike a lot of econ classes.

The class took a logical/qualitative look at many of the issues in Public Finance rather than a quantitive approach, so if you are expecting a lot of math you might be disappointed. Basically, we explore everything from Social Security and Medicare to Education and the Environment to the Median Voter Theorem and taxes. The readings, while not overly difficult, are nevertheless numerous and long, and backed up with weekly unannounced reading quizzes to make sure you're keeping up. I rather liked the descriptive and logical nature of the class over a math-based approach, because it allows you to understand the theory behind many of the topics without being bogged down in calculations. I think the only graph we had to know for the exam was tax incidence. The midterm and final relied on your ability to think through questions rationally, rather than spitting back facts from class. You needed to be able to apply the concept we discussed and justify your answers in order to do well. You also write a policy paper as an assignment, in which you get to choose a topic and formulate a recommendation. Since I am a public policy minor this was fairly simple, but if you have no experience in writing policy-type papers, you may need to spend a little more time, although Prof. Wheelan will give you the details in class. Overall, a very solid course, and I recommend taking it with Wheelan because he is very impressive (and also invited the class to dinner at his house!)\"",

The exams are somewhat arbitrary in that a lot of the question are agree, disagree and uncertain questions. Basically if you can write a lot and argue well you will get the points. Also, there is a paper required for the course which is kind of unusual for an econ class. It is very interesting but very un-econ if you've just taken econ 21 / 22.

There is a good mix of technical and less-technical elements (such as current affairs and real-life applications) in his daily review polls. However, I found his short assignments (there were 7 of them) heavier on the less-technical side, though they were still extremely analytically rigorous. For people worried about the peer grading system, it's honestly not that bad and unfair -- most people seemed to be accepting of it and it allowed for interesting feedback from peers. My only complaint about this is the lack of feedback from Luttmer himself -- we did not receive his feedback on our short assignments as only our grades for them were revealed at the end of the term. The class did have a decent workload, and effort is needed to score above the median for sure. However, no midterms and finals did help a lot. Generally a good class to take, would recommend taking it with Luttmer!\"",

The material was interesting and the structure of the class worked really well given the content. It's a great mix of quantitative and qualitative reasoning. While the student-centered grading structure was a little strange at first, it really started to make sense by the end.

            "review 4: \"23F with Erzo Luttmer: TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE THIS CLASS! I have so much to say about Econ 28- it is my favorite class that I have ever taken at Dartmouth. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely time intensive (more than any other econ class), but so worth it. We had no midterms or finals, just 7 writing assignments and 2 were in person (and counted for double). We had 2 in-person essays because he allows (and to some extent encourages) you to use chatgpt on your writing assignments. So in total, you have 9 assignment grades, but the lowest 2 get dropped. These assignments are worth 45% but only around a page each. Luttmer grades 2 or 3 of these assignments and for our year, the breakdown was 60% of the weight on the peer score and 40% of the weight on Luttmer's score to create the total 45%. Luttmer's grading was actually way nicer than my peer averages so this worked out for me... most years he says is 20% his grade and 80% peer scores. These assignments are all peer graded and the accuracy of your evaluations compared to other count for 15%. I can see why this is a controversial method but overall, I really didn't mind it. I feel like the all ended up evening out, and were often better than the grades I would have given to myself. 15% are contributions to discussion board (you have to write a paragraph engaging with the readings and then respond to another classmate before each class). This was graded for completion. Then 10% are review questions (via a poll) at the start of each class which are graded for correctness (the averages were really low for these, the median was a 6.2/10). Don't stress about these too much. 10% is class participation - talk at least twice a week!!!! He grades you on participation!!!!! Then a final 5% is quality of questions and answers during policy exercise. I actually got extra credit on this assignment and really didn't think I asked particularly insightful questions but he thought so. I am a PPE major so I was honestly scared to take an upper level econ class. I consider myself more gov minded and less math so the thought of having to take a final / midterm exam stressed me out. With this class I didn't have that. It was so evenly spaced out and you knew exactly what to expect week to week. I am also somewhat of a procrastinator so not having 2 exams worth 50% of your grade was huge. Instead your grade was developed week by week, day by day. This kind of meant you always had to be \"on\" but I enjoyed that more than the typical econ class. This class specially talked all about the economics of public policy and we learned a lot about insurance, Medicare / Medicaid, EITC, unemployment, etc which I found super interesting. I actually talked about what we were learning in this class during an interview that I had (and ended up receiving an offer letter for that job). This class is so applicable to the real world and by writing these short 1 page essays you understand how to apply these principles instead of just studying for the test then forgetting everything else. Next, Luttmer. He is truly the sweetest man alive and cares so so much about his students. He is from the Netherlands and you can tell by how anally fair he is. If you went to office hours and asked him a question, he would have you post that same question on a discussion board so everyone else can benefit from the answer. At the beginning of the course, it was more on the frustrating side, but by the end it was just endearing. He also has a talent for lecturing - he keeps all the students pretty engaged and when you zone out he ends up cold calling you or staring you down until you raise your hand. This could be intimidating but I liked it because I always had to pay attention as a result. He is such an amazing prof. Overall, the best course I've taken at Dartmouth and the class that I've gotten the most out of. Would take this class again and again if I could.\"",

I never felt like the assignments were busy work; even the discussion post felt like a good way to reflect on the readings (which were usually interesting, relevant, and from the popular press). I personally wasn't a big fan of the peer grading system (although I did get an A). The biggest reason I didn't like the peer grading system was that I felt like people didn't read all of the directions or the forum before they graded, so there would be comments that directly contradicted something in the answer key, forum, or directions. I also wish we received comment from Luther himself. Also, be prepared that the weekly writing vary greatly in the amount of time you need to write them because some weeks require research while others are just thinking about what you learned in class. I really like the daily review polls; they really incentivized reviewing material as you go rather than cramming before a test.\"",

First, Luttmer is an entertaining lecturer. How many econ professors have you had that are personable? His in-class polls keep me engaged and interested to see how smart I am compared to everyone else in the room (no penalty for getting the wrong answer). Second, the only real \"test\" in this class is 2 review questions at the start of each class. No notes allowed but the questions are pretty predictable. I would show up 5 min before class and go over what we did last class and then boom it's not too bad. Third, the 7 written assignment system is sick. You get to drop your two lowest scores, which for me meant I don't do two assignments at all. Very sick and the closest thing I've had to an econ layup. Would highly highly recommend this course with Luttmer.\"",

            "review 9: \"22S with Erzo Luttmer: Overall, this class was quite solid; however, there are some drawbacks which are important to consider. To start with the positives: Luttmer is very intelligent and an accomplished scholar. His classes are quite interactive and engaging, and the material is generally interesting and applicable to real life \u2014 for example, we learned how major national programs are funded, as well as the social and fiscal considerations necessary for policymaking. Another advantage of the class is the lack of problem sets, midterms, and final exams. Luttmer changed his instruction style last year during COVID, so in lieu of traditional assessments, we submitted weekly economic response papers. I found writing papers to be less stressful than taking exams, so if you're not a great test taker, this course is for you. Now to mention some drawbacks: The way in which writing assessments are graded is quite complicated. Half of essay grades are determined by how other peers anonymously rank your paper relative to other ones they receive. Because the papers required us to take a position on a specific policy, there was a political dimension. Luttmer encouraged students to assess other pieces on the validity of their economic reasoning, regardless of perspective, but it seemed many students lacked the ability to put biases aside in grading. In turn, I often took the path of least resistance and defaulted my submissions to the standard \"liberal\" argument. It's important to note that Luttmer, himself, encouraged open dialogue and diverse perspectives in the classroom; he even solicited feedback about the matter on the last day of classes, so I don't doubt his ability to be impartial. It just seemed that many students lacked that ability. While essays are preferable to tests, their weekly nature puts you in a constant work mode, so this class is pretty non-stop as well. Overall, the class is solid for ECON majors, and I particularly recommend it for people who don't enjoy test taking.\"",
            "review 10: \"22F with Erzo Luttmer: This class was very high quality in terms of Prof. Luttmer's teaching abilities and the engaging course topics, but it was also very stressful. The weekly writing assessments and 3x per week discussion posts meant that you were constantly working, and each week you had to speak at least once in class to get participation points (which he tracked quite seriously tbh). There were also mini quizzes (2-3 questions) at the beginning of every class that counted toward your grade, which doesn't seem like a lot until you get a few wrong and realize that it adds up. On the bright side, you could drop the lowest 2 writing assignments and also submit a form before class to have your quiz not count (up to 5 times) which took some pressure off. Prof. Luttmer emphasizes that it's more about the learning than the grade, which is a good sentiment but also hard to buy when he sticks to that B+ median so hard. I definitely learned a lot in this class and would 100% recommend if you're interested in the topics and enjoy writing! If you prefer the traditional midterm/final format, Prof. Mello might be better.\"",

We had six problem sets and eight paper discussions (thankfully graded on completion), a video project, two midterms, and a final. The only way to do well on the video project is to get multiple rounds of feedback from Professor Anderson by showing progress and asking for advice in her office hours regularly.

Prof Anderson was really good about uploading lectures which I really appreciated when studying for midterms, and put a lot of effort into making sure we understood psets and the material before exams. Didn't feel like the midterms/final were particularly difficult or easy which was nice for an econ class, and the class was not a huge time commitment.

The final is a little jarring because you get used to the time crunch and then you have a full three hours for a 1.5 hour final. It's helpful that the topic quizzes are easy, pset and reading discussions are completion. Professor Anderson would at unexpected times make very funny comments during class.\"",

Sometimes it was difficult to understand Professor Anderson in class and mask-wearing made it, at times, hard to hear her. However, she was always available to provide help and had office hours almost every day of the week. I found her one-on-one explanations to be extremely helpful in clarifying concepts and providing me thorough understanding of the material. The class lectures can be dry, but she also has a witty sense of dry humor, which I appreciated. She is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and I always enjoyed hearing her insight on labor topics in general. Overall, the workload is consistent and manageable, and success seems to be correlated with the work you put in. As long as you stay on top of the material, complete the practice problems that she provides from past exams, and go to office hours if you don't understand a concept, you should do well. I highly recommend taking this course if you're interested about the field.\"",

The beginning is pretty tough but it gets easier as the term goes on. It's important to take notes in class because the lecture slides do not have enough information on them to be able to teach yourself.

There is no math at all (literally, none) - just a lot of economic theory about the labor market. Prof Anderson could not have been a clearer or more organized lecturer - I thought that she was particularly good at explaining the material, and she was always open to answering whatever questions anyone had along the way. I particularly appreciated her dry sense of humor that she often threw into her lectures, although I frequently found that I was the only person laughing at her - even if you don't find her funny, you'll appreciate her effort, at least. She's very nice, friendly, and approachable, and she's willing to spend as much time with you as necessary in office hours if need be. The tests were challenging, but sometimes I felt that she asked questions that addressed topics that hadn't really been covered in lecture, or if they had, rather cursorily. I sometimes felt that if she had covered certain topics in more detail, I wouldn't have felt so confused on some questions. However, that might just have been my take on things. The problem sets were REALLY helpful in reinforcing the material, as well - even though she doesn't grade them, she does collect them to make sure that you do them, so it's worth putting the effort into it. It's a pretty solid course overall - you're probably not going to walk out of it thinking it's the best class you've ever taken, but you're definitely not going to have any complaints.\"",

If you like econ you'll find it interesting, if you don't you won't. You'll get as much out of this course as you put into it. It certainly doesn't take excessive effort to do well, just do the readings outside of class and make use of Professor Anderson's extensive use of blackboard - the slides she posts are especially helpful.

If you want to be prepared enough to feel confident about getting an A if called on, it is about 5 hours of work+reading minimum. The way this class is taught is truly genius. Kohn forces you to learn everything on your own and every class is simply a test. He deviates from the pset questions by rephrasing things to test if you understand your answer. As a result you will learn so much. After taking this class any finance article in the wall street journal or the economist will be a breeze to you and you will be able to form your own educated opinions about the financial system. There is something very satisfying about Kohn's no-nonsense approach. He values a concise and correct answer and nobody will be able to BS their way through a response. Don't let other intimidating reviews deter you.

I will disagree with the other reviewer who said they wished kohn had lectured more.

            "review 7: \"23W with Meir Kohn: What a class! At the start of the quarter, Kohn will tell you that this is an intensive class, and it is. You will regularly spend the whole evening before class MWF doing the chapter reading and the accompanying problem set/cold calling questions. It's essential to understand the fundamental concepts and how they are applied because sometimes he will start his cold calling by deviating from the p-set and ensuring you actually understand what say an interest-rate swap is. You do develop a rhythm and you will become less nervous if you're called, but there will come a point in the term where you need a break, and you just hope that he doesn't call on you (and sometimes it doesn't work out...). Despite the intensity, or perhaps because of it, you will learn a lot about finance and how our banking system has developed. As others have said, he does want you to succeed and his exams are not that difficult because he gives you 20 years of past papers and reuses most of the questions. So mastering the cold calling is the hard part, though it is true that there are some keywords to keep in mind: competition, (de-)regulation, diversification, and liquidity. One thing that would make the class better is if lectured a little more, especially on the difficult topics (chapter 16: derivatives). Depending on your other commitments, I will say that, unlike the other reviewers, I don't think you need to take it with only one other class: I took it during a 4-course term with another Econ class alongside it, so it is manageable.\"",

Professor Kohn insists on the Socratic method which I found pretty decent for learning things, but the way he picked on kids (he WILL laugh at and demean you in front of everyone if you get something wrong) bordered on sadism. You will probably learn and end up getting a decent grade all things considered but the sheer stress this course will put on you + the boringly methodic material makes it entirely not worth it. Exams are recycled from previous years'. You will need to put 16+ hours in a regular week, not to mention quizzes and the final. Would not recommend this class unless you want to do finance, and honestly even if you are interested in finance lol -- I know a few people who took this course and developed a hatred for the subject. Wouldn't recommend unless you handle stress well and enjoy agony.\"",

Your grade is 20% responses to cold-call questions which start in the assignment, and then Kohn discusses with you further (in front of the class). If you do do the assignment ahead of time, it is pretty easy to scrape out at least a B on your responses and if you get lucky, an A if you get an easier question. If you do this, you will be fine because the rest of your grade is based on a midterm and final which are easy because he provides plenty of practice exams that are very representative of the actual exam. I would recommend this class if you have the time as you learn a lot about financial topics that are pretty important/relevant, and it's not that hard to do well.\"",

The cold-calling can be a little harsh at first, when he tells you you're wrong in front of the whole class, but it gets easier each time. However, it does take FOREVER to prepare for each class. Hands-down the most work I've ever had to do for a class. It's around 5 hours of preparation before each class meeting (3x per week). Tests are easy because he gives you 10+ years worth of practice tests, which are pretty much identical to the test you end up taking. You also don't need to really understand the material to do well on the test - you just need to do enough practice tests to memorize the answers. Also loved Meir Kohn because he's a libertarian, which is hard to find in a liberal arts Econ department!

            "review 25: \"09F with Jonathan Zinman: I learned so much in this class, mostly because we covered a chapter a class from Meir Kohn's book on Financial markets and intermediaries. I finally understand what a security is, what a bank does, what Treasuries are, etc. The class was a TON of work, and the material is often quite overwhelming. Kohn's book is also pretty dry at times, and while some chapters explain concepts thoroughly, other chapters fall short of providing adequate explanations/examples showing you how to do some of the problems. Zinman is a hardass, and he said so himself in the first class. He has a randomizer that he uses to cold-call on students. If he happens to call on you to answer a question you don't know, you get a 0 for your participation grade for the day (and participation is 30% of your overall grade). The atmosphere of the class is pretty tense at times, because the other students are waiting to pounce on you at the first hint of a wrong answer, so that they can answer the question and get the participation points. I dreaded going to class at times because even if you prepared for 9/10 questions, as long as he calls on you for the one question you don't know you get a 0 for the day. I thought the randomizer was actually a disincentive to go to class because it's easier to ask him to excuse you than to show up to class with not knowing some of the answers and get called on (and get abruptly cut off by Zinman and given a 0 for the day). I also did not like the way the class was taught. I think the Socratic method works well for more qualitative classes, such as humanities classes, but if you don't understand an economic concept or a math problem then you just don't understand it, and no amount of Socratic questioning will change that. Zinman never answered any questions in class, he would just ask us our own questions back. There was also no point in going to office hours (not that he had any) because he told us point blank on the first class that he does not answer student questions during office hours. I have to say that during the term, I thought going to class was pretty useless (other than for the participation grade) because we were basically teaching ourselves the material from the book, which we could do without taking the class. But now that I look back, I realized that I would never have pushed myself to work so hard on understanding all the material, and finishing all the assignments on time if it hadn't been for the dreaded randomizer and Zinman. If he had been less of a hardass, I honestly probably wouldn't have worked as hard as I did, and probably wouldn't have learned as much. Zinman, while he didn't actually teach any of the material, forced us to learn it really well on our own. I guess this teaching method really isn't for everyone. In fact many people dropped the class after the first two weeks. If you are sensitive and you get upset at being cut off abruptly by a professor in front of your whole class, then you probably shouldn't take this class. I think the fact that Zinman ran the class so harshly is actually great preparation for those people who want to go into finance, because let's face it, working in finance is even more stressful and hardcore than econ 26. The material itself, if you keep up with the (very fast) pace of the class and all the long homework assignments, is not difficult and in fact very very interesting. It's just that the amount of the material and information you need to remember for the final is quite overwhelming. Nevertheless, I think this class was worth every dreaded moment and every minute spent reading Kohn's book in the library. Like me, you could go from knowing nothing at all about finance to having a very solid understanding of the topic in 10 weeks. All in all, I am very glad that I took this class, and that I took it with Prof. Zinman, because even though he didn't actually teach us anything (he doesn't lecture, per the Socratic method), he nevertheless pushed us to learn on our own and forced us to always come up with thoughtful and intelligent answers for class.\"",
            "review 26: \"08X with Meir Kohn: This class more or less lives up to its expectations. Be prepared to devote a large portion of your sophomore summer (or whatever term you're taking it in) to Kohn's textbook. To be honest, the scariest part of the class is facing Kohn's probing questions during each period. The threat of being called on is enough to make you do the work before each class- easily occupying 3+ hours per class period. On top of textbook reading, you usually have from 2-8 other articles to read and a worksheet with questions to answer. Don't underestimate the amount of time these will take. There is also some math, especially further into the term, so practice those problems because they really screwed me up on the first midterm. Otherwise, the tests are not that bad in comparison to the possibility of being humiliated in class or having Prof. Kohn crack a joke at your expense. With that being said, Kohn does have a certain knack for dry humor that you will appreciate because it breaks up the tension in the room every once in a while. Still, this class was a bad memory for me from my sophomore summer.\"",

This class was organized differently than anything else I've ever taken - before every class you're required to read a chapter from the textbook (which Professor Kohn wrote,) then complete a very lengthy problem set. During class Professor Kohn goes through the problem set, calling on students to answer questions. A very large part of the final grade is based on this in-class participation, and a very comprehensive completion of the problem set is necessary. Having a good group of people to work with is an absolute necessity to do well in the class, as is being able to commit 4-6 hours before every class for reading and problem sets. It was a ton of work, but I came out with an understanding of the course material beyond anything I've ever experienced before after one term of work. Professor Kohn is very set in his fairly conservative economic theory, but he can also always provide a flawless argument for why he is correct. If I knew another class would be this much work, but I would know the material this well afterward, I would absolutely do it.\"",

If you don't know anyone else taking the class, befriend someone - this is the one class you really need a study group for to go over the problem sets. The material is interesting, but all the work will burn you out by the end of the term. Kohn's attitude of \"I want you to figure it out for yourself\" bothered me as well - on the first day he tells you that he won't explain the material during his office hours, which seems a lot to pay $3000+ for someone who makes it very clear he does not want to be used as a resource outside of class.\"",

It is a very self-selecting class, and so the median is typically a high B or low A, but there is an incredible amount of work to do. however, this was one of the most valuable and worth-it classes i have ever taken, anywhere. Kohn and his textbook are incredibly lucid and explain huge topics in incremental and understandable terms. most importantly, kohn teaches you to ask the questions rather than to study the answers, which is by far the most important aspect of his course. he brings an incredible amount of real-world examples into class, and by the end of the term you will be able to look at any financial article and pick it apart, judge it's accuracy and b.s. factor, and understand it. pick a term that you can handle and truly devote yourself to this course, but take it! if you want to look back and truly be amazed by how much real-world, useful, interesting knowledge you have gained (not only for econ majors!) take this course, and take it with kohn.\"",

I read the entire textbook and I feel I learned a LOT, enough to want to be a major. The sort of tension (terror) in the room about being called on/grilled is something I came to love and will surely miss in other Econ classes. This class is hard, but take it with Kohn.

He honestly isn't that intimidating, but rather the way he asks questions keeps you on your toes.

And he definitely admits when he's wrong (like the thousands of typos in the textbook). It can be intimidating at first, but I really liked the format of the class. You have to do your work for every class because you might get called on at any time-- but that was great for me, because it forced me to do all the readings on time. If you have trouble speaking in public, this class will be tougher than most, but Kohn understands that some people have trouble, and he generally is nice to people who are making an effort but are having trouble explaining themselves. That said, he can be pretty harsh if you obviously haven't done the reading or aren't making an effort to understand the material. With the amount of time you have to spend to get the reading done, and then do the problem sets, you put a lot of work in throughout the term, and the midterm (only one) and final are not that hard. Just go over the practice tests a ton, and you'll be fine. He even let us bring in a cheat sheet with anything we wanted to both exams. And because the material is so interesting, this class is really rewarding. It will easily be the most useful class I'll take at Dartmouth. You learn about how the current financial systems have evolved, so you actually understand what is going on in finance AND why. Stocks, bonds, life insurance, retirement savings, mortgages, corporate funding--this is stuff that will affect everyone at some point, and understanding how it all works now will give you a headstart on the real world.

            "review 42: \"06X with Meir Kohn: The socratic method here and the reading overload (about 30-txtbkpages a night accompanied by 3hour problem set) are well-known and an anticipated, next step into the I've-recently-declared-my-econ-major/with-an-inclination-towards-i-banking phase. there is nothing wrong with hard work and being \"put on the spot\" when the prof. randomly calls out the students for problem set questions. What is not healthy is the gloom and fear that presides over the Kohn classroom. Yeah, if you're fully prepared for class and have already developed a space for your ego, then you will not be sweating out the time Kohn will inevitably call on you. Yet I imagine most normal D-mouth students don't have the time to prepare to the extent he expects... he appreciates nothing short of excellence, and in that way Kohn is a genius Prof. simply unsuitable for Intro-to-Financial-Markets, though he wrote the book on it. The ass-kissers are never safe from his sharp tongue, b/c they inevitably simple out some B.S. when they run out of reasonable things to say, which Kohn has no patience for - in this way, Kohn is again a good/fair man, but asks too much of us. Luck doesn't really play too much a role in your assessed performance in class. There are harder questions than easier ones,yes, but Kohn delves so deeply into each question that its really apparent whether you know your stuff or not. The only really SAFE questions are the quantitative ones... in another aspect, there some luck involved, and that has to do with when you are called, not within each problem set, but within the general timeline/structure of the class. For the first few weeks, most will be able to suck it up, have no life, and prepare meticulously for each class. The real bugger is that halfway through the term(generally after the midterm), material is sift through rapidly, shifting from market-to-market, and many poor, unfortunate souls will not be recognized for the level of preparation that they give to most chapters (not be called on when they are prepared), and suffer dearly for the times they are not prepared. Each class/chapter when you are not called on is discouraging b/c you are not rewarded for the sacrifices you put in to be prepared. Wait, you might say, aren't we here for the education - the knowledge is reward enough! No, b/c I'm talking about the unrecognized extra 3 hours you put in to be prepared when you are grilled by Kohn, as opposed to the \"lite\" preparation you could have put in, and filled the holes in your knowledge with the goings-on in class (other people getting grilled). That's another point - the benefits of the socratic method to learning are dubious: you learn just as much in class, when others are grilled... the only thing this format does for you is teach you to think on your feet...and is that really so important a skill to foster now, that your grade largely depends on it? The cost of this \"skill\" is a general discouragement for smart kids who learn differently - I strongly believe I speak for most of the class. To finish off the term-structure/luck thing, the end of the term is probably the easiest/best time to get called on - you pick up the general maxims that Kohn looks for behind every problem set question, and the last few chapters are a general overview of the textbook - by now, you are more than ever with some composure and hopefully on top of your sh*t. One thing you should know, you will pay a price for absence - its seems logical that you can avoid your lack of preparation for a particular chapter, because if everyone has to be called on over the term an equal number of times, then those in class will answer more frequently in the beginning of the term, and those absent, will answer more frequently later in the term - it should even out. however, it unfortunately plays out such that people are absent at different times, and your grade will suffer for absence. worse: if you sit in the front, he will notice your absence and likely penalize you for every absence with a zero or C (as part of the 8 times you are expected to be called on throughout the term) - he might not even say your name aloud in class, so its best to be in communication with him - being the fair man that he is, he will show you your class grades and be willing to discuss your problems in class - though again, the man simply asking for your everything and if you're not willing to give that, he can't do much to help you out.\"",

Kohn has a bit of a power trip going in class - he asks the questions, he wrote the book, he's in control, etc. But if there's one way to make sure you really learn the stuff, it's by taking finance with Kohn. The view of the finance system he presents is very comprehensive, including the history of the banking industry in the US, England, Germany, and Japan; other intermediaries - like insurance, mutual funds, finance companies, and thrifts; market making in debt, equity, and futures; and recent issues in finance especially ones dealing with the regulation and deregualtion of markets/banking. It's a lot of work, but it becomes routine by about the third week. If there's one gripe I have with the class it's that not enough of the grade was based on class participation, as I found the multiple choice section on both the midterm and final to be mostly insignificant minutia that was not nearly as important (to me, at least) as the hours of in-class conversation.\"",

You can't coast on a semi-understanding of the material, you have to really grasp it... and that's the beauty of it. Prof. Kohn forces you to really go in depth and answer stuff on your own, and in the end you feel you've really learnt something. SO IS THIS A COURSE FOR YOU? This course is not for everyone.

It ruined, that's right I said ruined, my entire sophomore summer to take this course. I knew that he was difficult when I entered, but I could never have imagined how unfriendly and unhelpful this professor turned out to be. It's one thing to have difficult course material, of which Econ 26 is entirely composed. It is quite another to have a professor who refuses to assist you in the pursuit of knowledge. He wrote the textbook, a convoluted conglomeration of history and economics with formulas and theory randomly tossed in. He never lectured. Oops, no he lectured the first day and prefaced that lecture with this quote: \"You can have a good grade in this class, or a good summer You cannot have both.\" I ended up not having either. So he wrote this book a few years ago I guess. I doubt he has read it since because there would be times I would ask a question about the reading only to hear the response: \"Oh, I'm not sure about the answer to that.\" Then he would move on. He moved on. One would expect an author to remember the contents of his own book. But no, the material is so inconsequential that he doesn't bother to revisit or remember it. But on the bright side, there are times he has 'vague recollections'. We read his gigantic chapters for every \"class\" and then he brutally randomly calls on unsuspecting students to answer his questions. If you didn't know the entire answer, beware. The best part, oh this is good, is when students would go to his office hours to ask a question about a specific part of the homework, let's say swaps. He would respond: \"Bring up your question in class when we get to that part of the homework.\" Then we would get to class and he would ask that same student all the questions pertaining to the material he or she did not understand, in this example, all about swaps. And to liven things up a little he would sometimes make up questions that weren't in the homework and you were still expected to answer them fully. His exams were not reflective of the material. He would pass out sample exams and then deliberately create an entirely different type of exam. His final is 50% of the grade which is ridiculous once you consider how difficult and gigantic the material is throughout the term. And you cannot have personal problems or sick days. These are the reasons why I would suggest taking this class: 1. You are a glutton for punishment. 2. You don't care about your GPA because it will definitely be shot to hell. 3. You already have no life besides economics because you certainly won't after this class. 4. You never get frustrated. 5. Having your dignity shredded isn't problematic for you. If this review has sounded bitter or angry then I would say it is reflective of how I feel six months after taking his class. I am bitter that I killed myself for him and that I got no assistance or enjoyment out of his class. The entire 6 sequence sucks. Take any other sequence. Even environmental economics would be better.\"",
            "review 70: \"02X with Meir Kohn: Ok, seeing that I haven't read any of the other reviews my fellow classmates have provided, I can't react to their comments. What I will say is this: Even after taking a lot of chem classes, this class was A LOT of work. Which, in and of itself, if you know this going into the class isn't bad. The problem is that your grade may not reflect the endless hours you put into the course. The exams aren't difficult per se - no tricky questions. The problem with Kohn's exams is that, more or less, he expects you to retain every damn detail in his 1000 page book. That's right, you use his, unpublished text for the class. So, at best, his exams are random because he provides no indication what material is more test worthy than the rest of it. As for the classes themselves, he gives one lecture in the term - on the first day of classes. Subsequent to that, you have roughly a chapter per class (anywhere between 25 and 50 pages) in the text plus a handful of questions - some from the text, others based on reserve readings (clippings from the financial press). He then randonly calls off his roll for someone to answer each question. He asks questions related to the question at hand to see if you really understand what's going on. His lectures really pertain to clarifying, elucidating concepts that the students don't seem to be grasping. I do recommend, that if you have questions, take him up on his offer at the beginning of each class and ask him them - it means less time him calling on the class and chances are, other people have the same question as you. I don't think he's the horrific prof other people have made him out to be, but this class is no cakewalk. And for those looking for a b.s. sophomore summer class, this is most certainly not it. However, if you take the class and really prepare for it, even if you don't reap the rewards in terms of the grade, you will have learned A LOT.\"",

            "review 6: \"22F with Jonathan Zinman: OVERALL: I enjoyed this class. I learned a lot about finance (Zinman\u2019s statement that \u201cfinance is everywhere\u201d really turns out to be true once you finish the course and start seeing world events, markets, etc. from this perspective) and honestly this course tilted me more towards a career in finance or at least business/economics. But, grading can be somewhat vague \u2013 this is definitely something to consider alongside interest and major requirements. PROF: Zinman is a great professor. He is clearly knowledgable, and has lots of experience in finance. Ask him about his litigation consulting, personal finance, microfinance, etc. work \u2013 he is happy to talk about his past and he can give you lots of insight which is helpful for the term project as well as getting to learn more about finance. But, what many people say is true: he can be a hardass. He follows the rules, and is quite rigorous (see: his Google Docs syllabi and nested sub-syllabi). Overall, he may take some getting used to, but he is knowledgable and good at teaching this course. COURSE STYLE: Zinman uses the group work model, as well as cold-calling. While both may be daunting or feel unnecessary at first, they do work for learning \u2013 they just may not be the best for your grade. Groups are essential to the course as you work with them for every assignment, and the big final project. This can be great: if you\u2019re a hard worker and so is your group, you will have a great time. If you are with a bad group (slackers, people that don\u2019t communicate, etc.) you will have trouble and this can really drag down your experience. Cold-calling may sound daunting at first but really is not that big of a deal. Zinman has a list and will cold call, but you usually will have the answer (if you do the work), and even if you don\u2019t have the right answer if you make a good attempt he won\u2019t harshly put that against you. Most importantly, if you volunteer and speak up during class, you are less likely to be forcefully cold-called. GRADING: The main graded components are: participation, assignment questions, quizzes, and the term project. There are a couple other things like assignment summaries but those are not things you really need to worry about. Just speak up in class for participation. Assignment questions can be iffy, sometimes it felt like trying to outsmart him or his grading could be vague. The quizzes were total crapshoots, the multiple choice options often were very vague and getting the right answer relied on luck or recognizing some really small detail in the answers and picking correctly. The term project is the biggest thing, really invest time early into picking a good topic and you can set yourself up well. ASSIGNMENTS: This is where I think the course shines. With your group, before every synchronous class (you only meet synchronously twice a week, we had M and F, and Wednesdays were for term project meetings with your group), he lays out questions/objectives we should research and learn about in preparation for class. He gives you 3 textbooks and open internet. This was very fun for me but could be stressful for others \u2013 basically, you have to learn on your own, he doesn\u2019t just teach it to you. This teaches you how to learn independently, and how to properly research topics. I think this is incredibly important and honestly I enjoyed reading from Investopedia a lot. In class, Zinman will go over these assignments, and generally highlight some of the key points he wants us to take away from the assignment. At first, I thought this system was really stupid, but I realized that finance can be learned in many ways \u2013 individual economists (or textbook authors) may see things differently, and Zinman will criticize these authors (Kohn, Bodie, etc.) at various points in the course. Overall, I learned a lot from these assignments and enjoyed how we weren\u2019t being graded directly on this research process.\"",

I have some experience in finance, which really helped, but here's my overall breakdown of the course: The course is entirely group based, so you're set in a group and you get that group for the entire term. You do assignments for every class with them, and a final project worth around 45% of your grade. If you get a bad group you're kinda outta luck, because this group is majority group work. How it works is, for every class, you get an assignment (not due for a grade or completion) every class and you get cold-called and graded on participation in a discussion about that assignment in class. There are weekly quizzes with around a 9/12 median. Do not take this class if you are afraid of speaking up and volunteering answers and insights you have in the material. Can be kinda scary sometimes because Zinman is no BS, but overall a super super interesting class that I highly recommend to anyone interested in how the economy is propped up by financial intermediaries. Workload is around 10ish hours a week on assignments (just to prepare for the discussion) with your group and reading (did I mention you have to find material in the 3 textbooks, he doesn't tell you where to look), a few hours a week for the final project that gets greater as you go along in the course (starts at 0 and finished at like 20).

At first, I was hesitant on the new course format given its extremely heavy emphasis on group work, but I ended up enjoying the collaborative aspect of solving problems as a team. Zinman can appear tough in class but recognizes participation efforts; I had no finance background and often did not give precisely correct answers to questions, but still ended up doing well in the course. While there is cold-calling in class, Zinman never used it to try and throw off students or expose knowledge deficiencies. I also really enjoyed the group project and thought the feedback process was well-designed. There were no exams in 21S, but the weekly quizzes were very tough, and class quiz averages were quite low; these were ultimately curved, however, based on the final median.

There's a final project where you apply an econ26 concept to a real world problem and weekly quizzes that were manageable albeit ambiguously worded at times. TAs aren't super helpful.

            "review 15: \"17F with Jonathan Zinman: COURSE: The cold calling format was motivating and made the class more enjoyable than almost any I\u2019ve taken at Dartmouth. The professor would have us read a chapter in the textbook and a few articles and answer questions on the reading before each lecture. In each lecture, instead of lecturing, he would randomly call on students to answer the questions. If a student struggled to respond satisfactorily, other students could respond to the question. Students were graded on their performance. At first, I did fairly well answering the questions in the lecture, and the satisfaction from my initial good performance motivated me to read the textbook & articles and answer questions even more carefully for the next lecture so I could be rewarded by performing even better during the next lecture. This work-reward cycle caused my performance and motivation to improve with every lecture, so by the end of the term I was almost passionate and very effective at answering questions on the spot - the course didn\u2019t just improve my understanding of the financial sector, it improved my speaking, reading comprehension, and analytical abilities to the extent that I felt smarter by the end of the term. PROFESSOR: I\u2019ve sat in lectures for Kohn when I was shopping the class over the summer and I think both Zinman and him are of comparable ability. They both do a good job facilitating the cold calling teaching style and explaining concepts when students can\u2019t satisfactorily answer questions. I think there homeworks are very similar, although there exams are a bit different.\"",

Prof. Zinman does a great job of covering the topics in the textbook and relating them to real world phenomena - we were reading actual WSJ articles and discussing them in class. The Socrates method wasn't as intimidating as I thought, sometimes if Prof. Zinman calls on you and you just say I don't know how to do this one, he will just move on to another student (but rest assured that he will call on you again the next day). The midterm and final were interesting and require actual understanding of the concepts mentioned instead of just memorization of the concept. There were also a lot of open-ended questions expanding on the topics we learned in class, which I found really interesting.\"",
            "review 17: \"09F with Jonathan Zinman: I learned so much in this class, mostly because we covered a chapter a class from Meir Kohn's book on Financial markets and intermediaries. I finally understand what a security is, what a bank does, what Treasuries are, etc. The class was a TON of work, and the material is often quite overwhelming. Kohn's book is also pretty dry at times, and while some chapters explain concepts thoroughly, other chapters fall short of providing adequate explanations/examples showing you how to do some of the problems. Zinman is a hardass, and he said so himself in the first class. He has a randomizer that he uses to cold-call on students. If he happens to call on you to answer a question you don't know, you get a 0 for your participation grade for the day (and participation is 30% of your overall grade). The atmosphere of the class is pretty tense at times, because the other students are waiting to pounce on you at the first hint of a wrong answer, so that they can answer the question and get the participation points. I dreaded going to class at times because even if you prepared for 9/10 questions, as long as he calls on you for the one question you don't know you get a 0 for the day. I thought the randomizer was actually a disincentive to go to class because it's easier to ask him to excuse you than to show up to class with not knowing some of the answers and get called on (and get abruptly cut off by Zinman and given a 0 for the day). I also did not like the way the class was taught. I think the Socratic method works well for more qualitative classes, such as humanities classes, but if you don't understand an economic concept or a math problem then you just don't understand it, and no amount of Socratic questioning will change that. Zinman never answered any questions in class, he would just ask us our own questions back. There was also no point in going to office hours (not that he had any) because he told us point blank on the first class that he does not answer student questions during office hours. I have to say that during the term, I thought going to class was pretty useless (other than for the participation grade) because we were basically teaching ourselves the material from the book, which we could do without taking the class. But now that I look back, I realized that I would never have pushed myself to work so hard on understanding all the material, and finishing all the assignments on time if it hadn't been for the dreaded randomizer and Zinman. If he had been less of a hardass, I honestly probably wouldn't have worked as hard as I did, and probably wouldn't have learned as much. Zinman, while he didn't actually teach any of the material, forced us to learn it really well on our own. I guess this teaching method really isn't for everyone. In fact many people dropped the class after the first two weeks. If you are sensitive and you get upset at being cut off abruptly by a professor in front of your whole class, then you probably shouldn't take this class. I think the fact that Zinman ran the class so harshly is actually great preparation for those people who want to go into finance, because let's face it, working in finance is even more stressful and hardcore than econ 26. The material itself, if you keep up with the (very fast) pace of the class and all the long homework assignments, is not difficult and in fact very very interesting. It's just that the amount of the material and information you need to remember for the final is quite overwhelming. Nevertheless, I think this class was worth every dreaded moment and every minute spent reading Kohn's book in the library. Like me, you could go from knowing nothing at all about finance to having a very solid understanding of the topic in 10 weeks. All in all, I am very glad that I took this class, and that I took it with Prof. Zinman, because even though he didn't actually teach us anything (he doesn't lecture, per the Socratic method), he nevertheless pushed us to learn on our own and forced us to always come up with thoughtful and intelligent answers for class.\"",

            "review 19: \"09F with Jonathan Zinman: So apparently Doyle was kicked out of the Kohn and Zinman's Econ 26 Old Boys' Club, which means no matter who you have, you'll be getting cold-called and Socratic-method'd. I didn't have Kohn, but I can speak of the horrors of Zinman's class. Before I get to the juicy, awful parts, let me state the positives. If you want to go into finance, this class is amazing. Well, the content is anyway. You WILL learn all the fundamentals about I-banking, markets, and intermediaries, and you will probably feel accomplished upon doing so. Great, huh? Anyway, the format is simple. You read a texbook chapter and 4-5 articles and answer in-depth, high-level discussion questions about both, before every class. In class, Zinman uses a computer program to randomly call on people, who must then answer one (or several) of the questions. If your answer isn't good enough he'll grill you harder, or even worse, he'll cut you off abruptly and call on a volunteer. When the question is adequately answered he'll scribble down a grade (from 1 to 5) for each person who spoke. Zinman does not lecture, nor does he answer questions with anything more than other questions, intended for students to answer. Sound fun? Oh, and Zinman refuses to answer individual blitzes, and his offputting demeanor makes the thought of going to office hours laughable. He even proclaimed himself as a \"hardass\" in one class, with his fondness for the socratic method as his only defense. I'm sure this class is a joy for those who are ahead-of-the-curve and can consistently come up with insightful answers, but if you're average to below-average, every class is a terror-inducing nightmare, where you will pray that you're not called on, while simulatenously hoping that you are (because 30% of your grade is based on the quality and quantity of your answers in class). The fundamental conclusion that I've come to is that the same volume of useful and interesting material could be taught in any number of less intimidating and unpleasant ways. But that's too bad, because you don't have a choice. As far exams go, study the past exams provided on blackboard- those are really all you need. The multiple choice (and short answers, even) all seem to be drawn from a pool, so if you have looked at the past exams, there will only be a question or two on your exam that you've never seen. In that sense the exams aren't too bad. In short, expect to spend 2-3 hours preparing for each class only to have your pitiful answers publicly refuted by Zinman (or even another student). Exams aren't bad but do not attempt to take this with any other high-stress high-workload class in the same term.\"",

            "review 36: \"06S with Jonathan Zinman: This class was the most difficult/time consuming class I've taken at dartmouth thus far. However I learned more in this class than I have in any other class. I found the topic interesting and useful. It's basically how the entire banking/finance system works and how it developed to where it is today. If you don't need to take this class or this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then I would say stay away from this class. The class uses the socratic method, basically discussion based with the prof randomly asking students questions from the reading/problem set. There is no \"lecturing\" during the class at all. Class participation is worth 20 percent of the grade, and he uses a computer randomizer with the class list to select people. If you get called on when you're not there then you get a zero for that participation. I hear that zinman is much nicer than Kohn, who basically created the class and would humiliate students who didn't come prepaired. Still, the threat of being called on and embarassed in front of the class is the strongest motivation to do my homework that I have experienced. Homework for this class is time consuming! Before EVERY class you must read a chapter in the textbook and usually some extra articles, and then answer a problem set. This usually takes at least 4 hours for every class. So I spent at least 12 hours a week, probably more, for this class. During class Zinman doesn't answer many questions, instead he passes them on to other students who can answer them and get participation grades. The exams are somewhat unfair. We spend the entire term doing these problem sets which are usually open ended questions that sometimes don't even have a definite correct answer, so that they spur more discussion in class. The format of the exam is mostly multiple choice, with some free response which are entirely computational. Fortunately Zinman posted a bunch of old midterms and finals on blackboard, so that we could get some practice with the format of the exam, which was very very helpful. So if you want to do well in this class, do all the homework, speak up in class, and do every single one of the practice exams at least once and study alot to get ready for the midterm and final.

However, Simons takes a completely different approach to the course. Instead of teaching via the Socratic method, she handles the course like any other Econ class -- regular lecture style with PowerPoint, etc. Her lectures themselves are nothing amazing, but they're very clear and she adds a lot about her own experiences while working at the Fed and in the \"real world\" stuff she has done with the material you learn in Econ 26. She is very laid back in her approach, which unfortunately means that it's pretty easy to space out during lectures. She is very nice, helpful during office hours, and extremely available over e-mail -- I'd usually get a response from her within a few hours, even over the weekend. And she even has a screen name that we could use to ask her for help during her office hours and the nights before exams. On the syllabus, she lists the chapters to read before each class and recommended problems to do from the back of the chapter, but she ended up getting so far behind on the schedule that I got lazy and stopped doing it -- it didn't really matter overall though, as basically everything you needed to know was covered in lecture. A few times, she got really sidetracked on a variety of tangents that were only very peripherally related to the course material, and then she ended up going ridiculously fast through some sections trying to catch up. And every now and then, she'd stick random pictures of her cats on the slides -- like one Photoshopped image of her cat sitting on top of a Japanese pagoda (yes, I know it sounds weird, but it's true). There were three problem sets throughout the term, but they were entirely optional and were only there if you wanted additional practice -- but they're good preparation for the exams, so I recommend that you do them. The one slightly irritating thing about the course were weekly quizzes that she would post on Blackboard that we had to do by 5 pm on Friday, but they usually took a half hour at most and you could get answers to most of the questions verbatim from the textbook -- so they were really more just annoying than anything else, because you had to remember to do it each week (although in fairness, she always reminded us in class). The first midterm was somewhat difficult, the second midterm was surprisingly easy, and the final was a beast -- so just be aware of that in advance. However, overall, if you want a low-stress way to take Econ 26, this is the way to do it.

The problem was that about half the time, the slides would not be posted before class, or if they were, they would be on blackboard about five minutes prior to the class's commencement. There was no way to follow her lectures without the slides and a few people definitely took the time to nap. It was also amazing to see how many people were actually in the class, since so many never showed up to lecture. The text was dry, but informative. Exams were difficult, especially the final. There are weekly grade boosting quizzes on blackboard that are open note, open book. You can bring a 1 page front and back cheat sheet for each midterm and 2 pages front and back for the final. Problem sets are not graded but are helpful to study for exams. Simons is not particularly helpful in office hours. Doesn't seem like a class that's too difficult or one that requires a lot of work, until you get to exams. On average I spent 10 hours per week on this class. That meant I spent about 2 hours a week reading for class, maybe another 2 on the quizzes, and then the rest on making a sheet for the exam (quite time consuming).

She talks about ridiculously famous people she studied under or with at MIT as if they were your next door neighbor. She also worked at the FED and talks about that in much the same way. I have come out of the course believing, maybe naively, that people like Greenspan and Bernanke are just like me and you. She cares about you. Couple days before midterm and final exams, she will run office hour marathons, trying to get everyone up to par. I've never seen another professor offer as many office hours as Doyle. During the office hours she doesn't make you feel dumb. However, she does sometimes confuse you. But she keeps going on and on, so you don't want to tell her that you understood nothing she's been telling you for the last 10 minutes. But on the whole, office hours are worth it and so that's all great and good. She's nice and will listen to what you have to say, so personality-wise the professor is awesome. Now unto the grading. There is a group project worth 15% of your grade. A short, honestly, 3 minute presentation with a buddy. At the end you write a two to three page, double spaced write-up. Just anything going in the economy currently which expands on anything learned in class. The whole thing takes like 3 hours work max. It's great. Midterm is 25% and Final is 35%. They are a fair assessment. They test you on diverse things. Details, concepts, math league type twisters. They are a fair assessment of what you have learned. If you have been keeping up with your work, you can rest assure. However, keeping up with your work doesn't mean you will get an A. You need to think deeply about the subject matter too. It is not all memorization. Quizzes are 20% of your grade. There are four quizzes. She drops the lowest grade. Thank God, cause I got like a 60% on one of them. Anyways, they are detail-oriented. So, I think basically, if you did well on the quizzes, you generally liked the course. If you didn't, the course really annoyed you. I generally did okay, thanks to the dropping, but you need to read the text and look over your notes. This is crucial for the quizzes. They are not a walk in the park. Then 5% is participation. Just go to class 90% of the time and you'll probably get this. She takes attendance every class, which was kind of weird, but it's what it is. On the whole, I recommend this class.

In addition, Welborn focused more on the more relevant concepts by not fretting over the correctness of the math but rather making sure that we're heading in the right direction with the concepts.

It's hard work, but if you're up for the challenge, you'll learn the material more thoroughly than you would through a general survey course. The economic journal articles illustrate how economists arrive at these models we read about in textbooks. You'll see some theoretical development, empirical testing, and dissenting opinions. This allows you to think critically about how economics fits into the real world, instead of simply accepting whatever assumptions your textbook hands you and then mechanically working your way through a problem. And the legal readings demonstrate how the theory coexists with the law. You'll see how the theory has influenced the development of the law in a sensible way, but you'll also see how the courts sometimes check and dismiss theoretical output as too abstract, simple, or inadequately supported. It's satisfying to see economics influencing policy but also reassuring to see that the heroic assumptions and conclusions economists sometimes make are held to a rigorous standard.

The readings are often long, boring, and painful, and Prof. Scott has the maddening tendency to ask ridiculously detailed \"very short answer\" multiple choice questions on every exam that make it painfully clear whether or not you actually *did* the readings. Shoot, even having done most of them, I still only got 5/8 of them right on the 2 midterms. Prof. Scott is a really great guy, and a generally decent professor, who knows his material like the back of his hand. He can, however, be *exceedingly* (and sometimes painfully) verbose, going into *excrutiating* detail where it isn't at all necessary. The best example I can cite was one of his papers he had us read; he went on for 40-some pages when the first sentence of his abstract summarized the entire opus perfectly. Overall, I enjoyed the course, but would certainly caution people who are just looking for a simple class; it's interesting, and can be relatively easy *if you make it that way,* but I would say this class is best-suited to those who actually enjoy the subject matter.\"",

Be sure to read the articles, because Prof. Scott puts a few multiple choice questions about them on the midterms and finals as a type of \"reading check.\" Be sure to understand all the graphs and explanations on the Powerpoint slides (which he sends out) as he tests heavily from them.

The textbook doesn't give you much information that you can't learn by going to class, but Scott jumps around in the book in assigning readings to such an extent that it can get pretty confusing to tie ideas in the textbook to what's going on in class.

Second, the book is much of the times a lot clearer than Scott's lectures and it was through the book that I learned most of the course material.

The class is a little bit disorganized. The first half of the course is pretty stress-free, but the second half consisted of 2 pitch presentations (rough draft and final), a collusion game that you play with your class where you act as a price setter for your assigned gas station (you have to write a 4-5 page paper on your game strategies), and a final exam worth ~30% of your grade. The professor didn't spend much time talking about how to do our pitch projects and play the collusion game during regular lectures so you'd be pretty lost if you don't go to office hours.

Unfortunately, the class was a simply a beefed up version of Econ 21. To start with the positives: Welborn is extremely knowledgeable and has a great presence. His digressions during lectures to talk about real-world business issues were always insightful. He is also very personable. My disappointment with the course isn't with Welborn himself, but rather the way in which he teaches the class. Most importantly, Welborn uses a flipped classroom model. Before every class, you have to teach yourself a chapter from a textbook, and during class, you review assigned textbook problems. I found the textbook to be quite confusing at times, and would have appreciated in-person lectures. Further, the material is very technical, math-heavy and includes a lot of calculus proofs \u2014 which the textbook does a poor job at explaining. The grade is almost entirely determined by tests: Each midterm is worth 20%, and the final is worth 40%. Welborn makes the assessments quite difficult and then applies a generous curve afterwards, which is not my preferred grading style. I also was disappointed that Welborn did not hold open office hours or have consistent appointment scheduling windows; this definitely created an accessibility barrier. If you enjoy calculus and deriving more complex versions of the firm competition models from 21, then this class is for you.

Welborn always had some great information to share about the chapter problems and had some funny comments, but most of this was self-taught memorizing the book. I wouldn't call this flipped since there aren't lectures outside of class (like Lewis does in econ20 with his prerecorded videos, or Doyle does with Econ21 to fill in the gaps) \u2013 it's just read the book and come in with the homework done, everyone reviews the answers together, he puts his answer key on canvas and we're done for the day. Welborn is a great academic \u2013 I became his research assistant because I liked working with him \u2013 and anytime there was a doubt on the homework he would confer with Snyder to see if there was a typo (there often was, the textbook isn't perfect). He was always willing to hear students out, but you had to approach first and set up a time, and he would only accept that request if he felt it would be beneficial (I was denied a meeting after midterm one because there were a lot of people requesting meetings and he thought we could all improve using the text and the midterm solutions).

The one thing I have to complain about this class were the exams. They were definitely much trickier than I expected. They were not especially difficult, but I feel the way some of the questions were phrased and the very broad nature of the topic and the answers made it difficult to come up with t he very specific answers that Edmonds is looking for.

            "review 17: \"07F with Eric Edmonds: I had pretty mixed feelings about this class. The material was definitely interesting, and it was certainly a departure from the norm as far as econ classes go. However, one thing to keep in mind, is that it lacked very little \"human\" aspect to the material; it was basically economic concepts and ideas applied to people living in poor countries. If you want to know more about the history of development and some real-world examples of how it takes place over time, consider something in the Geography department instead (like 6 or 17). Edmonds was a pretty good lecturer; his slides were clear and he was decent at conveying the material in class; he was also pretty receptive to questions during lecture as well. He was occasionally funny and sarcastic, picking on people and making random comments about drinking on Wednesday nights, which was certainly entertaining. However, outside of class, he definitely made himself available in office hours, but I always felt like I was a burden on his time -- he would answer my questions, but he never seemed particularly warm or friendly. I think that he was pretty overwhelmed with a lot of the outside research that he was doing, so he was also apt to be somewhat delayed in responding to blitzes, if he ever responded at all. With regards to the structure of the course, I thought that the midterm was pretty fair and that the final was WAY more difficult. The problem sets were basically only checked for completion, and we also had to do a few policy briefs, which were basically summaries of different issues in developing nations. As long as you put some effort into them, you could easily get a check (which is the best you could do), and these two components made up 20% of your grade, which was helpful. We also had a final research project and presentation, which was interesting to research and a definite diversion from the standard econ-type course stuff, and it was also a nice grade booster at 10% of the final grade.\"",
            "review 18: \"07F with Eric Edmonds: Great course--really interesting, but not too much work. One Midterm, biweekly problem sets graded on completion only, 3 policy briefs (2-page essay/reports also graded on completion), a group paper/presentation, and a final. About 75% of the material for the two exams comes directly from the problem sets and the practice tests. Focus on the concepts and not memorizing specific cases or graphs and you'll do well. You really don't have to do any of the reading, just pay attention to the lectures and the assignments. The concepts of this course overlap a lot with models from international economics courses, so econ majors will probably not have to put in as much time as non-majors, but even non-majors shouldn't need to spend more than a few hours a week. This was a fabulous course because you can get a ton out of it without having to put an excessive amount of time in. Edmonds is great--very responsive to students, and even tried to learn all our names, which wasn't easy with 3 full sections of the course. I would recommend this course to anyone--it really helps you understand why the problems with development are so hard to fix, and why the most common approaches to solve those problems have failed. But then there's a little hope too--we all did a group paper proposing a project for a developing country that would help one aspect of development, and there were a ton of great ideas that sounded incredibly promising. Take it! you won't regret it.\"",
            "review 19: \"07F with Eric Edmonds: The material is really interesting and relevant to issues that are frequently addressed (and often misunderstood) by the media. It is more qualitative than a standard econ class, but Edmonds definitely relies heavily on empirical research to make his point. The tests are not too hard, but you basically need to regurgitate exactly what Edmonds wants. The only problem with the class was Edmonds. He gives pretty good lectures, but sometimes his humor is a bit inappropriate (he mocks students quite a bit, although he isn't mean-spirited). He also targets specific students, but then again he is nice to those who come to class and try. He isn't bad--just a bit juvenile for a prof, in my opinion.\"",

There are a few problems sets and policy briefs (page long papers) but they're all graded very easily on a check/check minus basis (so you basically just have to complete them).

I did learn a lot about regressions, RCTs, and stats. Novosad is also clearly knowledgeable about the subject and assigns interesting readings. However, he's kind of an odd dude and will smile eerily at the wrong times (like when talking about India's slums or dying children), speak in a pretty condescending way if someone asks a question he doesn't think is good, and not explicitly teach or review material he covers in his tests. Novosad cold calls on the readings so to avoid that volunteer to speak early on in the term because he'll write that down and not call on you. I ended up doing well, but this course ate up a lot of my time and energy. My tips for an A are 1. really review the lecture notes and have a solid grasp of all the case studies and models covered because a lot of the tests (55% of your grade) are little details from his lectures, 2. pick a good group for the policy memos/presentations, 3. understand the empirical analysis because these long questions show up in every test and regressions are a useful skill to develop beyond the class. The final is optional and he strongly discourages people who are not in the bottom 10% from taking it as he sets the curve before then.

The questions were poorly written (especially the ones on the second midterm), and sometimes tested very small details from readings or discussion sections. The median on the first exam as an 80 while the median on the second was a 78, but luckily this class was curved. I'm not sure what the workload was like in-person, but it was consistently a very high workload this term (think ~20hrs/week). We had a group project due every week (except for week 1 and exam weeks), whether that was a presentation on an empirical paper or a 1-page policy memo. There are also a lot of assigned readings (although they are very fun/interesting!).

I understand that people make mistakes, but the recurrence of not knowing what you're teaching showed me that he was disorganized and did not review his lecture slides. Lastly, the reviewer below mentioned that Novosad gave us an optional extra assignment. I think it's important to mention that Novosad heavily discouraged students from doing the extra assignment - telling us that it would only benefit ~8 students out of 60 because you had to be near the bad part of the curve. I agree it's not hard to do well. My friends and I did well: I was simply baffled by the fact that Novosad heavily discouraged students from doing the extra assignment.

I will present all of econometrics in a presentation on day 2, hopefully this will scare off half the students, (I wonder why so many students dropped?) 6.) Last minute of class? I guess it\u2019s time to finish the 50 slides I still haven\u2019t covered 7.) I forgot #5 on this list and wonder why no one is presenting today and then realize they haven\u2019t been seen since day 2 8.) I won\u2019t give practice exams or tell you what type of questions will be asked 9.) I will give feedback on policy briefs only after students have submitted the next policy brief (I mean sure, it would have improved their second brief but we need a B+ median) 10.) Will go over advanced [PHD] concepts before telling the class its not necessary to know them 11.)

After studying for the final, I am a bit curious where all the time was spent in this class.

Now, my major gripe with this class is the tests. They are too easy. You just have to rewrite VERBATIM what you have learned in class. I mention verbatim because she is a teacher that looks for buzz words like \"credit crunch\" or \"devaulation\", and if you can mention these you will get median on the tests. To get an A, one must do the readings (there are about 3-5 per test and compromise about 40% of the test grade) and be able to remember the article very well, so you can answer questions about small points discussed in the article.

She didn't use PowerPoint; instead, she wrote everything on the board, but often times, she would go so incredibly fast that I felt myself simply trying to race to copy everything off the board without actually understanding what was going on, and this was especially the case towards the end of the lecture when she would run out of time (often because of drawn out class entertainment) and would fly through major topics in less than 5 minutes.

Someone who had read the textbook in advance could teach this class as well as Rose. The tests were reasonably fair, but Rose's grading was somewhat capricious. She always emphasized that she would give partial credit for showing your work even in incorrect answers, but in practice, she almost never gave any partial credit. Small math errors could cost you a lot of points on her tests. Aside from her poor grading, the tests themselves were a reasonably fair assessment of the material. Everything on the tests was directly from the textbook. This combined with the fact that Rose's lectures were straight out of the textbook meant there was no reason to go to class.

I did review some lectures for midterms on panopto which was helpful (but I also missed quite a few since I knew it'd be recorded). The midterms are very predictable if you just do all of the practice ones he posted, but he often takes classic repeating questions and changes one thing about them, so you really need to understand the process of getting to answers well (not just remember what answer goes with what question). The final was tougher since he doesn't give any full practice exams to review, but I found that going over the few questions he does give at TA office hours helped immensely. The avg scores are pretty high for the midterms, so to get an A you really need to grasp everything and be very precise with your answers. He's condescending at times and will say \"got it, okay let's move on\" when clearly no one gets it, but for the most part he explains concepts well.

The format would be around eight T/F questions that you had to explain to get credit, two/three short answer, then one long answer question.

            "review 24: \"08W with James Feyrer: Where to begin? This class taught me so much about the basics of macroeconomics and was extremely enlightening. The pace of the class is just about right and Professor Feyrer structures it so that the first part of the course is focused on the long-run economy and the second part on the short-run economy. He always connected the material in his lectures to world financial history and he occasionally brought up the current economic crisis. We also had the pleasure of attending a lecture by Danny Blanchflower about his work on the British Monetary Policy Committee. Professor Feyrer often changed his office hours so it was somewhat difficult to figure out when he was available. Although he never responded to my blitzes he did always read them. The only downside to this class, in my opinion, was that the exams were too easy. Consequently, the median grades tended to be extremely high so getting an A basically meant you had to master all the material and execute analysis flawlessly on the exams. This is especially difficult because his exams have True/False questions where he awards no partial credit. Still, staying afloat wasn't too difficult as long as you were careful on the exams. I would suggest this class even for non-majors. Of course you would have to trudge through Econ 1 to get here, but if you manage to survive that you should definitely take this class. It is much more interesting and pertinent to current events.\"",

To be honest, having thick skin is a valuable life skill, and I'm sure the real world is a lot tougher than enduring a few roasts from Comin. As likely known, this iteration of 22 is quite different from others \u2014 it's taught through a case method system, which I found to be really unique. Macroeconomics is so relevant to daily life, and I came out of this course with a much better standing of recent events and real-world phenomena. Comin's theoretical lessons can be confusing at times, especially when he's wearing a mask. However, what's most critical is to demonstrate effort that you are engaging with the material \u2014 a good chunk of the grade is participation which can be subjective, so participating as much as possible and going to office hours should help. I dedicated a lot of time to this course to ensure I understood the material, but Comin's workload is nothing unusual for an Econ class. While this class does have its drawbacks, I'm overall glad that I took 22 with Comin.

He claims that the midterms are meant to force students to study the models, but I did not feel either midterm assessed knowledge of the models representatively or well. Comin can definitely come off as rude and abrasive and sometimes he goes over a line, but generally you just need a thick skin. The case discussions were generally interesting although he looked for very specific things from them, so they were sometimes difficult to engage with, especially at first and I think they could have produced more value if he was not so focused on certain specifics. A lot of reviews in the past have said that he only gives participation to people that actually speak and you wont get credit if you have your hand up and are never called; I don't know if this is necessary true though, and my advice would just be try to participate as much as possible if you have anything of possible value prepared to say. The final case study was the most interesting part of the class for me, and I would definitely recommend giving yourself plenty of time to work on it because it appears short but is rather tricky and time consuming.

It can seem pointless at first, but unlike the people taking 22 with Comin, you will actually be able to explain real economic phenomena in the news, not just memorizing graphs you will never use again. In terms of practical knowledge, probably the best class I've ever taken. 3 project presentations are your entire grade, so if you don't like exams that is a plus. I am a big exam person and still found the class very enjoyable.\"",
            "review 2: \"20W with Andrew Levin: Worst class I\u2019ve taken at Dartmouth so far. I love Econ and so this class felt particularly wasteful. The basic idea of picking a country and analyzing a few important economic trends in it is really cool but really doesn\u2019t lend itself to Econ 22. He doesn\u2019t really lecture so nobody in the class knows any macroeconomics which leads to all the presentations being more or less the same and mostly pretty shallow. Additionally, the grading system is really wack, you\u2019re graded on 3 presentations which are only 3 page handouts. Often the people grading are TAs who aren\u2019t in class to watch the presentation and the grades are completely arbitrary with no comments to help you improve. He repeatedly says grades don\u2019t matter at all in this class but it\u2019s still curved to a B which means you\u2019re basically screwed unless he loves you and you suck up to him and even then maybe not. Overall a waste of time, came out of it learning nothing new while also taking a hit to my GPA\"",
            "review 3: \"20W with Andrew Levin: This class was... frustrating. Levin is a great guy, clearly an acclaimed economist and really one of the nicest profs I've had. But the way he designed this course was really irritating. As others have mentioned, pretty much the entire grade comes from three presentations (two, three-page handouts with a ten-minute oral presentation in class and one ten-minute video) and grades for collaboration/teamwork on these projects. You pick a country in the beginning of the class and present on it three times with a partner (you can pick your partner or go random). I knew much of this going in, and I like public speaking, so I thought that this would be a fun way to do 22. The problem is that each presentation is graded on a B median by TAs, so (a) you end up pouring time in just making your presentations look prettier and sound smarter than other people's and (b) the grade has basically nothing to do with your presentation skills, it's all about the contents of the handouts/video. The other problem is that Levin moves slowly and spends a ton of time on logistics, so he barely lectures. He gives really basic overview of macro concepts, and then gives easy quizzes on them, and these count for a tiny sliver of your grade. I know a lot about my country's economy now, but not a whole lot about macroeconomics. If you wind up taking this course, my advice would be to go hard on your first project and follow the rubric closely, and also to go to office hours with questions/drafts as often as possible to get edits/suggestions and to suck up. Get ahead on your projects and do a lot for your partner/partner teams so you get good feedback from them.\"",
            "review 4: \"20W with Andrew Levin: Terrible class. Yes, the workload is not heavy - only 3 presentations throughout the term with very low-stakes quizzes that he gives review questions for. But look forward to receiving very arbitrary grades on the presentations with no useful feedback and a large portion (92/398 points) of your grade determined by peer reviews that you will never have access to.\"",
            "review 5: \"19W with Andrew Levin: A big fan of this class. Instead of taking midterms, you and a partner have to give 3 presentations on a country of your choosing. There a couple quizzes - but they are all very straight forward, and all under 10 minutes. No midterms or finals! As well as being one of the leaders in his field (He was very senior at the FED), Levin is extremely passionate about his students and is always available to meet with you whenever you need help. He is also genuinely very interested in his students and wants them to work together as much as possible. The workload is manageable as long you do not things last minute - you do have to put in a lot of work into your presentations. This class is more about you and your fellow classmates teaching each other - I would not recommend taking this class if you do have a fairly strong macro+micro background and not that interested in Economics. If you are able to work in a team, enjoy economics, enjoy research, and willing to ask interesting questions - you will do very well in this class.\""

While our professor, Fahri Ulusoy, is a good lecturer and explainer, his lectures had frustratingly little interactivity. He hardly ever asked us questions, nor even if we had questions. He never had us solve problems in class, (as in do a worksheet). Ulusoy also could have given us more homework assignments. We only had 4 problem sets out of the Mankiw textbook (a great textbook by the way) worth of practice the whole term, so each one was worth about 5% of the grade. I accidentally forgot to turn in one problem set and was afraid my grade would be ruined, but Ulusoy was very nice about giving me credit. In fact, I took five photos of the homework with my phone and Ulusoy was kind enough to print out each individual photo and staple them together and give me full credit. I appreciate that. There were two midterms and a final. The first midterm was super easy. As a result Ulusoy made the second midterm and final somewhat tricky. He also graded the free response a little to subjectively in a few cases. For example, he would ask for three important differences between CPI and GDP deflator and if you listed three that weren't what he considered the most important, you would only get partial credit. Everything was fairly double. I simply read over my notes, occasionally read parts of the Mankiw textbook, and did the practice exams that Ulusoy posted on Canvas and was able to score pretty decently. Lastly in Fall 2016 when I took ECON 22, it was offered as a 1.5 hour 10A block, so even though the material wasn't uninteresting, I began to see it as so after passively being lectured at for an hour and a half.

The problem sets are graded for completion which is really nice, however, these end up just becoming the curve (she doesn't curve individual tests). The issue with this style is that during class, Petre just repeats exactly what she said in the recorded lectures, down to using the same exact examples. If you ask for different examples she usually won't give you one. Her example problems are also much, much easier than the problem set problems and the tests. Also, Fridays are just used as \"problem set days\" where you are put into groups to discuss the pset.

Her exams often test the material in ways you've never seen them applied before, however if you focus on the concepts you should be able to figure out what she is looking for.

I really appreciated that he ensured the class understood the connections between math and intuition. It is not too difficult to do well in the class as long as you ensure you understand why you are doing everything and spend sufficient time on the problem sets (including repeating questions). He was always super understanding and helpful if you talked with him before/after class or during office hours about any content problems or other issues. He gives plenty of chances for everyone to speak during class even if people are shy (he makes sure no one talks too much). The pop-quizzes really are not scary at all; he just wants to see that you can recall any little bit from the text-book or class, and he would often help people along.

            "review 4: \"21F with Erzo Luttmer: I would recommend taking this class with Professor Luttmer. The workload is not bad at all and assuming you pay attention in class, put effort into the problem sets, and make sure you review and understand the lecture notes he posts on canvas, you should come out with a solid understanding of the course material. Luttmer is very organized, very accommodating, and always has lots of availability for office hours and extra help. In terms of grading, most of your final score comes from the midterms and final. There are three midterms - the highest score counts for 20%, the second highest for 15%, and the lowest is dropped. The final counts for 40%. The assessments are not horrible, but they are entirely free response and sometimes if you miss a section, it can really take off a lot of points. That presents an issue for the final since that score can't be dropped and accounts for a huge portion of the grade. Likewise, usually the first part of assessments have lots of definitions, while the later questions are math-based. There's a lot of calculus in this course, including basic multivar. like partial derivatives, so make sure early on you get a handle on the math or you will struggle. The rest of the class is based on participation. From my memory, this score factors in problem sets (graded for completion), in class participation (just make sure to show up for class and frequently contribute), three discussion responses (graded for completion), and pop quizzes. The pop quizzes were intimidating at first, but after a little while you begin to figure out that he just wants to see evidence that you did the textbook reading (typically between 10 and 30 pages for each class MWF). Students would not get the question correct all the time but he would still award credit often when it was clear they put in effort. He didn't make the numerical grading rubric public until the week before the final. For us, it was 95-100 A, 90-95 A-, 85-90 B+, etc. This class is not a layup and it's probably difficult to count on being able to get an A in the class, since even if you were to get a 100 on everything else, botching one section of the final and getting less than an 88 on the final would mean an A-. However, I believe if you put in the effort an A- is very attainable and a B+ is definitely doable.

There were four quizzes throughout the term on every other Friday that were one part short answer (definitions) and two parts long answer (math problems). The final was the length of two quizzes. Luttmer was friendly, energetic and eager to help anyone who needed it. Make sure you do the reading and show up to class prepared--he can tell if you don't and will call you out.

This isn't too bad. Second midterm rolls around. I start freaking out, because stuff isn't making sense and I have little in my notes other than pages and pages of math with no explanations. Well, Professor Sessions tells us that the highest of the two midterms can count for our entire midterm grade (60% of the final grade, originally 30% each). Oh yeah, and it's a take home, so half the class is probably going to cheat. Well, I opt to not take the second midterm and just use my grade from the first midterm to carry me to the final. I figure I'll go into it with a B+/A- and hope I break the median and push myself into A- range. WELL. Professor Sessions then hits us with the bombshell that the final is optional and we can use our highest midterm grade as our final grade. It can only help us if we choose to take it, etc. etc. He then tells us that he'll send home a sheet with our current standing ASAP so we can decide if we want to take it. Confused by this, since there are now two midterms and two groups of kids (half the class each time) who has a grade above the median, I ask him if the B+/A- dividing line would be at the median on either of the two tests. He says yes. Then he says the median has fallen on the first midterm after people dropped the class. I figure I'm now above the median sitting with a comfortable A-. No final for me, right? Well he finally gets around to sending out everyone's current standing at around 2 PM the day before the 8 AM midterm. A-? Nope, C+. Say what? I freak out. He didn't see this coming? I specifically brought up in class that there were now too many kids with grades above the median, and if he was going to do a normal bell curve again, the new 'median' would be a grade above one of the two medians on one of the two midterms. He doesn't respond to blitzes, everyone is freaking out. I wasn't planning on taking the final and hadn't studied at all. I start cramming and show up the next morning on no sleep. Everyone complains that they've been deceived and he agrees to rework the distribution. Lovely, but why couldn't he have done this the night before and admitted his mistake before I killed myself preparing for a test I never intended to take? A roller coaster of a class due to a communication breakdown between the students and the teacher.

But when you spend several entire classes on Lagrange Multipliers, only to have basically none of that stuff appear on your first midterm - that should tell you something about your teaching. The biggest complaint was the prof's grading. He was very good about listening to people, and working to make sure that everything was right, but I found it kind of odd that he initially had a bell-curve scheme in his grading - with a lot of people getting C's and even D's (which are basically unheard of here). He supposedly fixed that though. I really want to say that Sessions was a great professor, since he was a pretty funny guy, and an all around cool British dude. However, there was something about his lecture style such that the material didn't really *click* with me in time for the exams. I had to teach myself most of the stuff from the book.

He understands that most people zone out after too much math-based producer theory, so he does a good job of breaking up the monotany in class. Overal, he's a fun guy, but not the greatest econ teacher on the planet. His grading system is seriously messed up, though. His course assessment consisted of an in-class mid-term, a take-home mid-term, and an optional final. The original plan was to value each mid-term at 30% and the final at 40%. However, he decided to get fancy and made it so that your grade is EITHER the highest of your two mid-term scores relative to the median OR the highest of your two mid-term scores relative to the median (60%) plus your optional final score relative to the median (40%). This system drastically favors people who did extremely well on one mid-term and failed the other. For example, if someone got 90% on MT1 and didn't even take MT2, they would outscore someone who got 80% on both. In my case, my highest grade was on MT2 and I didn't take the final, so my entire grade was based on an exam that only covered 3 weeks worth of the material. Seriously fucked up. But don't count on this helping you: I know a few people got on the wrong end of this system, and their grades show it. Overall, solid course, funny but average prof, and wacky grading.

Students in the class made a habit of printing out study material from the other professor's website, since she provided more resources for her students. Debopam's lectures were essentially worthless. I attended class for the first few weeks until I realized that I was wasting my time. Debopam makes the simplest concept complicated. Considering the cost of a Dartmouth education, it really sucks when you feel you are not getting your money's worth. I have spoken with friends who had taken the course with other professors and they seemed to be much better off. Supposedly, if you have taken Math 30 before taking Econ 20 with Debopam, then you will be in tremendous shape. At least that's what a trusted friend told me. My advice is to take the course with another prof, if you can fit it into your schedule. Otherwise, Debopams exams are 10 multiple choice questions, open book and open notes.

This is probably a bad thing because her tests tend to be tricky and long, even though they are open-book open-note. She was also really harsh in grading the projects.\"",
            "review 2: \"09F with Patricia Anderson: Summary: Course: A- Professor: B Most people take this course because they are Economics majors and they must. However, that is NOT the only good reason to take it. The statistical methods covered are useful, interesting, and in high demand by many employers. More than that, though, they provide you a powerful way of looking at the world through data and inference, one that I find absolutely fascinating. The class is a very thorough journey through basic and intermediate econometrics, and it is built entirely around multiple regression analysis. Professor Anderson is knowledgeable and is good at explaining econometrics in both plain and technical language. However, her attitude was often negative and sometimes outright unhelpful. Overall, while the course is fairly difficult and requires you to be at least somewhat quantitatively oriented, the skills it provides are incredibly useful. If you can push through the math and appreciate the power of statistics, it can be very enjoyable! The Professor Professor Anderson is a mix of good and bad. On the positive side, she is adept at explaining the material in a variety of ways. She can talk theory and formulas with the best of them, but she prefers a more grounded approach that is intuitive to those of us who are not completely comfortable with math. She is decently responsive in class, and she moves at an excellent pace, summarizing the previous lecture at the beginning of each class to help you segway into the next. On the negative side, she has a bit of an attitude problem. She is not the most riveting lecturer, and she often becomes awkwardly negative when we fail to respond to her jokes and attempts at classroom discussion. With a subject as potentially dry as econometrics, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to tolerate too much of that negativity. Overall, though, she does a good job of conveying the material in a way that is thorough and intuitive. The Course The class covers everything you always wanted to know about econometrics but were afraid to ask. It is based entirely around regression analysis, including interpretation of results, ways to test models for problems such as heteroskedasticity or functional form problems, how to correct for those problems, and how to use different types of estimators (OLS, fixed effects, probit, etc.) in different situations. Though it covers quite a bit of material fairly quickly, the class if organized in a logical way and is reasonably easy to follow if you keep up with the material on a day-to-day basis. Three very important notes: (1) Many people skipped class this term, but I would advise against that. The extra insight and opportunities to ask questions in class helped me tremendously. (2) The book is extremely helpful! When I took ECON 10, I never used the book, but not so with ECON 20. It features not only detailed descriptions of the derivation of formulas (not so useful) but also qualitative, intuitive discussions of how to use them (very useful!). (3) Anderson posts several practice tests to help you study for exams. Do them! I learned more from those tests (which I often failed on the first try) than I did from any other single aspect of the course. I have to include a note defending econometrics against the inevitable accusations that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dry\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or that you should only take this class \u00e2\u20ac\u0153since you have to.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Econometric theory is, in and of itself, admittedly quite dry. But only when you start getting your hands dirty in the data do you realize the true power of statistics to inform our understanding of the world. How else could you answer questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many years does smoking a pack per day shave off your life?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is the projected demand for electricity in 20 years?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Statistics allows you to make VERY educated guesses about interesting and complex questions that you could not answer with direct observation. In essence, it allows you to see more than your senses will allow. This course gives you a great overview of many useful econometric techniques, and for me it was far from boring. Besides, apply for any consulting or economic research job, and you will quickly find that econometrics (and literacy in Stata, which this course uses heavily) is in high demand. Grading The course had two mid-terms, each worth 25%, and a final worth 35%. These were fair and thorough exams that did a good job of assessing our knowledge of the topics covered, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A group paper takes up 10%, along with a final 5% of your grade for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153participation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which essentially means reading articles, doing problem sets, and coming to class with answers prepared for both.\"",

            "review 21: \"02F with Patricia Anderson: First, I'll give credit where credit is due. Although I hated econ 20 with a passion, Patty A was always available to help me understand the admittedly difficult material. However, she wasn't the most inspirational professor I've ever had. Her lectures were pretty dull most of the time and the powerpoint presentations follow the book a little too closely (in fact, they're posted on the book's website). So essentially, if you don't understand the book, you probably won't understand her. As for the book, I personally think it should be banned. Seriously, I think there were more greek letters and equations in that book than actual writing explaining what the equations meant. If you have a talent for calculus and find math intuitive, then this class should be much easier for you. For the rest of us, however, this class was painful. The class will kill your GPA faster than any course on the campus (with the possible exception of orgo). The reading's dull, the lecture's are dull, and the professor is dull. To make matters worse, the material is exceedingly difficult. I believe the median grade for our first exam was a 68... with a 20 point curve! If it wasn't required for the major, I would definitely never have even considered taking it. Based on my experience and the advice of older classmates, I would suggest putting this class off as long as possible. I made the mistake of taking econ 1, 10, and 20 right in a row... and seriously considered dropping the major because these classes haven't been particularly enjoyable. However, I have been told this is the worst it gets. By far. Other econ classes are much more fun. Besides, I think taking this class right before taking a 40-level class would be more helpful than taking it several years before you will need econometric skills. I wish I would have only audited this class now and actually taken it for a grade as a senior. My grade would probably have been higher and I think it would have helped me more. As is, I think I'll have to audit the class again before taking a 40-level class. But if you have to take this class with Patty A (curse Chandra for leaving us), make sure to do all the problem sets and pay particular attention to the discussion problems presented in class. As for the final project, it is helpful to start at least two weeks before it's due, but if you start much earlier, you won't have learned enough material to complete it and you'll wind up having to change your models and thesis and everything. Go to office hours early and go often. Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions (I guarantee 98% of the class is wondering the same thing). For exams, I think it is most helpful to use PA's study guides in order to review concepts. They're concise and clearly define principles you might not have understood in class. And be sure to review problem sets and class discussion problems, as many test questions are simply variations on these. Above all, go into this class knowing it will be difficult but survivable. Hope for the best, but don't be terribly disappointed if this class kicks your butt. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life, and the pathetic thing is that this is the worst I have ever done at any subject. On the plus side, if you make it through this class, nothing will scare you ever again.\"",

In some cases it looked as if she had just copied phrases out of the book into her slides. And while we saw demonstrations of how to do everything in Stata, they were ALL THE SAME except one little difference. When you've learned 20 different things that are all almost the same, it gets tough to remember which is which. This course demands lively, exciting examples - a walkthrough of a sample project BEFORE ours was due would have been a very nice thing. It certainly would have helped me out. The one good thing I can say about this course is that the homeworks were representative of the exams. In fact, the exams just gave us Stata output and asked us to interpret it and discuss the assumptions that underlied it.

The practice exams were 100 times more helpful than any other sort of studying, so definitely leave yourself tons of time to do all of them. The class lecture material could be pretty complex day to day, but the practice exams made it clear which material you actually needed to know, and what was just him proving something that was unnecessary ( and 75% of the class understood almost none of).

The class used Stata, which is a widely used tool for statistical analysis (sort of similar to R) We only learned Stata from powerpoints and a few questions on problem sets. In other words, we didn\u2019t learn much Stata. The textbook was different from the lectures and much more dense. The problems in the textbook were very different from the exams. Hence it was hard to prepare for exams except using the two practice tests provided for each exam. Professor Dinkelman was approachable and did a good job answering students questions. Overall though, if you have the opportunity to take the class with Prof. Ethan Lewis or another prof who structures the class better, do it.

Lewis really walks you through STATA, so you don't need any experience going in. There is lots of time in class to work on STATA stuff. The group project and individual project use STATA, but there is so much help that it's not a problem. Material: Seems difficult at first, but this class does not really focus on the Math behind the statistics, just how to do them and interpret the results. The lecture notes provide all the gory detail if you want it for interest, but you don't need any of it for exams. There are 4 Quiz/Midterms throughout the term, dropping the lowest of the 4. Lewis's Multiple Choice/True-False are pretty difficult and it definitely takes a while to get the hang of them, so you really need to do the practice exams (of which he provides plenty).

His exams take some getting used to, and it will hurt you dearly if you get many multiple choice wrong. He makes up for it by giving straight forward free responses, though you're usually in a crunch for time by the time you get to those. The final was a lot better and not as time pressured. For the first midterm, a good econ 10 background (preferrably with Lewis) probably helps. After that, everything is new, and econ 10 concepts aren't really tested. A good thing about this class is that he isn't too big on STATA, and doesn't include STATA problems on the exams. Overall, I recommend this prof. but beware that his exams will be tough.

The course just required a good amount of outside review before the concepts made sense. Lectures were extremely difficult to understand in class but would usually make more sense looking back at them. I don't think Zitzewitz is necessarily the issue with econ 20 being hard. Rather, the course is poorly set up and difficult. One thing to note is that Zitzewitz does not emphasize stata and merely hands you the commands on your ungraded data exercises. This may be an issue in upper-level courses.\"",

He only has one example/explanation for each concept, so if you don't understand his explanation you're screwed. This class also has very few practice problems, and many of the conceptual exercises are stolen from Professor Lewis. Furthermore, he completely confused the class on first differences versus fixed effects, leaving people believing that first differences and changes on changes are different from each other and fixed effects. Also don't read the textbook (but mastering 'metrics is a decent read and is actually relevant to the class so I would recommend reading that). Moreover, I completely disagree with the person who said they felt confident in their econometric skills. Zitzewitz did not teach us how to use STATA; he merely gave a quick 5-minute tutorial and then handed out the first data exercise for us to complete. Another example of the complete lack of STATA in this class is that he gave a list of boolean operators and then expected everyone to know how to use them correctly. I think he expects you to \"pick up\" STATA by looking at the regressions he runs in his lecture slides, and I know that I have absolutely zero STATA knowledge going into my 40s-level course. The few redeeming qualities of this course is that there is no final group project and because you use the first 2 x-hours, the class ends week 9 with the final worth 40% of your grade. Additionally, the median was a predetermined B+, so even if you got a 58% on the first exam, your score would be curved up.

I try really hard to like them and try to adjust to their teaching style. However, this professor - while he may know his stuff and have written tons of papers - seriously lacks in the teaching department. His lectures consisted of him flipping through the book, trying to figure out where to begin, and he complained about how the book was set up yet he still decided to use it. The syllabus given in class was totally incorrect, and I had no idea about the organization of the class. The worksheets he gave out would have been helpful except that the answers were totally incorrect. While he gave us practice exams, sometimes he would not even give us the answer key even though he only partially went over the exam in class. Luckily, I come from a statistics oriented family so I instead emailed the worksheets and exams to my parents, and they gave me the correct answer key instead and tried to explain the material to me over the phone. It was only through my parents that I actually learned the material - which was a TOTAL waste of my tuition. The class may be easy to get a decent grade in (previous median grades for this class have been an A-), but I came out of this class, learning almost NOTHING from the professor. I seriously wonder how this professor has been teaching this class for such a long time, because I doubt that he knows actual statistics. He seems to have the most joy out of doing stuff on STATA (the program in which we \"learn\" how to use), but he failed to recognize or did not WISH to recognize that somehow the rest of the class was not getting the same regression results as he was. His office hours were Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 - 8:45 AM - obviously placed at that time so that nobody would disturb him.

Some of those projects included a statistical study linking sex and happiness and an article debunking a pop-statistics study about the link between attractiveness and income. These case studies help keep the class from turning into a dull evaluation of whether A is a predictor of B and so on.

Blanchflower runs the course at an admittedly brisk pace, and this is probably the reason for the vitriolic reviews. Rather than just memorize a heap of formulas, the material is presented in a progressive logical fashion in a form utterly lacking the theoretical jumble of letters and symbols of the way the subject is taught from textbooks. By the end of the course I found that I had an intuitive understanding of statistics that was far more valuable than an overload of formulas. Blanchflower is genial friendly and funny, and made a serious and successful effort to make the class revolve outside of the classroom. He frequently had afternoon class sessions where he bought pizza for three class sections; he had a barbeque/swimming party at his house for the entire class.

However, if you go into office hours, he will cater to your individual needs and doesn't sound like a textbook when he does so.

I haven't heard of one kid yet who has had a good Econ 10 experience. Professor Lewis flies through the material really quickly so its important to pay attention and on top of things because its really hard to catch up if you don't get the basics down. The professor isn't bad and he tries, but I don't think his lectures were that effective in conveying the material. He is available for help during office hours (which I strongly recommend taking advantage of) and for scheduled appointments. The book we read wasn't of much use either. The grades in the class come from 4 quizzes, a midterm, final, and problem sets. The quizzes and tests are open book, but it doesn't help as much as you think it would. They are broken up into long problems and multiple choice/true and false. The long problems aren't too bad and straight forward, but the short answer can be really tricky and really want you to understand the details really closely. Professor Lewis also tries his best to trick you. The problem sets are just based off the class work and are graded only for completion. I suggest doing them so that you understand the material for the quizzes and tests. Also its important to know that grades in this class are distributed based on percentage quota, meaning a certain percent of the class will get an A, B+, B, etc\"",

These are extremely helpful and fun, and you should use them to get to know Lewis as well. He seems a bit distant in class, but when you engage him in discussion, he's a really dynamic person. As for grading, I thought the mid-term and final were very effective at comprehensively assessing our understanding of the material. The homework was EXTREMELY helpful, so you should always spend time on it even if you do nothing else. I found the four quizzes to be too challenging. They consisted almost entirely of \"trick\" questions, and as a whole, they didn't assess our overall understanding of the material. However, he weights your quiz grades based on how much effort he thinks you put into the problems sets, so it balances out. Overall, a solid course. You'll find yourself applying statistics to everyday life and seeing things in a new way, which is always cool. For those of you who are not taking this class just for the major, I still recommend it. The statistical tools you learn here will come in handy in the hard and social sciences, not to mention the next time you pick up the newspaper and wonder if that groundbreaking study is really legit.\"",

I found the final to be a killer, and that definitely dragged my overall grade down considering it's a whopping 40% of our grades. Lectures were somehow very very ineffective (for me and many of my friends). Perhaps because the material is dry, everyone is in a coma. But also because Lewis tends to skip around a bit. I would look back into my notes and find that he touched upon confidence intervals briefly--and then go deep a couple of classes later. Also, he repeats a lot of stuff in his lectures but not word for word, so I'd have pages and pages of notes on the same exacts things (ex: all the different Assumptions towards the end of the term). So the notes really wasn't very effective. It could be 1) condensed 2) more organized Visit Lewis during office hours if you need help. It helps a lot. And I found this class to be very relaxed until the last 3 weeks or so. It moved incredibly slow in the beginning, and even half-way through, we only did 1 problem sets and 2 quizzes, which didn't require daily work at all--just some studying the night before and getting with study groups. So overall, this course isn't that much work until the very end--mainly because the material gets harder. And by the way, I never took statistics before. I came in not having any idea what a \"normal distribution\" was. I never even worked with Excel before (ok I know, pretty lame). So I found myself at a disadvantage with people in the class who took stats in high school and knew about p-values and hypothesis testing already. So the only good thing about this class is I learned A LOT. And it's definitely worth the thousands of dollars my parents are putting into for my education.

The grade comprised the final exam (a whopping 40%), a midterm exam (20%), four quizzes (25%, or 6.25% per), four problem sets (10%, or 2.5% per), and participation (5%). Also, the last two quizzes and the final exam were substantially more difficult (and time-consuming) than the practice quizzes and practice final that Prof. Lewis had given us. Professor Lewis is definitely enthusiastic when he teaches, especially given the generally dry nature of the discipline of statistics, but he often either goes through information too quickly or goes over a topic in snippets over several class sessions so that it becomes difficult to synthesize/summarize the material for that topic. He is generally a quick grader. Problem sets can be EXTREMELY time-consuming, so plan to spend at least around 5 hours on each.

How anyone ever gave her a PhD in anything beyond 80's valley girl talk is beyond me. Professor Hastings doesn't respect Dartmouth students, rather, the majority of her examples deal with how much smarter UCLA kids are becuase they don't have grade inflation so you actually have to earn an A. Furthermore, she is most unhelpful during office hours, I asked her a question at the begining of the term and her response was, \"Yep\" after which she said nothing and proceeded to stare at me until I left her office. That said, her class requires little work during the term. No homework is collected and you are graded on 3 exams. The first two are relatively fair and curved. The final, however, was 1.5 hours long instead of the required 2, was nothing like the book problems, problems done in class, or practice exams. Most Econ 10 classes are open book/open note, but with her you don't even get as much as a formula sheet for the pages of formulas that you have to use.

Often I found that people complained about Prof. Hastings, but they just didn't show up to class enough for their comments to be justified.

You think I'm kidding, but I only wish that were the case. She once said the following, and I quote verbatim: \"Did you all bring your journals today? YAY!\" 3) She seems unsure of the material that she's teaching, and frequently has to stop in the middle of writing something on the board to fix mistakes she's made. She comes late and unprepared, demanding that the students bring calculators so that they can provide numbers that she should already have with her. The highpoints? Well, I dozed off in class, did all the reading the day before the midterms and final, and aced the class without breaking a sweat.

Prof. Barr wants to do a good job, but he cannot teach worth his life. I cannot even count how many times he confused the whole class with his round-about examples and antiquated jokes. He's horrible at answering questions. When asked to solve a problem from the hw, he starts fine but then confuses himself in his own nervousness. It's almost painful to watch because you know he knows that he's confusing everyone so you just want him to stop suffering. That's why I stopped going to class after the midterm. After realizing I could learn everything I needed from the book I realized I didn't need to suffer nor did I need to watch him suffer in class. Barr's the kind of guy u meet at a party and afterwards think to yourself, \"wow, it really is possible to be 35 and to retain your innocence\". I even heard some girls say \"awww...he tries so hard doesn't he? he's so sweet\". He's a really nice guy. I actually feel like a bad person for giving him a negative review. I hope this is anonymous. As for the workload, the hw is ridiculously tedious but not very hard at all. The exams were fair. He also gave us practice exams before each test (midterm and final) to give us an idea as to what would be on the test. Their material was pretty similar to the test's actual composition.\"",

Blanchy aka Danny Boy (what he refers to himself as) is something else. He is a well known economist and he will never let you forget it. If I hear one more thing about his house in Sanibel Island Florida I might die.

If the self-absorbed professor archetype rubs you the wrong way, you will resent walking into Rocky by day 3. But if your goal at Dartmouth, or in a given term, is to find a stupidly easy class and/or fill this distrib, and you can synthesize the material (i.e. the few minutes of actual econ per class \u2014 he\u2019s actually a decent lecturer, when the topic isn\u2019t himself) back into an essay that agrees with his beliefs, then this is the class for you.

Lastly, if you take away nothing else from these reviews: I have NEVER seen worse essay prompts from any class, EVER. This is especially poignant because the two essays (a puny <1000 words each, and btw you should write them somewhat in the style of an op-ed, namely a Blanchflower op-ed) comprise the whole grade. Here are some examples: \u201cWhat has happened to well-being over the last decade?\u201d (24s) \"What does past experience since the Second World War tell us about the current state of the US economy?\" (24s, which was changed from) \"What is the state of the US economy in 2023?\" Really dude? 23f: \"Has the US solved its inflation problem?\" (the least embarrassing one; at least it\u2019s something you can sort of take a stand on) followed by: \"Describe the changes to the labor market in the years 2008-2023.\" These are high-schoolers\u2019 ChatGPT prompts, not rhetoric-encouraging thought provokers.

The amount of out of class work was on the low end which was nice (two 500 word essays and some readings you didn't really have to do). I should say that this class wasn't really a lecture based class. If you come and sit in the back and passively listen or online shop, you probably won't get much out of it. On the other hand, if you come and engage by asking questions or making arguments based on current events you can get a fair amount out of the class. I think the issue is that some people didn't really understand the structure of the class and expected daily lectures. I agree with the previous reviewers that Prof Blanchflower is certainly a bit eccentric and has an ego--but for good reason. He is a world renowned economist and knows his stuff. I agree that some of his paper's titles are a bit click-baity. The papers you write do not have to agree with his opinions but you have to base your argument on evidence (like any class).

For each of the papers he\u2019s held office hours if you wanted to discuss your idea with him before writing. The class was entirely 2 800-word papers. As long as you are capable of some economic interpretation and follow his guidelines (i.e. word count, # of graphs/tables needed), I\u2019d say it\u2019s really easy to get an A. There are barely any readings (40 odd pages every few weeks) and if even if you don\u2019t read them, it\u2019s fine because he goes over it in class. Also this isn\u2019t a basics of econ class. If you\u2019re looking for that you probably won\u2019t enjoy this class. Blanchflower talks about what\u2019s going on in the economy currently and his own research.

He does cold call but it isn\u2019t graded and he doesn\u2019t really care if you get the question right as long as you make an effort.

Blanchflower has no curriculum for this course, instead opting to babble about whatever he wants each day, which a lot of the time consists of social pseudo-science that seems to discount the principle of correlation not always equalling causation (one highlight was his talk about how \"women's happiness is complicated\"). He neglects to build a foundational knowledge of economics despite this course being targeted towards people coming in with little to no econ experience, and as one of those people, I feel like I only left this class with \"Danny Boy's\" (yes he refers to himself in the third person very often) personal opinions rather than a toolkit with which I could look at the world critically. The two essays are basically a joke where he has you attempt to tackle problems that people spend their entire careers on in the span of 600-800 words, with the only stated expectations being for you to \"tell Danny a good story\" (ie. parrot back his own opinions at him). At first the class is entertaining since it seems Blanchflower is just doing the \"pretend to be a narcissist\" bit for some charming irony, but then it's week 9 and you realize he isn't pretending, he's playing favorites with the football players/aspiring econ bros, and you've learned jack shit. It's disgusting this man is tenured, and he's not even one of those \"bad at teaching great at research\" types.

Blanchflower is entertaining, but there is no real plan for class on any given day, and the 'entertaining' bit just kind of gets annoying after a while. He just goes on a stream-of-consciousness rant about what's happening in the economy that day (or about himself), and I left the class not even able to confidently explain inflation. As another person wrote, the only assignments in this class (on which your entire grade depends) are 2 short papers tackling questions that even the most well-respected economists have spent their careers trying to answer.

I was planning on taking it when Fishel was teaching, but it worked out that I took it with Blanchflower. I\u2019ll start off by saying that Blanchflower is a well known economist, and he will remind you of that constantly. Overall, he\u2019s an upbeat cheerful guy, and he\u2019s pretty easy to talk to. Class is basically just a discussion where Blanchflower talks and then cold calls people. I\u2019d never been in a cold call class before so I spent the first two weeks living in terror, but then you realize that there\u2019s basically no wrong answers and Blanchflower doesn\u2019t care how you answer, so then it\u2019s very chill. He does kind of play favorites in class, where there are 3-4 people he calls on way more than everyone else, but since participation doesn\u2019t count towards your grade, who cares. Your grade comes from two papers (1000 words each) each worth fifty percent. The paper topics were literally \u201cwhere is the economy now\u201d. Yes, both papers. The papers are very broad, so my advice is to just email him about whatever topic you pick and check it with him (or make a brief office hours meeting). He says there\u2019s no right answer for the papers, but he has a bias towards what he thinks is happening, so let him point you in the direction he wants. Honestly. you can go to class or not and it would literally make no difference. The papers are not related to in class material, so in theory if you really wanted to you could just never show up and still get an A.

I can tell you a little about interest rates and general things the feds might do, but otherwise nothing.

None of that matters when you're trying to learn the basics of economics. Blanchflower is also a complete narcissist and incapable of leading productive classroom discussion. The syllabus was a full page of links to his own articles and news appearances. There was no structure, no textbook. The assignments were last minute and had no prompt or instruction. Yes, they were short, but they also taught us nothing and you never had any idea what he expected. The only \u2014 and this not an exaggeration \u2014 course materials were his own book, and a few randomly chosen OpEds, also authored by him. Sometimes, to spice it up, he would bring in emails he wrote in response to fan mail. This conversational teaching style may be appropriate for an upper-level econ course, but not for an introduction where we are all trying to learn the basics of economics. He framed the class as a loose discussion of the global economic state but the problem is that in a class like econ 2, no one understands any basic economic principals so the class was collectively confused during most of each class session. Also, he often interrupted himself mid-sentence, repeated stories (and even repeated entire lessons). Honestly, I worry he is a bit senile. Lastly, Blanchflower is not capable of listening to students. On many occasions, he told the class he had never heard a student say something he didn't already know. If he called on you, he usually interrupted you a few words in in order to finish your point himself. Every question was leading, and had only one right answer. He made more than one student leave class because he made an inappropriate comment and was too busy listening to himself talk to realize he wasn't doing his job as a teacher.

He also posts previous exams and their answers so you get an idea as to the type of questions to expect on the exams. There are two midterms, one final, none of them being curved, but he helps you learn the material enough where you don't need a curve, just work problems from previous exams. There are occasional online workouts too. Benz is a great prof, who's great at answering any questions, he responds rather quickly to blitzes.

The test questions are tricky enough that you'll make enough careless errors to drop into the B range, so an A is ridiculously hard. Too many people want to take Economics. ONLY take this class if you think like an economist, and are dedicated to the field. If your parents are forcing you to be an Econ major, you'll drop this course. Bentz is an incredible professor, one of the smartest and most entertaining I've met. He is the ideal Dartmouth professor in every respect, and he inspires interest for the field. If you have to take Econ 1, take Econ 1 with Bentz. That said, the course appeals to the lowest common denominator. If you understand this stuff intuitively, you never have to attend class (unless you really like Bentz). If you pick it up quickly, class can drag on forever, and often gets bogged down with stupid questions. I felt like everything taught in the course could have been summed up in a day if you just sat down and talked to the prof one-on-one. Basically, if you are serious about Econ, take 1 with Bentz.

The course work isn't overbearing; you can keep up with the reading and do the weekly workouts without it taking a real hit on your amount of free time. Having said all of that, Bentz is a master at making his exams tricky. Not impossible, not overly challenging, just tricky.

            "review 35: \"05S with Andreas Bentz: This was a very very good class. Definitely not easy, though, and definitely a weeder class, easy to fall behind in if you slacked off. The concepts seem misleadingly simple. There's not much math involved, and the material usually makes sense intuitively, so the tendency is to feel better prepared than you are. Reviewing the slides is not enough, because the exams test both comprehension and application. It's really mostly a critical thinking class. Bentz's tests are notoriously hard, but they're hard in a fair way. If you miss a question, it's because you didn't understand a concept fully, and if you get him to explain it, it's very obvious what the right answer is and why. The best way to prepare for them is by practicing problems because that way you encounter little tricks that might show up on the tests. He doesn't make them too hard for people that really understand everything from class - if you know the material, you'll generally do well. But the tests really made me realize when I thought I'd understood something and didn't, fully. The one really annoying thing about the grading is the scale, which makes it really hard to get an A (95-100%), normal difficulty to get an A- (90-94%), and progressively easier as you go down. B+ = 85-90, B = 80 to 85, etc. The best thing to do in this class is to work problems & ask questions obsessively, to force yourself to learn and understand the material. It's not much work & not much to memorize, mostly just knowing how to apply. Studying in groups & explaining things to each other really helps. The book is very good and interesting and the chapters follow the subjects he talks about in class pretty well (because he was involved in the publication.) The book isn't necessary - class notes are enough - but it can be helpful in explaining concepts. Bentz is an excellent professor and really cares about helping students. He's also really smart, which can seem intimidating, but he's good at explaining concepts and making them make sense. His class is harder than the others but you also learn a lot more, & he's incredibly enthusiastic & makes the material really interesting. Apparently other profs don't go as much in depth into the material and class is not as interesting, but Econ 1 is still an excellent course and covers material that everyone should know.\"",

            "review 51: \"04W with Andreas Bentz: Professor Bentz opened his introduction to Econ 1 by warning the class that we would teach for intended majors. Econ 1 would be a difficult class, he warned us all; those of us with less than a passionate interest in Econ would do better to drop and enroll in Econ 2 instead. You shouldn't believe him. Econ 1--specifically, Bentz's Econ 1--was absolutely the highlight of my freshman winter, and is still one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth. If you take only one econ course at Dartmouth, make sure it's Econ 1 with Bentz. Hell, take it even if you're not planning on taking an Econ course at all. It's that good. You owe it to yourself. This course is, without a doubt, made excellent by Bentz. He's an all-around excellent professor--committed to his students, engaging in lecture, welcoming in office hours. He does an excellent job explaining topics that can be confusing and are frequently boring in a lively manner, and he prints power-point presentations for every topic that you can use in class for easy note-taking. Bentz makes learning Econ easy and fun, and he'll go to all lengths to make sure that you understand the material he presents in class. This is an important point, because (as Bentz warns) the class is not easy. The majority of your grade will come from two midterms and a final; six problem sets (none of which are easy) make up the last bit, but he drops the worst grade of the six. The tests are tough; you'll need to know the material well and be able to put it into practice to earn a good grade. But Bentz goes out of his way to make himself available during office hours, and hold review sessions before each test, so it's more or less your own fault if you don't understand the material well enough. The book is a little less helpful than Bentz. I found the readings were very helpful during the early parts of the course, especially since I came in with no prior Econ experience and was unfamiliar with a lot of the terms and concepts. However, later in the course, Bentz tends to teach in his own manner; the book technically covers the same material and the same problems, but tends to present things in a slightly different way, just different enough to be confusing. I don't believe Bentz makes you buy the book, so if you can borrow it at your leisure, don't spend the money. On the other hand, it's well written and rather entertaining, so if you simply enjoy acquiring textbooks, it'll be a nice addition to your bookshelf.

My only real complaint with Bentz was his grading system. He distributes test scores so that almost everyone gets a B-, B, or B+. The problem with this is that his tests are often not too difficult, so Bentz looks for any small mistakes so he can take points off and drag everyone down to some form of a B.

            "review 96: \"04F with Andreas Bentz: First of all, despite negative aspects of this class, DO NOT take this class from anyone but Bentz. I heard Giummo put his kids to sleep everyday, which I think is echoed in other reviews on this site, but it's kind of sad he hasn't read the reviews and tried to fix his lecture style. Second of all, if you are not a planned ECON major or have to take it for some other major, seriously consider taking ECON 2 (which Bentz kindly suggests to his students the first day of class). Bentz's lectures are entertaining and often interactive. His accent became a nice alarm clock in the morning, and his bad jokes about Economics professors were always entertaining. Overall, Bentz is a great guy, with the best interests of his students in mind. He really wants to make a difference at Dartmouth, and for a department that is known for its horrible professors (how can an entire department be notorious for bad professors -- President Wright or whoever hires these people??), Bentz is a breath of fresh air. I was nervious taking this class because I heard Bentz was harder, and I wish I had taken the advice of previous students to study for the exams by doing EVERY SINGLE practice exam Bentz provides. It might seem excessive, but extremely necessary. See this is the catch, Bentz is great and all, but he wants you to apply the stuff you learn in class on your own. So you can show up to the test and have to think about the dense theory behind Bentz's simple examples and apply it. So if you take the practice exams, you won't make the all-too-common mistake of being a student that undestands the material lightly, but falls for Bentz's very, very attractive \"sucker answers.\" In fact, as we learned in class, Bentz's opportunity cost of not writing SAT I sucker answers is probably much higer than the benefits of working at Dartmouth and receiving what is probably a meager salary for \"Visiting Assitant Professor\" compared to the disgusting, inflated salaries that the Parkhurst gods and their marble floors enjoy. I think Bentz should provide more difficult examples in class, or at the very least more workouts for students to play with the material. The book wasn't extremely necessary to read, and I did my best on the final when I didn't read the last section of the book, but I don't know if that is coincidental or not. It's kind of nice to read the book because it is basically verbatum what Bentz says in class, except for different examples. It was kind of sad to see him only mentioned once in the book when it was obvious he was a serious contributer. Despite any negativities, just being in Bentz's class is worth it, even if you only go to his office hours and play with his toy airplanes. So your choices are first: ECON 1 or not, then if it's Giummo/some other random versus Bentz, your decision is boring ECON 1, if a bit easier, or fascinating lectures and tougher exams. I would suggest facebooking Bentz, you could become his friend and ask more questions.\"",

Some tend to consider the field of study boring, but he brings a youthful tone and adds anecdotes and real-life situations that make the class and the subject interesting. His outline for the material is well-presented and summerized on his powerpoint slides: they provide good access for studying and homework, and make clear the material you need to know in the class. If you put consistent, quality effort into the homework, you will be well prepared for the exams, and will have an easier time comprehending the material. Be prepared for thorough exams: They take an above-average concentration and preparation, and tend to take up the full allotment of class time. The text book is questionable.

I take a lot of intro classes at this college, and hers is one of the best because of how learning-focused she is. Some profs phone in and half-ass intro classes, but not her. For context, I'm not an econ major, I'm just a person who felt like I shouldn't graduate college without any econ knowledge. Because of that, I'm a little frustrated that Econ1 is NRO ineligible, because I would've preferred focusing more on learning and less on assessment in this class. This term, assessment is based on participation, weekly P sets that never take that long (and you can even skip 1 without penalty), a midterm, two midterm Canvas quizzes that were open note, and a cumulative final exam during finals period. Exams/quizzes are a mix between short answer and multiple choice. The short answer questions are always easier, and the mutliple choice questions verge on the \"okay, I understand the topic of the question pretty well, but this question is a little pointlessly specific, vague, and difficult\". Ultimately, this class does a great job of introducing microeconomics concepts with a focus on intuition without the calculus. Prof Curtis is also a joy, and I recommend this course with her as the prof to anybody, econ major or not.

Expect the prof to make a bunch of mistakes when explaining key concepts, and expect to not catch them because you have drifted off. Reading the book is a good way to prepare for the multiple choice portions of tests (which are about half of problems); however, doing well on the assessments also depends on your ability to do mathematically-oriented questions of which you will have little solid preparation for. Going to review sessions is not really very helpful either, because as nice of a guy as Giummo is, you never actually do problems in the revew sessions, but rather listen as he lists the things you need to go figure out how to do.

The only flipped day was Friday when we would go over the week's problem set in small groups. Even though the video lectures were the same as the in-class lecture, I think it is really important to go to the in person lectures and watch the videos beforehand because the in-person lectures move very fast. There were 2 midterms and a final. Many of the reviews stated that the final was easier than the midterms, but I think a more accurate analysis is that they were all of a similar difficulty but time was much less of an issue on the final. On the midterms, time was a huge factor and there was no time to check any work. On the final, there was probably 20% more time per question, which allowed time to go back and check work. For the midterms, definitely make sure you know the concepts well because they are difficult and there isn't much time to think about the question and reason it out. The policy memo is not meant to cushion your grade and is graded pretty harshly. The assignments are all for completion as you can redo them as many times as you need to get 100%. Overall, I think Dr. Petre really cares about her students and will work with you to get the help you need and to understand any concept that is difficult. She is particularly helpful during office hours, but these can be hard to access because there is only one hour per week and it is over Zoom.

The challenging part of this course is the 2 mid-terms (together worth 40% of your grade) and the final (worth 30% of your grade). She is extremely helpful in meeting 1-on-1 and likes students who make an effort to get to know her/meet with her for extra help. In addition, there is a policy memo paper which one has the potential to do well on if they put in the time and effort and follow the student example policy memo. TAKEAWAY: I HAD NO ECON EXPERIENCE, HAD TO PUT IN A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT, AFTER FAILING THE FIRST MIDTERM I ACED THE FINAL. With that said, if you want an econ 1 class with less work maybe take it with a different prof.\"",
            "review 23: \"21F with Melinda Petre: Based on what I heard from my friends who were taking this class with Curtis or DRT Petre definitely gave the most amount of work. She had a flipped classroom model which meant all of the material was taught outside of class. Every week she had a series of lectures accompanied by lecture notes that you had to go through in order to learn the content. Additionally, there were 2 discussion posts that you had to answer and you had to respond to 2 other posts (so 6 posts total). There was also short 3-4 short worksheets spaced throughout the lecture notes to test you on the content covered, but you have unlimited attempts for those and she gives you the answers after. There is also a 30 question quiz every week which only has 2 attempts and is graded on accuracy, but aren't too difficult if you've been paying attention to the lectures. There is also 1 problem set that is graded on completion and can take a long time to do if you actually work through the problem, but the answers can be found online. Due to the flipped classroom there is no need to actually go to class since no new material will be taught and there is no attendance taken. On Monday there is a discussion and a real world example about the concepts being learned that week. On Wednesday there is a review of that weeks lecture and you have a chance to ask questions, but she doesn't explain too much more than she does in the lectures. Fridays, is a little bit of review on some more difficult topics and you spend the rest of class working on the problem set and they are due at the end of class. You can turn in the problem set on Canvas or in person and can leave as soon as you finish the problem set. The only days that you have to actually attend class are midterms which there are 2 of and are fairly difficult and she takes points for very small things like not writing your name twice. There is also one 3 page policy memo which she also grades fairly strictly but is not too difficult to get a decent score on but very few people will get an high score on it. All in all, the class is very organized and will do a good job of teaching you the material, but will require a huge time commitment and feel overwhelming at times especially if you have no previous experience with Econ.\"",

The online format definitely made econ1 easier than it was in person, but I don't think it would be impossible to get an A or an A- as long as you work hard, especially because Petre gives you all of the notes and is really great about answering questions in office hours or over email. Overall, I highly recommend taking it with her.\"",
            "review 26: \"20S with Melinda Petre: I highly recommend Dr. Petre; she is one of the best professors I've had at Dartmouth. By the way, Dr. Petre is likely at least as good as Professor Curtis! As others have said, the mandatory credit / no credit grading and the remote format made this class a bit easier than it otherwise might be. Still, Dr. Petre was so kind and extraordinarily accessible to students. She was very responsive to email and had office hours six days per week, in addition to scheduling office hours twice per week with the undergraduate TA. The format of the class in a remote format worked very well, and I would expect Dr. Petre to be comparably good at teaching inside the classroom. The workload for each week was as follows: We had 4-6 lecture videos to watch each week that were approximately 5 minutes each, but note that it probably takes 30 mins in order to take truly good notes (graphs, etc.) on each video, although she did provide us with lecture notes; a 30 minute, closed-note weekly quiz on Monday from the previous week's material; 4 discussion posts each week in which we responded to an article or economics video; and a weekly problem set, due along with the discussion posts on Friday. The quizzes were cumulatively worth 20 percent; we had three short (one page) papers on articles / podcasts of our choosing worth 10% each; problem sets and digital worksheets on Canvas worth 15% collectively; discussion post participation worth 25% overall; and a three page policy memo at the end of the term worth 10%. There were no midterms or final, although I would expect -- in a return to normal grading -- either exams AND / OR the weekly quizzes, which were actually hard, but fair (B- or B average among students on most of them) being weighted more and the short essays and discussion post participation being weighted less. Econ 1 with Dr. Petre will work well in future terms in an online / hybrid format, just as I am sure that it go well once normal learning returns. Dr. Petre is fantastic and I wholeheartedly recommend taking Econ 1 with her! The median in a normal term with her will probably be a B / B+ but an A- or A is probably very attainable.\"",

We had weekly quizzes in addition to the short (5 min) lectures, discussion boards, worksheets, and problem sets. Office hours were held nearly everyday, though I only went once (because Zoom). Prof Petre was very supportive, and she gave really detailed feedback on problem sets. There was two short papers (1 page) and a final paper (3 pages).

            "review 29: \"20F with Melinda Petre: DISCLAIMER: My econ 1 class was completely asynchronous, so future classes will be very different. I actually enjoyed taking Econ 1 online. The way that Dr. Petre structed the class worked really well online in my opinion. We had a set of lecture videos to watch each week and she posted notes to go along with the videos. Then each week we had a problem set due which took about 2-3 hours to complete except for one week which took 4 hours to complete. In addition to the problem sets we had discussion posts to make on 2 different articles that discussed econ topics. Those were pretty easy. We also had weekly quizzes that would boost your grade if you understood and studied all the concepts from the videos. Over the term we had to write two short essays (one page each) about econ topics and finally a 3 page policy memo due the last day of class. I found that these assignments were pretty easy to complete but were graded harshly (maybe to balance out the easier quizzes). To finish the class we had an online final which was actually pretty difficult, but as long as you studied a good amout was completely doable. Overall I would reccomend taking this class if your interested in econ, just be ready to do a lot of memorization and learn about a bunch of new topics that can at first seem somewhat abstract.\"",
            "review 30: \"20F with Melinda Petre: I took this class online asynchronous, and it was absolutely amazing. Each week there were around 5 short mini-lectures (max 15 minutes each) posted along with written lecture notes, quick worksheets, and a problem set. We also had a weekly open note quiz that was timed for 30 minutes, as well as weekly discussion boards to post on. Dr. Petre was extremely friendly and always willing to help in office hours and review sessions, and seemed to really care about her students. The weekly work was very manageable, and having it all posted at the beginning of the week made managing time very easy. Aside from the weekly work, there was a couple of 1 page essays and one three page paper at the end of the term. The best part: no midterm!

The material is naturally difficult, but her lectures, lecture notes, and crazy frequent office hours made it super manageable. We had weekly Psets and quizzes that were really straight forward. I took the course asynchronously so would definitely recommend starting the material earlier on in the week. Felt like Khan Academy in a good way. 2 essays and a policy memo but Prof Petre would read over my writing assignments which basically ensured that you would get a minimum A- on these assignments. I would definitely recommend Petre and/or Curtiss as the go-to option for Econ01. Petre is so awesome and made me want to take more classes in the major. Nicest lady, responds to emails fast, and has a very \"mom-like\" vibe. Final was super hard and never received a formal grade for it but it didn't affect my end grade at all.\"",

I found the content interesting, but it was just overwhelming sometimes. I took this asynch so obviously a very situation compared to in-person, but I would say that if you take this without any prior Econ experience, make sure you're taking a layup at the same time. Taking Econ 1 with Petre was definitely a lifesaver for me though, because she had office hours every day of the week, and at varying times of the day, so you really could get help when you needed it, instead of waiting a week for OH or for an email response (she was really quick on emails too). Her essay grading was pretty harsh but I would recommend going to OH for guidance from her, and then write your essay as per her recommendations. If you write the way she wants you to, she'll love your essay. The policy memo was also very harshly graded considering we only had three pages to convey a lot of information, but once again, I think if I'd taken my memo into OH, I could have done better. The weekly quizzes are sometimes time-stressed but you get used to it, and the problem sets are similar, sometimes they take 5 hours to do, other times they're only 2 hours or so. You HAVE to stay on top of things every week in this course because otherwise you'll be stuck under an absolute mountain of work, even if you're only a week behind. This was a well-organised course, it just had A LOT of work each week, so make sure you're able and willing to devote many hours each week to this course.\"",

If nothing else, it will teach you about a worthwhile way to think (MC=MB) which can be applied to all aspects of life. Literally, all aspects. -The class isn't easy, but if you do the work, you can do well. There is very little memorization. If you expect to come in and memorize the textbook, like in Biology, and do well, you will be disappointed. I'm not sure if I flat-out memorized anything in the course. It is all about understanding concepts and applying to concepts. -I took it freshman fall, and I thought it was a great course to take. Not too much work, but you can't slack off either. This isn't one of those abstract classes either. I came out of this with useful knowledge. -From what I saw, there are basically two ways to do well in the course. 1) Go to every lecture, follow along the powerpoint slides, take notes, absorb the material from there. 2)Skip classes, read the book. I choose 1, but because the each lecture basically covers one chapter of the book, either one will work. You should pick 1 too though because Carrell is such a good lecturer and intelligent guy that it is well worth your time to go to class. About Carrell: -Though you can learn all the material from the book, I would recommend going to every class because he is a great lecturer. Very well-spoken. -He is extremely intelligent. -I got the impression he wanted to go beyond the more basic overview of some topics because he knew more about it and really liked that particular topic, but because of time constraints had to restrain himself. That's neither a positive or negative really, just an observation. -He has experienced the world (he was in the Air Force for about a decade) so he isn't one of these Ivory tower sheltered professors. -Overall he is possibly the second-best teacher I have ever had. The first was a teacher I had for 3 years in high school in small classes, so it says a lot about Carrell to almost achieve that in a 40-person class for 10 weeks. Take Econ 1, take it with Carrell if he is still around (he is a visiting professor so he might leave, which would be a shame because he is exactly the person Dartmouth needs to keep).\"",

Prof Carrell also gives out very little practice problems in preparation esp for the final exam so that it is very difficult to study for them. Afterall, the practice problems in the textbook aren't the same level of difficulty as the ones on the exams. But on the other hand, Prof Carrell is a great lecturer.

A couple of things to add that other reviews may not have mentioned: I'd ESPECIALLY recommend taking this class as a freshman. Dr. Lee incorporates extra credit assignments into her class aimed at allowing students in the class to get to know each other, and that would be especially useful as a freshman.

If you've never taken microeconomics before, studying only with Shenhav's lectures may be confusing - all she does it read off her powerpoint slides. I'd highly recommend watching the Khan Academy video for the topic being covered FIRST and then watching Shenhav's lecture afterwards. As someone who never took econ before, this helped me tremendously - it's so much easier to understand what Shenhav is talking about AFTER you internalize the core concepts. All her exams are taken directly from the lecture slides so when you are studying, just look over the slides several times until everything is crystal clear in your head. Problem Sets are graded for completion and participation is free points so just make sure you're above the median on midterms/final and you'll end with at least an A-. Shenhav never curves anyone down (unlike some other econ professors) so as long as you do well on the exams, there's not much to worry about. Although this class was fair in difficulty, this class discouraged me from doing econ in the future. Shenhav is a nice person but she just is not a great professor...no enthusiasm for what she's teaching and she's terrible at answering questions (once she didn't know the answer to someones question so she just sat there going \"hmmmmm\" for 2 minutes...and she still hasn't answered the question to this day).

Difficulty: Some students seemed to struggle with the material, but on the whole it was straight memorization, and there was a good number of students who breezed through it. Professor Z even remarked as he was giving back the midterms once that there were \"too many high grades.\" The class had very, very little outside work. My impression is that sometimes the class is curved- this would make it harder to do extremely well, and make it easier to do extremely poorly, so beware the possibility. Material: Economics is a very rich field, but you have to learn a lot of basic, not-so-interesting material before you can take the interesting electives. Therefore, I was disappointed by Econ 1. It could have been called \"Graph Memorization 1.\" The final was pure \"bulimic learning\" which certainly made it easy, but left me feeling like I hadn't learned a lot. Apparently some people are turned on to Econ by Econ 1, but I can't picture it. Perhaps it's another one of those famed 'weeder' classes after all. After Econ 1, you have to take stat (Econ 10) and some combination of Macro, Micro, and Econometrics (each of which I've been told is similar to Econ 1) before you can take any higher level electives you're interested in- finance, international economics, economics of development, environmental economics, game theory, etc. A lot of people take Econ because it's \"practical.\" I advise that you be sure that you want to explore a passion in economics before spending a slot on Econ 1.

I then had to fully explain my situation for him to understand that I was actually sick and unable o get out of bed for two days, at which point his entire tone shifted and he quadrupled the extension. He pretty much told me he thought I had just skipped class for fun and thought I was asking for an extension because I was a bad student with poor time management.

I'm of the opinion that no student should have to detail their issues to a professor for the sake of their grade, and I can\u2019t imagine dealing with the campus mental crisis in this class.

TAs are super helpful, all the content is supposed to be intuitive so if econ doesn\u2019t come to you naturally, I\u2019d recommend skipping this course because he goes through the content really fast. I'd call it a layup, but a lot of people dropped the class after the first midterm so I don't think we all feel the same about the difficulty of the course. I also want to add that I was in the second section, and he'd tell us how he'd struggle to finish the lecture in time to end the first class (which I think is what happened to one of the other reviewers for 21F) and then he'd cut down his explanations for my section and would finish 10 minutes early every single class without fail.\""

On the point of \"tariffs can help us protect our national culture and identity,\" Berthelon (in a most animated way) cried that \"I have no idea what this means!!! This is simply not valid!!! I don't know what this is!!!! This is so bogus, we don't need to discuss this!!\" I have two problems with his behavior here. One, if he doesn't know what it means, he should not be a professor.

He does not give practice material at all for the later midterm and the final, and we have group presentations every other week. The practice MCQs after every week and the psets are super easy, ungraded, and do not really reflect the difficulty of exams.

More than half of class time is spent discussing his personal experiences that have absolutely nothing to do with Econ. He seems more interested in himself than in giving his students a good education. He is unable to explain anything, and you are significantly better off learning from the textbook and just not showing up during class. Although there is a few things in his lecture not covered in the textbook. Honestly, I would just suggest switching professors. Just an extra little thing, most people in Curtis's class complain about the curve. I don't know about Curtis's class, but I've heard that she does a down-curve or something? Well, people told me that Zarnowski set the A grade to 96% so I don't see how that is any better than a down-curve. Workload: The homeworks are clumsily written. Many of the questions are simply unsolvable because he wrote the question wrong or unclearly. Some of the test questions are also clumsily written, sometimes to the point that they become unanswerable. Some test questions are also unfairly tricky and purposely misleading for no apparent reason (the trickiness has nothing to do with your ability to think critically. It seems like he just wants a way to take off points). Furthermore, the time limit forces you to be a little hurried during the test, leading to careless mistakes that are not indicative of your understanding of the material. Furthermore, considering that an A is a 96%, it's basically impossible to get an A since the tests and homeworks are so faulty. Some of the test questions are also not covered in the textbook or lecture, so that the only way to get them right is to already know them from some random knowledge you have beforehand. I am very angry about how unfair this course was, and I feel like it has been a complete waste of my time because the concepts taught were so ridiculously simple. He just does trivial things to make the grades lower. This class has been my worst experience at Dartmouth so far. Do not let this class discourage you from becoming an Econ major though. This class is not an accurate representation of what other Econ classes are like. Some people actually even like this class, so perhaps you might too. I know that I'm in the minority for not liking this class, but I think I have more than enough reasons to justify my disappointment. I feel that students who enjoyed this class only did so because they enjoyed the stories he told. However, class time is not meant for such things. If you're a student who wants a grade that represents your effort and ability, you will probably be very disappointed with this prof.\"",
