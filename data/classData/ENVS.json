Even thought the topics we learn about are very dry and can become very repetitive from the other ENVS classes she makes them fun to learn and is very engaging in the way she teaches. Although I totally recommend taking this class with Dr Chaudhary for the ENVS major / minor it is definitely not a layup. Before the midterm and final there is an assignment where you have to make 5 short response questions and 5 long response questions, these are used for a study guide and sometimes on the exam. The midterm is graded pretty rigidly and without much transparency (having said that it was also online / virtual), and a final with the same format. There is also a group research paper and a couple of in field data collection classes. Its a good class that I totally recommend but its not a lay up if thats what your looking for.\"",

The second half we split between regular lectures and in field research across the road from the O-Farm, breaking into groups to complete a full research paper by the end of the term. Professor Chaudhary was an awesome professor and incredibly knowledgeable about soil ecological systems. One of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth as an ENVS major.\""

Not going to lie, I did more writing, and learned more about writing in this class than I did in my Writing 5 class, because although all the readings are focused on Nature-based solutions, most of the class revolves around readings, writings, essays and discussions -- with basically no lectures. As of this term we also had to do \"design thinking creations\", one of which we presented during a class one of the weeks. The other three also increased with expectation, going from like a flowchart to an open ended actual \"creation\" (think diorama, poster, web-project, etc.), and they all corresponded to the three essays we had in the class.

He's very knowledgeable about envs with a focus on innovative solutions and I definitely learnt a lot from this seminar. That said, though, he's a little bit of a harsh grader and long story short, as much as you put into it is as much as you get out of it. There were bi-weekly reading responses of ~200 words and you're expected to familiarize yourself with it since it's the class discussion topic every class. There are 3 essays total with increasing word limits, and he has high expectations on the quality. If you show your effort and complete them with diligence and critical thinking, it should be fine.

She routinely posted her required info hours before class started. Most classes included a movie, a 50 page reading, and at least one extra lecture. During every class, she wasted 40 minutes reading over the class expectations every. single. class. like we were in 3rd grade. On two occasions asked me to submit work I had already submitted weeks before (she had forgot i sent her the emails!) and threatened to give me zeros on those assignments. At the end of the semester she hosted required class AFTER the last day of classes, completely disrespecting those looking to study for finals. Finally, one day before the deadline for the final project, she gave feedback that she said was required to be in the final. I had to re-tape my final project podcast from scratch a day before it was due during finals. Avoid this class at all costs, and especially avoid Prof Snorek.

Workload is a little on the heavy side; weekly readings + blog entries of around 1000 words that require a bit of thinking/reflection/connection each week, two \"quizzes\" which are pretty much just midterm essays of about 3000 words that require substantial digging into the material, and a final project.

Almost all of class was small group discussion with Prof Fox popping into different groups to check in. I didn't feel like I learned much from her, just from the ridiculous amounts of readings. We read at least two academic papers per class for about the first two thirds of the term, with 1.5 pages single spaced due as a reflection each class for the first ~4 weeks. The first paper was a self reflection which was easy and almost everyone in the class got an A. The second paper didn't really have a prompt and I found it extremely difficult and unclear even after meeting with Prof Fox multiple times about it.

It starts off very manageable, with nightly readings and a short reflective paper. The second paper, an analytical piece only using the articles you've read in class as evidence, is not too bad either, as long as you write exactly what she's looking for. The FINAL PAPER, however, is where this class gets you. In the syllabus, the page counts for the papers are 4, 8, and 15, respectively. You might think \"Oh, 15 pages, that's more than I'm used to but not too bad.\" Ah, you sweet summer child. For THIS PAPER, the 15 pages are 1.5 spaced, size 11 font, formatted like a formal academic paper. When we asked her for an approximate word count, she set the baseline at 6000 words, allowing for 6000-9000 total. If this were your typical Times New Roman size 12 double spaced paper, this would come out to about 24 pages. Keep in mind that the guidelines for all FYS state that the TOTAL word count for the ENTIRE COURSE should typically be about 6000 words. So be warned. If you're looking for a class with minimal writing, proceed with caution. If you don't mind writing a lot, however, I would recommend this class, whether or not you're interested in pursuing ENVS.\""

We learned very little about specifics but focused instead on broad ideas and themes as well as the governmental and market forces that influence global environmental issues. The main theme that we kept returning to was the issue of the state v. the market in all aspects of study. Logistically, each class was begun with a student panel (we each had to sign up for two) that presented the main ideas of the readings to the class and started discussion based on questions they came up with. This was actually really cool, and it meant that you had to do little of the reading yourself when it wasn't your turn to present, although it was much better of course if you did. Professor Dorsey speaks incredibly slowly and theoretically, and it did drive me crazy at times to listen to him all class. He is very supportive and excited about what the students come up with, though, and he has done some cool things (like serve on the board of the Sierra Club for six years). There were a few smaller assignments, including a literature review and a small group paper on an environmental issue. The main part of the class was the final research paper, which was long but incredibly interesting if you picked the right topic. We had plenty of time to pick, revise, and consult about our topics, and he made sure we got started early.

The flip side is that if you get into a good class discussion, Dorsey's not afraid to let it go a bit long and run into other material.

Don't expect to be studying specific int'l subjects like deforestation in equatorial countries. Environmental issues are put in much much broader social and economic contexts, and the course is more about the impacts of globalization and the current exploitative global structure (at all levels, social, economic, environmental) than about carbon trading and mining.

This is a fantastic class for any student interested in science, environmental studies or law itself.\"",

If you are at all interested in environmental law or law school at all, Brooks gives you a great idea of what it's like because he teaches at Vermont Law School during the year. He spends the first few classes scaring people off. You have to do the reading, and actually understand it, because he will call on you at any time to explain something. But after the first week or so you get used to it and the class smooths out. There is a lot of reading, but it's pretty interesting and definitely not a deal breaker. There was also a midterm about a hypothetical case that was not too bad and a final paper on a case that you choose.\"",

Brooks is a great teacher who really knows his law. The discussions in class were great, the readings were surprisingly interesting and readable, and the workload was not ridiculous. The lack of grades was slightly annoying, since you only get the midterm as a way to measure how well you are doing - you have no real clue what your grade will be until you see it. But that's really a minor issue. If you have any interest in environmental law or ecology, and you don't have some phobia about discussing topics in class (because Brooks will call on you), I cannot reccomend this course more strongly.\"",

Be expected to go beyond the reading in your responses. The class is a lot of fun and while it can be initially intimidating, stick it through.

My only problem with the course was that that our grades were based on class participation and a 20 page paper-- meaning that by the end of the term, you will have absolutely no idea of what your standing in the course is.

Typically, we read a significant court case for each class and than discussed it in class. Most of the court cases were from a book written by Brooks - we read the actual text of the cases, but he edited out some material to help us get at the core issues. The cases were interesting to read and provided insight into the American Legal system. We also read from a book about the rise of environmental law in our country. This was authored by Brooks and a few other Dartmouth profs. It was very boring and as we read a pre-publication edition there were a lot of grammer errors. Class was typically about 40% lecture (which drew from the latter book) and 60% discussion. Brooks was good at catalyzing interesting discussion, but the students in the class also helped make things interesting. In addition to class work there's a 10 page research paper based on a court case (each students gets a different one), a final with a hypothetical law scenario, and an ungraded midterm which serves as a practice for the final. Overall, the class was an ideal experience, though if one were to skip out on doing the readings I think they would not get much out of it. The class is good because it is not just a regurgitation of the readings.\""

There was a midterm, a case brief and a final paper. Honestly, I paid close to zero attention and still did well; the lectures are so boring, the material was so boring...the course was worthless.

Prof. Jones has a degree in ecology and is also a lawyer, so his knowledge of the material is substantial. However, this course does have two downsides.First, the class was supposed to be capped at 12 students, but there ended up being 40 -- this totally changed the class dynamic from discussion-based to lecture-based. Second, Prof. Jones is not a great lecturer, which was a problem b/c the class became lecture-based. Fortunately, if this class was kept at a discussion/seminar level, it would be very rewarding. Prof. Jones is very insightful and very receptive to any questions regarding course material -- he even helped me think through my final paper. All in all, this course has a lot of potential, and I would not be discouraged by a few bad reviews (due mainly to the unfortunate change in the structure of the class).\"",

At first, Fox's lectures seem intense because they give you so much background information, but just absorb as much as you can, since you get graded more on the readings and how you can connect concepts. Besides the heavy workload, this class is worthwhile beyond description. The topics are fascinating, and I am now interested in a region of the world I previously knew nothing about. Definitely take this class.\"",

Big mistake. Not only did I find the material far from interesting, but it served as a strong reminder of why I don't do social sciences. Amazing how much people can say about so little. On top of that, the workload was unbelievable. About 2,000 pages of reading throughout the term, a midterm paper, a group research paper and a final paper (all 6-7 pages), in addition to several other minor assignments and quizzes. The research and final papers were both due during finals week. Anyway, maybe my overly negative response only applies because I'm much more a science person than otherwise, but in that case, if you're a science person, DO NOT take this class. Don't try to hit 2 birds with 1 stone. It's just not worth it.\"",

However, Prof Fox is a great teacher and wants her students to do well, so I found that my initial ignorance wasn't a problem. In this class students learn a little bit about the history and especially the colonial legacy left on these countries, and apply it to current and past environmental struggles. I took this class concurrently with Geog 001 (also taught by Prof Fox), and many of the themes coincided. This is a great class for anyone interested in learning about how the global economy, local politics, and various methods of protest shape decisions, policy, and actual events in developing and recently developed countries. This class is not for people who hate to read and write. I found the amount of work reasonable, but be aware that to do well you need to read 15 articles per week, and attend class regularly; Prof Fox likes people who participate and her assingments reflect this.

The assignments for the midterm and final are really specific which takes away much space for creative thinking about the problems. There is group work, which I hate, maybe you do too.

            "review 1: \"23F with D.g. Webster: This course was not at all what I expected, and this was part of why I found it very challenging. We spoke almost exclusively about mining and fishing. The information came from a variety of sources, mostly conversations with government officials in the Ministries, and also some actual local workers (but very few). We also were able to speak with a few representatives from NGOs on a variety of subjects like seal entanglement/plastic pollution and seabird conservation. These lectures were interesting but often very long, and we did not always get representative views on issues - I would have preferred speaking to more Namibians about how they view issues around mining and fishing, as they are the ones actually working in the industries and suffering the potential consequences. Our assignments consisted of 1000 word essays which we had 2-3 days to complete, often on days with full lecture dockets too, and they were all based on Professor Webster's self-created framework; this made them near impossible to write in the Namibian context, and they made us just do lots of external research (which we could just do the same at Dartmouth). Additionally, we had a \"debate\" with students at the University of Namibia which required lots of preparation, even though it became just a more informal discussion. The grading felt extremely harsh - essays, debate preparation, and even participation were graded critically. If you go on the FSP, obviously you can't choose specific courses to not take, but this one was not good. We were overworked and underrested through the whole thing, without learning enough that was different from a class at Dartmouth.\"",
            "review 2: \"23F with D.g. Webster: This class had so much potential but ended up being the hardest part of the FSP academically, mentally, and physically. I did not enjoy it and unfortunately, I think that most people on the FSP shared this opinion. While we got to talk to the Ministries of Fisheries, visited Uranium/Diamond mines that we might have not otherwise gotten to do, the schedule was too jam-packed as our days would often start in the early mornings (on the bus at 7am) with back-to-back lectures and end after dinner with pretty much no breaks outside of the \"meal times\". This was very stressful without days/weekends off (this was true for the entirety of the FSP). I also found that the academic assignments (1,000-3,000 word essays) were quite tough and were not helpful in synthesizing our experiences talking to different stakeholders within fisheries and mining companies as they did not allow for reflection or application from our conversations, but instead, had to be drawn from existing literature online. The papers could have been done in a classroom at Dartmouth just as easily and were not reflective of the unique nature of this FSP. We were also not given enough time to write them, given the intense scheduling and they were graded quite harshly. Our \"break\" days were the only times we had to write the essay, so we weren't really given breaks at all. There was basically no time for personal needs, you couldn't really take your personal space because we had programming all day until the evening and were living in such close quarters to each other with not many other places we could really leave and go to. The excursions presented cool opportunities to learn from experts of different backgrounds and were quite interesting, but overall, I would say that this course should be significantly modified in terms of scheduling and in terms of what assignments are given.\"",
            "review 3: \"23F with D.g. Webster: I liked being by the coast/staying in beds for this course (the middle 3 weeks of the FSP) and found the topics of mining, fishing, climate/energy very interesting. As for grading, ENVS 42 and ENVS 84 both had A medians (the first course ENVS 40 was an A- median). To succeed in ENVS 42 is very doable, just be sure to state the buzzwords (power/profit disconnect, regulatory capture, temporal myopia, etc.) and weave them into your essays. If you had a friend who took ENVS 17 or another course w Webster, maybe ask for their notes bc you need to use those terms and incorporate them into her framework to succeed. Webster is def more receptive to giving helpful feedback than Bolger if you ask her for help and stay engaged in talks. I enjoyed the sites we visited (uranium mine, kayaking trip w/ seals, tours on fishing vessels, talks w government officials) and felt like I learned a lot/had fun from these 3 weeks!\""

We spent three weeks essentially being tourists with minimal lecture and assignments. The first 5 days were in Soweto, Johannesburg which was a more cultural portion of the course and broadened my worldview substantially. We then travelled throughout central Namibia, among different conservancies, game reserves, farms, and parks. We learned about human-wildlife conflict, management strategies, and other associated environmental issues with different conservation strategies. It was interesting to talk with local people, but we ended up spending a lot of time talking with white people rather than Indigenous/Black people - I think the course needs to become better structured to provide a better representation of views on the environmental issues we are talking about. It felt like a very privileged section of the course without a lot of introspection on our position as a wealthy institution visiting communities and thinking about their problems without always accessing their own opinions. Still, we got to see incredible wildlife and scenery that was truly unique and made it really fun.\"",

I would definitely recommend this class, I learned a lot about differing perspectives on topics such as game reserves/hunting and conservation and it was genuinely interesting to hear my views on what was considered \"bad\" or \"unethical\" be framed differently. Professor Bolger is very knowledgeable about conservation in Namibia and was eager to teach us during drives through national parks on the overlander-bus. I think he appreciated anyone who was genuinely engaged and curious throughout the course. While there are early mornings every day of the course (6am starts), the views you get to see (such as animals by the waterholes) are so worth it! Professor Bolger is very understanding and relatively chill. We had 3 assignments overall that were based on 1-2 readings on a framework that we would have to apply to our experiences with organizations/locals. These were \"1-2 pages\" double-spaced and the prompts were relatively broad. My main criticism (that is shared by most of my peers too) was that we were interacting with predominantly white people during this course, which left us quite confused, and at times it felt wrong to not be learning some things from black/indigenous communities. While land ownership structures, working-class structures, and colonial legacies in Namibia definitely influenced this lack of interaction with marginalized communities, I still think that Dartmouth could have done more to address this issue. Other 23F reviews such as: \"This course was a really fun experience...\" capture the course well too!\"",

Unique experience learning about trophy hunting, ecotourism, conservation etc and talking to locals but definitely challenging to camp while doing work. Bolger is a pretty tough grader - doesn't really like providing feedback and in my opinion is stoic/difficult to get to know. Though he doesn't state this in his prompt, he also wants you to come up with a profound ARGUMENT in your 2-page paper and present a whole thesis (even though it's 2 pg double spaced), so don't not take a firm side and reflect on your experience like I did. Instead, really try to state a controversial opinion (he eats those up) and make ur paper spicy (you don't even have to agree w it lol just take a firm stance). Very back-ended course too.. work really ramped up towards the end of the 3-weeks and if you get carsick on buses, it is difficult to be productive.\""

If you aren't very into science/chemistry though, consider a different class. The science concepts aren't very challenging though, and there are weekly computer assignments on either Stella or Excel. There's only one midterm and one final, and homework counts for most of your grade.\"",
            "review 2: \"05S with John E.: The course consists of three main parts. Part 1 discusses the physical processes behind how the planet's atmosphere and oceans circulate. Part 2 deals with the global energy balance and the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients through the atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere. Part 3 talks about global warming and the changes humans have made on this planet. Though the ORC says the course doesn't have a lab, we use every single x-hour for weekly problem sets. Four of the problem sets utilize a modeling program called Stella, and two use Excel. They're useful and help you to understand the material presented in class. The final problem set is quite time-consuming, so don't procrastinate! I found this class very interesting and very worth taking. There's enough hard science to make it challenging, but it doesn't compare to a biology or chem course. And, of course, Barret is a great prof. He is really enthusiastic about what he teaches and loves to interact with the class. Every lecture is accompanied by a powerpoint presentation which he posts on blackboard. There is one midterm exam and one final exam. You don't really have to do the reading because his tests are only on what he covers in lecture, but it's worth doing anyway because it's interesting and does help you to understand the material.\"",
            "review 3: \"05S with John E.: The course goes over all of the aspects and arguments for and against global climate change and allows students to be informed on these issues. Very definitely a science course, but the science is taught in a way that made it accessible even to a humanities major like myself. Jeb is a very good professor and class was very interesting and informative. Labs are minimal work and are really more like homework than a lab. Good course, good prof whether for a major, someone who is interested or a SCI distrib.\"",

Prof. Barrett, while quite kind and helpful, just was not engaging with his lectures at all. I had a really hard time paying enough attention in class to get anything out of them. I definitely would NOT recommend this class to a non-major, and if you need 20, 25, or 30 for the major, I'd try to fit in 25 or 20.\"",

It was much more scientific than I expected--while the class focused mostly on global warming, we discussed very few of the social or economic implications. The homework assignments with STELLA involved modeling different systems and were very interesting. The exams were harder than I expected and very difficult to study for given the huge amount of material covered in the textbook.\"",
            "review 8: \"03S with John E.: Prof. Barrett's lectures were succinct and very thorough. All lecture outlines were available on Public but were no substitute for attending class. Readings were slow but important to understanding lectures. Biweekly assignments using modeling software were really interesting, but not something that could be done the night before (I tried). This was among the best classes I have taken at Dartmouth. I did poorly because I procrastinated (no late assignments accepted) and got behind on the readings. But I would take it again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend it to anybody who thinks they're up to the challenge...or who doesn't mind riding the D-train in pursuit of a great class.\""

            "review 1: \"17F with David Lutz: ENVS 30 was relatively easy. We had a 2 midterms and a final as well as 4 assignments, specifically two problem sets, a group presentation, and a research paper. The final wasn\u2019t really a final, as it was worth less than each midterm. The midterms and final were fill in the blank and free response - the more terms you memorized from your notes and lecture slides the better you did. I spent 3-4 hours memorizing my class notes for each exam and did quite well on them. The assignments took about 6 hours each for me - although my friend claimed to have done them in half the time, while only scoring a few points lower. The material was ok. The class acts as an intro to environmental science - covering basic biology, ecosystems, and environmental issues. It gets more interesting when specific environmental impacts are examined at the end of the course; the last two assignments required us to look into journal articles. The reading, although it seemed required, was not required to do well in the class. I did none of it and believe I\u2019ll get an A. Overall, I would not recommend the course because the course involved too little thinking and too much memorization. Unless you an ENVS major, you will likely forget most of what you learned. Professor Lutz was very nice and down to earth - he admitted one class that he didn\u2019t get into Dartmouth. He did a good job making classes interactive by asking questions.\""

He is such a nice and sweet old man who genuinely is so passionate about toxicology (he has a PhD). I remember the first class he said he used to teach at Geisel but now likes teaching undergraduates more because our minds are \"malleable,\" whereas the Grad Students aren't. Interpret that as you will. In terms of courseload and difficulty level, it is very easy. The readings get longer and longer, and while you may be tempted to not do them (he lectures on them anyways during every class), I would highly recommend doing them because if you skip readings, they will come back to haunt you at the midterm, which was way harder than expected (as in you need to be able to cite most readings).

            "review 9: \"08S with Bill Roebuck: I originally signed up for this course only because it fit the requirements for my major and I needed another class. I didn't expect to get into it at all, because I didn't know the first thing about public health and I'm definitely not premed. You can chalk up my change of mind to the prof being an engaging lecturer and the specific case studies including two areas that I'd been interested in on my own. So, there's a briefing paper and a term paper (which are almost the same except that the term paper is worth more), two quizzes, and a final. Oh, and class participation is also a part of the grade; I always felt that that was ridiculous given that the class was so large, but there's nothing you can do about that so I highly recommend frequently posting news items, etc., to the forum on Blackboard. The tests are not that hard (though they do require that you be familiar with at least some of the Blackboard postings and EXTREMELY familiar with the readings) and they tend to be VERY similar to past years' tests (to the point of having the exact same questions sometimes) that we got to study with. What I found problematic was that the quizzes were crammed into x-hours when they weren't really doable in just an hour. I always had to rush through them and it just wasn't a great experience. The final, because we had three hours for it but not THAT much more to answer than the quizzes, was great. As for the two papers, they weren't bad, though I felt that the prof didn't emphasize enough that he wanted detail and specificity. Just a heads-up, the prof doesn't normally post his lecture slides, but somebody must have presented a convincing argument because he did so this time. Don't count on it in the future. The prof was great, especially about meeting with people, but he did lecture a bit slowly so we were always falling behind schedule and he couldn't always remember where he'd left off on a set of slides so we got some repetition. The powerpoints weren't THAT thorough, though, so I definitely wouldn't recommend skipping class, especially if you've posted something since the last class because the prof likes to call on those people at the beginning of class to spend a few minutes discussing their postings.\"",

Professor Ong had a pretty good structure that was the same each week. So we only had class wednesdays, thursdays and fridays. Wednesdays and Fridays were mainly lectures or coding days (since for each lab you have to code in R) and then thursdays were full lab days at the farm, so from 9am-1pm we were doing lab work/ field work on the farm. You have four field projects and then one final independent project at the end of the term. Each field project is done with a lab group that is randomly chosen at the beginning of the term, so whether you have a good or bad experience in the class is based on luck tbh. Each person in the group is supposed to have a role and do their own work, so I would say that the workload isn't too bad - if everyone does their part. The TAs are also very helpful and each TA leads a lab group, so they are mainly the ones that are grading and doing the field project with you and your group. The field projects were honestly pretty fun and I felt that I learned a lot about sampling methods, data collection and visualization with each one. We also presented all of our findings each Wednesday so we got to learn about the field projects that each group was doing. At the end of the term you present your independent project to the class and profesor ong bought us Lou's and some fruit and it was so cute.

He even brought a professor from BU and another from the University of Tokyo here to give a guest lecture, a big effort considering it's just a 26 student class.

The $80 reader was full of mostly primary lit, which could be a slog at times, but we discussed the parts that we needed to know for class, in class (in fact, the prof used class participation to make sure people did the readings in the first place, and would call on people to answer questions). The single midterm and the non-cumulative final and the homework were each worth 20%, while the final project, a population viability analysis, was worth 30%. The homework assignments--there were three of them--were based around modeling ecosystems and populations and things. One used EcoBeaker (which was a hassle because it would only run on Mac OS 9) and the last two used Stella. The PVA project also depended a lot on Stella. (Personally, I got really tired of modeling by the time the class ended.) The PVA had you working in either pairs or individually to create a model of a particular population/metapopulation of a species of your choice, and then everybody wrote up on their own a report about the status of their population and its prospects for continued persistence and management recommendations. I don't think this project was particularly well explained; I kind of muddled through and am STILL not quite sure what exactly was expected of us. The exams were fine, at least in my opinion (know your definitions and examples), but it definitely didn't help that the TA, who was in charge of the review sessions, was incompetent and made people more confused instead of less. Also, I disagreed with the fact that the long essay questions, instead of being scored against some objective rubric, were instead compared to the best answers received. On the other hand, the prof was pretty good about writing exams that could be done in the time allotted, and gave the last few people a few extra minutes to wrap up. The prof was really helpful--he basically made himself available for consultation almost every day after the PVA projects were assigned, as well as having printed out outlines and powerpoint slides for us for every lecture--but he tended to keep falling behind the syllabus. The guest lecture was kind of fun, but not the last-minute notice that we were expected to attend during a time that was not during lecture. The field trip to the forest near the organic farm also felt kind of useless; I didn't feel that we'd covered anything by going there that we couldn't have in the classroom.\"",

According to the ORC, it dealt with a lot of areas of biodiversity that I was interested in. In general, I would say that the readings were pretty good, and I found them on the whole to be enjoyable. The tests were nitpicky at times, and I found the final to be verging on ridiculous. This mostly because on top of the final, we had a joint 4 page paper based on a population model we had to create. In addition to that paper, we had to write an individual paper, which was like 7 pages in length. This on top of a hard final was REALLY annoying. Also, it really galled me that this course turned out to be exactly like Bio 14, only a little easier. It was a lot of been-there, done-that, that I didn't find immediately relevant to the subject. Bolger took the class in that direction because that's his specialty, but in the end, I feel like it strayed from the ORC description. The teaching itself was terrible. Bolger came to class with some notes for himself and a basic handout and just prattled away. It was as if he made no effort to come up with any kind of multimedia or engaging material. This would be fine if he himself was engaging, but it was all I could do to not fall asleep. He was really awkward in trying to get the class to participate, and he frequently made errors in drawing his graphs or making simple math calculations. Towards the end of the course, I just started skipping classes because I couldn't believe that I was paying money for teaching of this caliber, or lack thereof, and it just depressed me. This could have been a great class but was ruined by Bolger. I would not recommend wasting your time taking any of the classes that he teaches if you can help it. The TA was also a disaster. She TA-ed for another class of mine and was unavailable and extremely picky about adhering to rules to the point where I wanted to tear my hair out. Apparently, the year before this Bolger was not the prof, and it was someone else who was more laid-back and gave less work.

There is now a midterm and a final, each consisting of 30-40 closed-ended questions where you are counted off for anything other than a word-for-word regurgitation of what Webster drones on about in lecture. This fits in with the overall theme of the course, which I found to be a pretty draining continual buzzword stew without much--if any--critical thinking involved. The workload for the class is still not super high (5 or so hours per week), but again, the grading of the assignments (especially the weekly community essays) feels like playing jargon whack-a-mole, trying to figure out which exact buzzwords Webster is looking for (in hindsight, I should have just used chatgpt). The lectures are boring but you have to take notes if you want to study for the tests, and Webster occasionally makes a god-awful joke attempt followed by 5-10 seconds of silence or, worse, explaining the joke. Contrary to a prior review, she is not funny. She also cut off students on multiple occasions after calling on them. Ugh. This class was a huge drag on my term. Don't take it unless you really care about marine policy and are willing to wade through seas of buzzwords, jargon, and shitty jokes.\"",

This class has changed tremendously from previous years. The lectures were incredibly boring and contained almost no important substance. As another 24W reviewer notes, D.G. only cares about buzzwords and niche jargon words when grading. She also grades erratically and clearly grades with bias against certain students. Many of the assigned readings were 25+ years old. One reading assignment was from 1991 and the policy mentioned in the article was completely irrelevant; I mentioned this in the annotations and suggested she give us more updated readings (she grades the readings based on annotations on Perusall) and she gave me a 1/5 on the assignment. This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. Do NOT take this class with D.G. she is simply an awful professor. I learned nothing from this class. She was so awful and incompetent she earned the nickname 'Professor Brick' which many students referred to her as throughout the term. In addition, while there is not much work, this class is not really a layup anymore because of her erratic and partial grading and the novel inclusion of a midterm and final exam which has not appeared in this class since before COVID. Really a waste of my time. If you value your time or academic experience do not take this class, even if you are an ENVS major/minor like myself, trust me don't take this class.\"",

Otherwise, I wouldn't want to go through the trials and tribulations of D.G Webster. The structure of this class has also changed a bit since the past reviewers so here it is: ~25% of the grade is based on 3 point, daily annotated readings on Perusall that, if you read and make comments with questions and buzzwords that she uses in class, you get full marks. I do agree that many of these readings were outdated, but some days we also had supplemental videos/documentaries to watch that I found cool. ~30% of the class is based on a weekly 500 word essay (that was graded so randomly) based on a community that is affected by the overarching problem that you studying that week. Webster does give you freebies on a few of these assignments, but only if you tell her in advance. The rest of the class was based on exams and the final project. The exams were extremely annoying, but relatively easy to do well on if your 1 page cheat sheet has all of her lecture notes on it. She did ask random questions from the hundreds of pages of textbook that she wanted us to read that nobody ever read (ie. name 3 species of lobster??), which wasn't fun. Overall, I had many ups and downs with this class, D.G can be a boring lecturer but she does spice it up with a crazy comment every once in a while. The median was also an A-, which changed definitely due to the exams. If you are an ENVS major and want to learn more about the ocean and what it affects, this is a good choice!

Readings with comments twice per week and textbook readings twice per week. The online readings you can do in like 15 minutes and since there are no tests and the papers are about something you choose, they are easy to bs for a good grade in a pinch (and the grading is mostly via automatic system so as long as you check off their list of a few comments and a few replies you're set). The papers are 500 words each week about the topic of that week (ex. ocean mining) and USE KEY TERMS. Take notes of the vocab she uses in class and use it in your essay otherwise you will not get the grade. Also, you are allowed to skip 5 of the 10 discussion posts and do bullet points instead of essays for 3 of the 10. The final is easy it is a presentation and she grades surprisingly hard for it considering how easy everything else is but by hard I mean still pretty nice.

I agree with a few comments saying one of the keys to doing well in this class is throwing in all the keywords. But overall, this is a very good class!\"",

Use all of the terms and 'buzzwords' that she drops and you will do well. Not a layup in the sense of it being 0 work, but if you do the work, you will get an A. Honestly, didn't find it super interesting because the lectures are very surface level and kind of her teaching you how to say things in her way, not critically thinking about things.

Prof. Webster is very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does, and the curriculum felt very relevant. At first, the workload seemed like a lot, but we basically had the same assignments every week, so it was not difficult at all once you understood the pattern and how she grades. Very manageable workload. Not hard to get an A if you turn assignments in on time. She is very understanding and gives you 3 skips on the perusall assignments (I think 3 skips in the first half and 3 in the second half, so 6 total) and one weekly essay that you get to turn in as bullet points. Biggest tip is to remember to key words and vocabulary she presents in class and use those in perusall assignments and essays. The final was a 10-15 min group presentation where you synthesize all of the topics we went over in class for a particular ecosystem, which she gives you plenty of time to work on. Super interesting and definitely a layup.\"",

Each week there are two Perusall discussion posts/ collaborative annotations with associated textbook reading or videos, and a short essay connecting the week's topic to a community in the world. There is also a weekly video/movie which is discussed on Fridays. I personally liked the predictability each week so I could plan my schedule and working time. If you are able to plan accordingly and figure out the methods to get good grades, I thought it was a very manageable workload. Professor Webster is also incredible; she loves answering any questions and is very responsive to questions outside of class as well.

            "review 13: \"21F with D.g. Webster: Overall I think this class is what you make it. Professor Webster is definitely super knowledgable about the field of marine policy and if you are someone who is at all interested in issues facing oceans this is the class for you. It is much more focused on the \"marine\" component than the \"policy\" component. The structure of the class is also very manageable and straightforward. You have an in-class lecture and then two nights a week you have a Perusall reading where you are expected to make a number of significant contributions. There is often reading/a video accompanying the Perusall but you can get away with not doing that part if you try hard enough with making your comments sound sophisticated. Every Friday you have a short essay due. The topic changes every week and the class doesn't dwell on any topic for too long which is nice. The lectures in class require about fifty percent paying attention and you aren't expected to participate, there were a number of people in class that definitely steered the conversation and everyone else kind of just sat back but she's open to different people's comments. I don't think she learned everyones name by the end of the term but what do you expect. There are no formal assessments so your grade is based off of your essays and Perusall contributions, therefore grade-wise you get what you put into it. I would consider this class a layup but it wasn't super interesting to me -- it's one of those classes you find yourself tuning out of knowing full well you'll still be able to do just fine on the assessments.\"",

The workload felt like a lot at the beginning of the course, but as I learned what was really necessary and what wasn't, it became a lot lighter. The textbook readings are essentially never brought up, and while you're supposed to reference them in your discussion posts, most people never did and were never penalized for it as long as they referenced concepts from class. She also allows for a LOT of freebies on homework assignments, which saved me during midterms. The workload is the same every week, although the length of the reading varies dramatically, it generally tends to be pretty manageable, and the predictability was really nice. It's pretty easy to get good grades on the assignments if you use the keywords from class, so if you're intentional and smart about it, you could probably get away with not much work and still get an A. I personally found the material super interesting as it aligns very closely with my interests/passions, so I was super engaged with the class and material and really enjoyed it, but if you're not interested in the ocean/climate change/the environment, you'd probably find this class pretty boring.\"",

There's a rubric for most assignments, so make sure to check all the boxes. The class could also take you as much as 12 or more hours a week, depending on how quickly you read, process, and write. The content is interesting and the class is engaging, with both lectures and discussions. It covers environmental science, policy, and also has a focus on environmental justice. I will say the format of the class and assignments is the same every week until the final research project, so it starts to feel repetitive or monotonous around week 5.\"",

Several guest speakers were brought in during the course of the term and we got to go on a field trip to the New England Aquarium in Boston.

        "D.G. Webster": [
            "review 1: \"24W with D.g. Webster: Terrible class. If Webster is tenured, I'm not sure how. I took it in the first place from a friend's recommendation as a layup and the prior reviews made it seem interesting, but the class seems to have changed a lot in structure since the bulk of the positive reviews. There is now a midterm and a final, each consisting of 30-40 closed-ended questions where you are counted off for anything other than a word-for-word regurgitation of what Webster drones on about in lecture. This fits in with the overall theme of the course, which I found to be a pretty draining continual buzzword stew without much--if any--critical thinking involved. The workload for the class is still not super high (5 or so hours per week), but again, the grading of the assignments (especially the weekly community essays) feels like playing jargon whack-a-mole, trying to figure out which exact buzzwords Webster is looking for (in hindsight, I should have just used chatgpt). The lectures are boring but you have to take notes if you want to study for the tests, and Webster occasionally makes a god-awful joke attempt followed by 5-10 seconds of silence or, worse, explaining the joke. Contrary to a prior review, she is not funny. She also cut off students on multiple occasions after calling on them. Ugh. This class was a huge drag on my term. Don't take it unless you really care about marine policy and are willing to wade through seas of buzzwords, jargon, and shitty jokes.\"",
            "review 2: \"24W with D.g. Webster: A horrible horrible class. D.G. is an awful professor and this class was a complete waste of time. This class has changed tremendously from previous years. The lectures were incredibly boring and contained almost no important substance. As another 24W reviewer notes, D.G. only cares about buzzwords and niche jargon words when grading. She also grades erratically and clearly grades with bias against certain students. Many of the assigned readings were 25+ years old. One reading assignment was from 1991 and the policy mentioned in the article was completely irrelevant; I mentioned this in the annotations and suggested she give us more updated readings (she grades the readings based on annotations on Perusall) and she gave me a 1/5 on the assignment. This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. Do NOT take this class with D.G. she is simply an awful professor. I learned nothing from this class. She was so awful and incompetent she earned the nickname 'Professor Brick' which many students referred to her as throughout the term. In addition, while there is not much work, this class is not really a layup anymore because of her erratic and partial grading and the novel inclusion of a midterm and final exam which has not appeared in this class since before COVID. Really a waste of my time. If you value your time or academic experience do not take this class, even if you are an ENVS major/minor like myself, trust me don't take this class.\"",
            "review 3: \"24W with D.g. Webster: I'm really conflicted about this class. I agree with many of the sentiments of the other reviewers for this term, but, if you are truly interested in the content of the course as I was, it's pretty fascinating and I felt like I learned something. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to go through the trials and tribulations of D.G Webster. The structure of this class has also changed a bit since the past reviewers so here it is: ~25% of the grade is based on 3 point, daily annotated readings on Perusall that, if you read and make comments with questions and buzzwords that she uses in class, you get full marks. I do agree that many of these readings were outdated, but some days we also had supplemental videos/documentaries to watch that I found cool. ~30% of the class is based on a weekly 500 word essay (that was graded so randomly) based on a community that is affected by the overarching problem that you studying that week. Webster does give you freebies on a few of these assignments, but only if you tell her in advance. The rest of the class was based on exams and the final project. The exams were extremely annoying, but relatively easy to do well on if your 1 page cheat sheet has all of her lecture notes on it. She did ask random questions from the hundreds of pages of textbook that she wanted us to read that nobody ever read (ie. name 3 species of lobster??), which wasn't fun. Overall, I had many ups and downs with this class, D.G can be a boring lecturer but she does spice it up with a crazy comment every once in a while. The median was also an A-, which changed definitely due to the exams. If you are an ENVS major and want to learn more about the ocean and what it affects, this is a good choice! But, there are probably better courses to take for the major with less busy work and strange policies.\"",

It was pretty easy to stay engaged in class, but at times there was lots of info being thrown at you at once and it was hard to keep all the vocab terms readily recallable. By the end of the term, the work started feeling repetitive with the 2 weekly policy readings, weekly video, and weekly essay, but Webster gives a lot of \"freebies\" on those assignments. There weren't any exams outside of one final project, which looked easy at first but trying to condense the entire term into 15 minutes was more difficult than expected since Webster expected a super high level of detail. Overall, I would recommend this class!\"",

The content is pretty interesting it is about different human and ocean interactions like mining, communities, fishing, coral reefs, etc. Lectures can get boring at times but she speaks in an engaging way, for the most part, and she is funny. The textbook is honestly super cool I didn't read a lot from it but I wish I did because it is like a giant picture book. The layout of each week is super consistent. Readings with comments twice per week and textbook readings twice per week. The online readings you can do in like 15 minutes and since there are no tests and the papers are about something you choose, they are easy to bs for a good grade in a pinch (and the grading is mostly via automatic system so as long as you check off their list of a few comments and a few replies you're set). The papers are 500 words each week about the topic of that week (ex. ocean mining) and USE KEY TERMS. Take notes of the vocab she uses in class and use it in your essay otherwise you will not get the grade. Also, you are allowed to skip 5 of the 10 discussion posts and do bullet points instead of essays for 3 of the 10. The final is easy it is a presentation and she grades surprisingly hard for it considering how easy everything else is but by hard I mean still pretty nice. She does a good job at making the concepts actually sink into your brain too. The class was about 30% first years and the rest was a mix (lots of seniors too).

The project was a great way to learn about green business, although the project's extremely heavy grade weight was nerve-racking at times. Professor Webster did not give students the impression that they should make use of her office hours. On the rare occasions Professor Webster allowed us to glimpse some modicum of her humanness, she seemed like a person I might want to get to know, but otherwise her lecture style was distant and harsh, and she was condescending and unkind when talking with students. Her blitzes take terseness to a whole new level. By the second half of term, a feeling of general animosity had pervaded the classroom. I didn't come to Dartmouth to feel like students and professors are enemies on different sides of some sort of battle. On the bright side, widespread dissatisfaction with Professor Webster allowed for some serious bonding among students, as did the group project component. I emerged from the class with a lot of new friends There was a lot of reading. None of it was difficult, especially since it became so repetitive that eventually I read only the titles of chapters. This was the first class where I hadn't read every single assigned word, but I found that I was getting so little out of the readings that they were not worth my time.\""

It was more interdisciplinary than I expected as well, combining the science of ice sheets, permafrost and climate change, indigenous Arctic cultures and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and polar exploration history and current geopolitics into a single class. Absolutely take this class if you can get in, although Professor Virginia sometimes gives out additional spots if you write him an email explaining why you want to take the course (I speak from experience). He's also a massive deadhead and will spend the first 5 minutes of every class talking about one of their songs or a Grateful Dead concert he attended back in the 70s. Very quirky but a lot of fun, and listening to the Grateful Dead was a good way to start my morning as I walked into class. My only regret is that I didn't take this class sooner. I recommend taking it as early as you can in your time at Dartmouth. I took it as a graduating senior, but I was so impressed by all the Arctic and Antarctic expeditions Professor Virginia leads that I was jealous I didn't get to experience them.

In the first few weeks of the class, you are introduced to the energy world which is quite informative and serves as a great basic understanding of the energy systems and power brokers. You will have the privilege to speak to many individuals who actively work on energy legislation within the US and influence energy policy on a global scale. There are many useful opportunities for questions that the course offers from these active players. However, be prepared to do an insane amount of work for this course that seems as if there is no reason behind it. You will have to do an ungodly amount of readings that are never talked about in class but you will have to annotate them on a software that makes the annotation process much longer and on top of that you are required to construct 2-3 questions about the readings that to get full credit on must be 200-300 to contextualize the reading before posing the question. Make sure to incorporate all the readings because if you only mention 3/4 of 30+ page readings then you are going to get a 2/3. As for the classes themselves, she will largely never get into anything technical about the energy space instead only speaking broadly about what is occurring. Instead of her teaching the content from the readings for the first few weeks you are going to be split up into small groups and asked to summarize sections of the readings a teach the class.

I am an ENVS/GEOG major looking to go into the energy sector, so this class seemed perfect. I read some of the reviews of this course with Professor Wilson and figured it couldn't be that bad. HA! I don't even know where to start. First off, she was insanely fake. She came off super nice and understanding, but when it came to grading and flexibility she was absolutely ruthless. For instance, most of my discussion questions were graded as a 2/3 with no comment, so I did not even realize until late in the term after talking to other students what she expected for full credit. These discussion questions were based on the sometimes 500+ pages of weekly readings we had, which felt extremely overkill. It was super frustrating having to read, annotate, and ask questions for so much reading because it incentivizes students to cut corners to get it done rather than actually doing the reading and understanding the materials. I was also extremely disappointed that Professor Wilson was so insensitive and lacked empathy towards students dealing with extenuating circumstances. I was dealing with a title IX case, so the title IX office reached out to all of my professors explaining that I was dealing with an emotionally overwhelming process and that they should be empathetic and flexible with deadlines if needed. Her response to the email, sent to myself and the title IX coordinator was: \"How is this supposed to work with group projects?\" As if that was not bad enough, another one of her students got back surgery and was in the hospital and was denied all extensions. This student was in the hospital for over a week and was on oxycontin, and she was told to make up four group labs by herself in that state after explaining her situation. She is incredibly insensitive and I do not even think she realizes. She should not be allowed to work with young adults. Although she was extremely against extensions, she had no problem at all moving due dates and deadlines FORWARD. The absolute worst part of this class (I know, you'd hope I would have already gotten to the worst part) was how she spoke in the classroom without even realizing how insensitive she was being. For instance, she mentioned several times wishing she had more \"African soccer players\" in her classes, and she compared our smart board glitch and lights flickering for a moment to the 6 day power outage that our guest speaker from South Africa described... everyone was speechless and making horrified faces at eachother. I still think about that all the time, it really was THAT bad. Anyways, after all of that, you'd hope I'd know all about energy and the energy system in the US. HA, again! As another reviewer said, Professor Wilson she will largely never get into anything technical about the energy space instead only speaking broadly about what is occurring. Instead of her teaching the content from the readings for the first few weeks you are going to be split up into small groups and asked to summarize sections of the readings a teach the class. Wow.

At some points in the semester, we had around 100-200 pages of reading between Tuesday and Thursday (a similar amount expected for the weekend) and were graded on how well we annotated them. Each week you must also write out 4-6 detailed questions (half a page each) to make sure you are engaging with the material.

Although, if you manage to engage yourself in the course, it is clearly noticed by the prof. and you will end up with a good grade. Prof. Wilson is demanding but fair, and has a lot of knowledge about the course content. I would 100% recommend this class, as this is something that can definitely be great knowledge to have when entering a professional career.\"",

My main takeaway is I would only recommend this class if you need your TAS distrib or if you are extremely passionate about the topic. In my opinion, Prof. Wilson expects too much from her students. The content of the class is quite valuable, but the setup/workload of the class really ruined it for me. Here are a few issues I noticed about this class that you should be aware of before you decide if you want to take it: 1) The psets were so dense, unclearly written, and hard to understand that I would break down into tears at times while doing them. They are graded generously (never got below an A on them) but they require a lot of hard work to complete. 2) Prof. Wilson has this bad habit of stacking all the big deadlines of the class on top of each other so that you would have a pset, several readings, and a project deadline all due on the same day which made the workload more unmanageable than it should\u2019ve been. Again, you will survive and get a decent grade, but it will be very painful for a couple of days throughout the term. 3) Prof. Wilson would get angry and passive-aggressive towards students at times in class, which was uncomfortable for everyone. This didn\u2019t affect my grade but it just pissed me off. For example, she would get very upset if people had their cameras off during Zoom classes and she would pick on them with difficult questions to make them prove that they were paying attention. Like come on, we are in a pandemic, don\u2019t be a jerk. Anyway, I don\u2019t really regret taking this class but it did stress me out a lot at times. Just prepare yourself and go in with caution.\"",

BUT, 20W was Prof Wilson's first time teaching at Dartmouth and it showed. The readings were ridiculously long and boring, but you are hardly assessed on the readings except for 3 problem sets which you can still do without the readings, so there is no real motivation to learn the content. Also, you have to submit questions on the readings a full day before each class, but I don't think my questions were ever answered in class. After the first two weeks, every class period is a different guest lecturer speaking. Some of the guest lectures were incredible and introduced me to great people, but others were too drawn out and off topic. The final project is worth 40% of your grade and there was next to no guidance provided on the project ahead of time. Once you ask the prof enough questions, it turns out to be a pretty standard video & presentation project, but be prepared to spend a lot of time in JMC during week 9.\"",

But, as said before, Professor Wilson was unorganized and expected an absurd amount of work done by her students. We were expected to do ridiculous amounts of dense readings for each class (which no one was physically able to do) and then were assessed on them through problem sets that never made sense and seemed to be put together last minute. We were then given a final project with little to no guidance, and Professor Wilson rarely showed up to her own office hours when we had questions. Again, this class had great potential but ended up being overly stressful for no reason.\""

It was hard to get interested in the first half of the course, which focused in minute detail on every aspect of modeling future population growth, and the course grade would have been much lower if this had been all we did.

During class discussions, which take up most of the class periods, Bolger talks a little too much and directs the discussion towards meaningful topics too little. Also, the \"consumption and sustainability\" topics were, in my opinion, incorporated into discussions far later than they should have been -- population was the sole focus for a solid five weeks. Regardless, this is definitely the freshman seminar to take if you are interested in sustainability or the environment, and can be a good base to use to get more involved in the sustainability-focused activities at Dartmouth.

He said on the first day of class that lecturing is the least effective pedagogical method, yet he proceeded to lecture us the entire term, despite the fact that this was a seminar. He would stay focused for twenty minutes or so and would then seem to go off on tangents. By the end of the term, the course became so frustrating that I would literally walk out of the classroom with headaches. He gives us outdated readings, one of which was so poorly written that it was barely intelligible. He also forces us to read a great nukmber of his articles and view many of his films. The assignments were vague, poorly conceived, and seemed to serve only to further his own research interests. He doesn't give us any feedback on our asignments, so it is hard to know if we are doing well in the class. Finally, though this is certainly not the most important thing, I got a lower grade than I felt that I deserved. I was very displeased with this course, to say the least.

The structure is four 750-word (3-4 page) papers, and a final paper (NOT a research paper--you don't have to use sources outside of what we cover in class, but most people did use a few) which is 2500 words (8-10 pages). The reading can add up, but even Shepherd said that some of it is repetitive and it is not important to read every word, just get the general idea of each. Also, every Thursday a different group of 2 students were responsible for leading a discussion for the second half of class. You really can just leave the talking up to the class if you pick a good discussion topic. Shepherd is a pretty easy grader, and class participation counts for 25% of your grade.\"",

He's interesting and easy to talk to. If you're good at writing to the point (i.e. keeping things short and terse), you'll get a great grade.

This course succeeded on the first purpose, but failed miserably on the second: papers were barely mentioned in class, and were returned with few comments (sometimes almost a month later). In addition, bizarre opinions were sometimes presented, and key \"facts\" inconclusively proved.

(3) Powerpoints, lecture notes, readings, EVERYTHING is posted on blackboard, and its no surprise that there isn't any incentive to go to class. We were lucky to have 50% in attendance. (4) We had guest lecturers come in almost every day for the last month of class. While this could have been really interesting, most of the speeches did not really pertain to the topics of the class. Even if they did, the guests would always be so shocked when we knew NOTHING about the topics. I can't tell you how many times I heard a variation of the remark \"My, what a quiet group!\" to which Sneddon or Dorsey rebutted with some bull about how we \"haven't really covered that\" yet. ummmm right. (5) Frequent listings of wrong readings in syllabus contributed to many hours of boredom that I really didn't want - or need - to endure. (6) Frequest postings of readings in blackboard on the morning that we were discussing it. (7) Recaps of previous day's lesson that took as much as 35 minutes to get though. (8) Two professors that like to list off all of the big environmental commissions and conferences that they attended in their glory days. Awesome, I really don't care. Okay.

The guest lectures were cool, but it would have been nice if everybody and their dog (including the profs for this course) were not making it really apparent that they were fishing for students for their higher-level classes. On the plus side, the profs were really good about putting any and all powerpoints online, and they were really helpful when approached with questions (though they often had to be reminded to post the readings we were supposed to do for the next class). It was also cool how they would offer input on each other's topics during class and have a little back-and-forth on some things, as well as soliciting comments from the class. Unfortunately, Prof. Dorsey lectured really slow and we kept falling behind on the syllabus and having to finish a lecture the class afterwards, and I think he rather overdid it on the chastising-us-students-for-letting-ourselves-get-stuck-in-the-Dartmouth-bubble-and-not-knowing-or-caring-about-what's-going-on-in-the-rest-of-the-world thing. There's two issue briefs and two tests. For the tests, there either wasn't a study guide, or it was useless, but I thought the tests themselves were not too difficult. You just had to know the readings really well, down to the point of being able to spit out keywords and fine distinctions. That said, for the short-answer questions, I was able to BS with my own ideas to some extent when I couldn't remember all the parts of a list of whatever we'd covered in lecture. (People who have good memories will do well in this class.) As for the issue briefs, I didn't feel that the grading was too consistent. It's more like you did well if the prof liked you or your writing style. Almost everybody did really well on those, though I suppose that it's something that you were either good at or not, given that feedback tended to be sparse. It was a large class, after all.\"",

Very policy-based. -Dorsey is incredibly intelligent and involved in the environmental policy world but doesn't lecture very effectively. Confusing presentations, mulls over his words enough to make you forget the first part of the sentence before he finishes it. -Howarth displays more enthusiasm and livens up his lectures, making them more accessible. -The readings are largely unnecessary and take up more time than anything else. -The book is COMPLETELY USELESS. DO NOT PURCHASE IT since you will be wasting several dollars and valuable time. At no point do the content of the readings ever get discussed, let alone tested. -The grading isn't very well done; the exams don't assess your knowledge of the material well. The issue briefs aren't worth enough in the grading scheme, but are enjoyable assignments. -If you are a non-major: take a higher-level course, since you DON'T need this one.

Often, this felt like an economics or government class. Both Professors Howarth and Erbaugh are excellent lecturers, were very flexible due to remote learning, and were very nice overall. Although Erbaugh did seem to be a bit more nitpicky than Howarth, I didn't find this to be worth stressing over. Class was only held once a week and the majority of the work was asynchronous, which was often more of a pain than anything else. The textbook reading was quite dry and overly long compared to the pre-recorded lectures. However, the workload tended to be manageable. Not a \"must-take\" class by any means, but compared to the horrors of some other remote learning courses, this was a perfectly acceptable experience.\""

They were graded so subjectively, mostly on aesthetics and how well you could artistically but concisely portray the loads of information given in the reading. Our TA graded most of the assignments and his office hours filled up so fast especially due to the high class size.

Anything remotely interesting was glossed over, while the exams were a combination of questions on random details and broad prompts about basic and obvious concepts. Pollutants in the atmosphere are interesting. So... I guess you should take a chem class if you want to learn more than random, rather fractured facts about them? Soil is pretty cool too, again, would one look to the Earth Science department to actually understand it? This class represents the worst stereotypes of interdisciplinary learning. Literally everything worthwhile in this class would be covered better in another department. If you're interested in scarce resources, take an econ class. If you care about the political implications, take a gov class.

There is a signifcant liberal bias to the course; as a liberal I didn't mind it, but I think Prof. Friedland does a good job being open to all kinds of perspectives and sometimes playing devil's advocate to introduce different ideas for discussion. You have to expect a liberal bias, it is the ENVS department after all. Friedland is a really nice guy and a fairly engaging lecturer.

After my experience with this class, however, I am thoroghly disenfranchised from this department. The basics: 4 simple problem sets (including an annoying project over thanksgiving break), 2 midterms and a final. This was a large lecture class, with many non-majors using it to fulfill distribs. Professor Friedland's lectures were boring, simplistic, and unexciting. The lectures were focused on general, common sense treatment of environmental issues that became more and more redundant as the class progressed. Lectures never explored issues and biological processes below the level of a middle school class. Many powerpoint slides were wasted with pictures of cars (seriously) and simple sentences. It was a real struggle to stay awake. The readings from the textbook, however, were much more interesting and detailed. The textbook emphasized important concerns that our generation must deal with in the future, and presented the material in interesting way that highlighted specific case studies. The failure of this class therefore lies in the disparity between class lectures and the reading. If exams tested what Friedland emphasized and taught in class, the class average would be ridiculously high. In reality, the exams felt more like playing a version of Trivial Pursuit from the 1970s. You could have a great grasp of important conceptial material, but unless you knew specific percentages or other detailed minutia you probably did not do so well. Some of the significant answers from the midterms were found in one-line sentences in the book. As someone else pointed out, perhaps the fact that this is survey course prevented delving into greater understandings of the subjects, yet the book successfully addressed more complex issues.

I found the workload for this class to be quite low (I averaged about 1.8 hours of homework in a typical week) but that does heavily depend on how much background you have in environmental science. Assignment-wise, the class has a quiz for each unit, two exams, and in between both required readings and non-required textbook readings as well as documentary reflections. As I already had a background in ENVS, I could skip most of the non-required textbook readings -- though they would be quite helpful for someone who does not have that background -- and the required readings were generally short and easy to understand. This term, quizzes and exams were open book and open note as well as online which greatly helped to reduce the burden of studying, so overall I thought the course load to be pretty light. Professor Peach and Professor Chaudhary are also incredibly understanding of students' needs, which is great to see.

They give about two days to take the exam, so I would say the professors tried to be as accommodating as possible. They also held multiple review sessions before the exams that were really helpful. If you care about the environment, I would recommend this class. Otherwise, it can get pretty boring since the content is so dense. The readings weren't too bad though, usually like 5-10 pages a day from the textbook. You definitely learn a lot, and it is very useful information. I loved the professors and I really enjoyed the class. As long as you maintain a good reading schedule and pay attention in class, you should be fine.\"",
            "review 3: \"21W with David Lutz And Morgan Peach: This class was honestly so boring, a six year old could take it. Unless you've never even heard of the environment and climate change you most likely wont learn a lot. The profs were honestly pretty cool but they sorta expect too much on the assignments, everything I submitted they always graded down and asked \"what else can you connect?\" regardless of the length or amount of content I'd submit. Kinda just grading too hard on a class that should be a complete layup.\""

            "review 1: \"18W with Ross Jones: Worst class ever. Very easy 3rd grade level material and you honestly don't learn much. Prof mumbles and can't answer questions in a straightforward manner, though he is a nice guy. Best thing about the class was the guest lectures. Grading is subjective and this class inspires nothing in the field of environmental science. Don't take unless you absolutely have to and if you're okay with feeling like you know the course well but are still okay with getting a B+. Also just fyi the median was 179/200, and a 180/200 was needed for an A-.\"",
            "review 2: \"18W with Ross Jones: Ross Jones is not the greatest professor. He talks slow and quiet... and mumbles, but there is basically no work for this class. 4 different problem sets that take 2 hours each, and that is all the work for the course. You don't need to do any of the reading. There is one midterm and a final exam, which you can study for just by looking at the slides. So, you don't really need to go to class. Pretty tough to get an A, but if you put in minimum effort, almost impossible to get below a B+.\""

            "review 1: \"21W with David Lutz: Took the class with both Lutz and Peach teaching. Online version kind of sucked because of the structure of the class. However, both profs were extremely passionate and kind. They really care for their students and are heavily invested in the content they are teaching. It wasn't too hard of a class, but I wouldn't constitute it as a layup.\"",
            "review 2: \"21W with David Lutz And Morgan Peach: weekly work was 3 warm ups, at first they took like ~90 mins, but the profs made them easier halfway through the term, and they took 60mins tops. 2 big assignments took around 6 hours each. 2 exams were 4-6 hours each as well. There is no final, just a final assignment with a lot of math and some graph-making. The warm-ups are short-answer essays, and the assignments and exams are an intensified version of the warm-ups, requiring much more outside research. All lectures are recorded, so you don't have to go to class. Do not take this class if you do not want to write essays. The profs were really sweet, but I hated constantly writing essays and doing outside research for this class. They give rubrics, but they don't grade based off of the rubric. They grade relative to how well your classmates answered the question, so you have to put in a lot more time than the hours I outlined above (or have a solid background in ENVS) if you want an A.\"",
            "review 3: \"21W with David Lutz And Morgan Peach: Professors Lutz and Peach are so sweet and caring. They are clearly very passionate about this subject and they definitely try their best to keep you engaged. The class is basically all lecture based, and they expect student participation. The readings and the main assignments were the hardest. The content isn't hard to grasp, its actually very interesting. Mainly, the work takes a really long time - especially if you want to get a good grade on it. We would have 3 reading checks each week, and all of them are discussed in class so you have to keep up with the chapters.
