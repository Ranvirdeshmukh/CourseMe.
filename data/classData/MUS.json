Taylor is so nice, so interesting, wants every student to succeed and is extremely accommodating. I turned in multiple assignments late and he did not care at all. Material is also super interesting. Work outside of class is listen to ~2 hours of music (and write about the songs as you listen) a week, 2 \"reports\" (report is a loose term, it's more like a candid discussion post) (one at beginning of term and one at end), meeting with your small group during x-hour to discuss listening, and a final project/presentation of either a biography or a creative project of your choosing.

So this review may not be super relevant to future students, but I'll leave it up here anyway. This class is a layup, but you should take something out of it as well if you put in the effort. Taylor is not a professor... he is a professional musician who cares deeply about the music in both an artistic and scholarly sense, but he does not come from an academic background. Therefore, the course is not super organized, and his lectures can be pretty spacey for those who have never interacted with him before. What he does bring is knowledge and perspective on jazz and music in general... a perspective that will change how you approach music in the future (for the better). If you do his weekly listenings and readings with care, do a thorough job on your independent listening/listening diaries, put a decent amount of time into your final project, and pay attention in class, you will see music in a different light. If you don't, you will still have a pretty low-stress layup if that's truly what you're concerned about.\"",

            "review 3: \"21F with William Cheng: One of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth, hands down. Not a layup in the sense of workload. The readings were incredibly lengthy but so interesting. I definitely spent more time on those readings than my readings in my humanities class. But I was drawn in and found myself finishing them. There is also a playlist with video game soundtracks. We had quizzes every week in regard to both the readings and the soundtrack, and the soundtracks were covers/variations so it was actually very difficult to identify at times (especially because I am not musically inclined). We had weekly small group gameplay and streaming, as well as \"recitation\" with TAs, which was super fun and was a great way to meet other students in the class. We played undertale, which I haven't played before, and I appreciated the discussions we had in class afterwards. I never knew that there was such a fascinating history of videogames and so much nuance in the games themselves. I casually play mobile games sometimes but I honestly learned so much in this class. If there's one class you must take at Dartmouth, it's this one. The professor is amazing and would often end class by improvising our favorite songs on the piano. He's a genuine, caring professor who actually invests his time to make sure that our mental health is well. The class is so interactive and honestly stays true to the \"meaning of life\" part of the name. Will definitely enrich a lot of your perspectives on games, music, art, and life in general!\"",
            "review 4: \"21F with William Cheng: This class is not the layup that it was considered in previous terms but it is still an amazing class. There are 3 requires readings and 1 optional reading every week that are interesting but usually quite long. There is also a playlist you have to listen to each week. The lectures are engaging and interesting and required since attendance is taken. Each week there is a quiz that tests your ability to recognize songs from the weekly playlist, has you identify which reading an expert came from, and tests you on material covered in the lecture. Each quiz also has a short essay based on the topic from that week. Additionally, there are weekly recitation meeting led by a TA that takes attendance where a small group from that section leads a discussion based on the readings and topic for that week. Every one has to lead a discussion and it is graded. There is also something called play pods where you stream with a group of people picked for you weekly and is graded and while fun these play pods can be difficult to plan due to time conflicts. All in all, this class is no longer the layup it once was but if you do the work an A is manageable and Professor Cheng is one of the best Profs I have ever had and I would highly recommend taking this class.\"",
            "review 5: \"21F with William Cheng: It wasn't the layup that my friends told me it would be, but I'd still take it. Very similar to COLT 001, applied to Video Games and their music. The Playpods are a bit of a grind to schedule, and it's weird telling yourself that it's homework. The Final was take-home, and there was no midterm, but weekly quizzes. You had to do the readings every week (a quiz section was on recognizing a quote from one of the readings and writing down its author. Sounds difficult but after the first quiz, you could learn how to do it based on vibe rather than memorization). The most annoying part of the quizzes was the music section, where you would have to recognize a song and write down its name from the weekly required-listening playlist, but based on feedback I think Professor cheng might be changing that next Fall. There were weekly discussion groups, which weren't bad. I think there are other parts of the curriculum that will probably be changed, but the constants are Professor Cheng's piano ability and his insanely welcoming attitude to students. I really don't want to criticize this class, it was great and he is a fantastic prof (advocates FOR grade inflation to his superiors, and explained his stance on the danger and underrecognition of overwork culture in the last class). It is no longer on the level of Araban Nights, and I would regard it as a layup with some caveats, but extremely doable, and a great academic experience. Would recommend.\"",

There is no final or quizzes, just weekly writing packets (~750 words) , a final 500 word essay on the most important things you learned from the class, and a presentation.

Global Pandemic Experience: Normally this class is 12 people, but over zoom, the class was expanded to 200 people, 50 from each year. While I would prefer any class in person, the class experience for VGML was still great. I would not wait to take this class just because of Covid. If anything, I recommend taking it ASAP because having a laid back but still interesting class like VGML right now is ideal. The world is falling apart, so treat yourself with a layup. The Vibes: The two 2-hour lectures a week are very relaxed and built a sense of community in our 200 person class. Cheng also keeps it lighthearted, even showing up in a CHARIZARD onesie one day. Work structure/load: Each week has a theme. There are 4-5 readings (50-150 pages total) assigned every week. There was a writing packet every week with three short 1-2 paragraph essays.

Over the course of the term we saw live performances from a former cowboy, Tim Eriksen (the other prof, who has a 1 man show), a bluegrass band, a shapenote singer, a protest-music quartet, a lesson on contra dancing with several live fiddlers and a caller who calls dances across the country, and we took a visit to the Shaker Museum in Enfield. The course covers a wide range of topics in folk music, including early Appalachian folk, the blues, bluegrass, coal music/protest music, ballads, shapenote singing, and cultural appropriation in music. Levin stressed that grading in the class is based on effort, so as long as you put in a fair effort on the final project and during class time, you will earn an A. Additionally, the final project is very open ended, so even if you have no musical bone in your body you are encouraged to try something musical and be graded on just how hard you tried.

I'm a music minor, but I haven't had too much exposure to music history, so every class, I learned something new. I personally like Romantic era music, but the class opened me up to a broader view of classical music, and Prof Beaudoin makes this process very doable for people of all musical backgrounds. During the class, we listened to and discussed about excerpts of modern classical music (starting from Beethoven and ending with present-day composers), and we also talked with guest speakers throughout the term. There were five weekly assignments ranging from writing short written responses/making a creative response (i.e., recording, composition, painting, poem), as well as a final paper & presentation for the later half of the term. Additionally, Prof Beaudoin is very understanding of circumstances that might come up throughout the term, which helped me a lot. He gives thoughtful feedback on all assignments and he is very available for office hours. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in modern classical music. And definitely try to take a class with Prof Beaudoin if possible!\"",
            "review 4: \"22W with Richard Beaudoin: I'm someone who had very deep-seated views and thought I didn't really like classical music at all before coming to this class. This class changed me. It turned me into a music major (I was a music minor before). It exposed me to a lot of really interesting music and showed me how it does (and doesn't have influence) today, while also showing me about the culture of classical music worship. Beaudoin is the best professor I've had at Dartmouth. Classes are scarily organized, and his enthusiasm is infectious. You can't not pay attention to what he's talking about, and he will change how you think about classical music (and maybe even music in general). There are weekly assignments in which he asks you to do something different each week. Sometimes it's more analytical and sometimes it's more creative. The final project is a 10 page paper about a contemporary artist and their work that you have to relate to the music that you study in the term. Beaudoin will give you a great grade as long as you show effort. In short, take this class.\"",
            "review 5: \"21W with Richard Beaudoin: Professor Beaudoin is an extremely engaging and kind-hearted professor. It's very clear that he cares a lot about his students and he was always available to help me out for matters both relevant and irrelevant to this course. He has definitely been one of my favorite professors that I've met at Dartmouth so far and would highly recommend anyone to take his course. In terms of the course itself, the course definitely helped enrich my perspective on music. Lectures were full of engaging readings, audio/video recordings, and artworks, and Professor Beaudoin invited numerous guest speakers throughout the term which provided a space for great discussions with current professionals in the field of music. In terms of assessments, there are weekly assignments, which serves as a time to engage with all of the readings/music/composers that we are learning for that week. Although most of the assignments require you to complete short written responses to his questions, some assignments require you to explore working with a variety of mediums (ex: in one assignment we had to create a work of art (painting, video, drawing, composition, etc.) as our response to listening to a piece which was awesome and fun). There is also a \"quiz\" where you read a musicological article and discuss it with the professor 1-on-1...and this might sound intimidating but it isn't \u2013 Professor Beaudoin makes sure that it feels more like an informal discussion to talk about a composer rather than some examination. The final project in this course requires you to research a living composer and write a paper that compares their composition to works we've studied in the course (ranging from Beethoven to modern composers). This paper is also not too difficult and Professor Beaudoin offers helpful guidance if you ever need support. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in studying the history of classical music...Professor Beaudoin is great and Dartmouth's music department is wonderful!\"",
            "review 6: \"21W with Richard Beaudoin: Had about a 50/50 split of first-timers and Music majors/minors in my class, but I wouldn't recommend this as a first Music class despite it being an A median. As long as you engage in class and are interested in the material it should all work out, but if you're not into it the 2 hours might drag and you might not really like it. I worked hard because I was interested and got the median so I look back on this class really fondly. Learned a lot about weird Music and took some pieces from this to self-teach on the piano.\"",
            "review 7: \"20W with Richard Beaudoin: Beaudoin is the man. I'm a prospective music minor, but there were kids in this class that didn't know how to read music who loved the class just as much as I did. Beaudoin gets really excited about what he's teaching, which is part of what makes this class so great. Beaudoin is scary organized, and has every whiteboard covered with his lecture plans/outline before you walk into the room. Usually there will be some sort of topical music playing in the background. Lecture is super interesting, integrating recordings, sheet music, videos of performances, academic articles, and visual art. I loved going to lecture. This class has a pretty average workload - 5 or so \"weekly\" assignments (each with a fair amount of reading associated with them), two quizzes (one in which you and Beaudoin discuss a musicological article, the other is a very doable/fair listening quiz), and a two-part final research project. Whether you like classical music or just need the art distrib, this is a great class to take. The only reason not to take this class is if you want to learn about Tchaikovsky - I don't think Beaudoin mentioned him once in the entire course, which was mildly upsetting.\""

            "review 1: \"22F with Rowland Moseley: Prof Moseley is THE BEST PROF AT DARTMOUTH HANDS DOWN!!!! Class is interesting and pretty easy to do well in. Weekly assignments/reading and listening which probably take like 3ish hours total each week. Read the textbook but no need to take detailed notes or anything. There's a midterm and final research paper / presentation which is pretty manageable cause he splits the process up over the course of a few weeks. Midterm is surprisingly hard but he curves real well. No need to know anything about music before hand but the class is def a little more interesting if you do, he caters to all prior knowledge levels. Basically, here's a class with an amazing amazing amazing professor, relatively easy, and just all around a good time. Take it!!\"",
            "review 2: \"22F with Rowland Moseley: Great class overall. Pros: consistent, relatively easy assignments. No final exam (final paper instead). Small class size. Cons: Moseley seems pretty disconnected from students at times. He is clearly very passionate about music, but almost to the extent that he's not really personable in any respect. He didn't do anything to acknowledge the suicide of a 23 the class after everyone was notified, it's as though music is his first language (which is great, musically), and connecting with people isn't for him. Overall, I'd recommend the class but don't expect (1) Prof Moseley to seem anything but musically robotic or (2) to focus on the great composers of the 1800s (Liszt, Chopin, etc.) as you might be expecting (prepare to spend a lot of time discussing worthless stuff from the 20th century). Lowkey the final project kinda sucked because it would have been nice to select a piece from the modern classical period (1800-now), as the name of the class suggests, and write about it. Instead Moseley had everyone pick a modern piece from a living composer who was not represented in the Dartmouth library in any capacity and write about its value and why we thought it should be included. Evidently, this requires a lot of BSing. If you're taking this class for the same reason as me (passion for the 19th century Romantic greats), you might be a little disappointed. Nothing filled me with more boredom this term than painstakingly writing an awful final paper because I simply didn't care about the subject material that I was discussing (some garbage piece composed after 2015 that actually sucks, even though I was able to write an entire final paper on how great it was). This was probably the first final paper I've ever written where I just said f*** it and submitted it way before I should've. Still got an A, though. Also, Moseley seems to only minimally appreciate any musical knowledge you have coming in (though you don't need any!, seriously don't let this discourage you!!!!!!), and assignments in which you talk about the techniques, textures, tones, etc. of a specific piece won't really be appreciated because Moseley always wants something you say to be connected to present and/or historical context. Class was overall a 6.3/10, but don't expect to spend the entire time delving into glorious pieces. Most of the second half of the course focused on pieces that most simply wouldn't even consider musical. It's hard to describe, but we would listen to them in class and I would simply tune out because to pretend that anything Moseley was saying actually resonated would be to lie to myself. Look up \"Destination Freedom\" as an example if you want one. I could name countless others, but that would be excessive. Take this class, though, pretty interesting for the first half of the course. It was great to have some guest artists come in, and it's probably an easy A class for your ART distrib. I overall enjoyed it and will revise my rating of the class to 8.1/10. The -1.9 is because of the musically robotic style of the course and the lack of appreciation for analysis of musical technique and structure. Overall pretty fun though. Highly recommend.\""

Still a very interesting class, and Beaudoin is a passionate and good teacher.\"",

Prof. Beaudoin is extremely knowledgeable about the way music history, music theory, world history, and the 21st century interact, and as confusing as some subjects can be, he manages to explain them in interesting, understandable ways. If nothing else, take this class just to experience Prof. Beaudoin's teaching style - he is one of the best professors I have had at Dartmouth. Classes are mostly lecture / listening to music, but with discussion questions thrown in throughout, especially with regards to how that class's music selections make you feel, or what they remind you of. Classes range from general (an overview of the Baroque style) to technical (explaining different systems of tuning in slightly mathematical terms) to historical (discussing the music/life of specific composers). This course helps explain the development of music as we know it. If you are a music major/minor, consider taking MUS 21 (counterpoint) with/before this class - having that background made this class even more interesting to me.

Prof is great at explaining the philosophy of conducting, but not so good at giving instruction as to how to physically communicate musical ideas. She is also a bit disorganized. On the other hand, it's definitely a low-stress course, and the workload is absolutely minimal. Makes a great soph summer class. Furthermore, the TA I had was very helpful, and a good person to go to with any questions. It may not be a conservatory course on conducting, but it's quite enlightening, especially if you put some effort into practicing in front of a mirror and analyzing scores.\"",

If you're interested in choral music and opera, get to know him - he's the kind of lifetime mentor that musicians need. On the lessons side, my voice has changed so much for the better since I started studying with him. To be fair, the root of that was probably a term of a different teacher on the Vienna FSP after 3 with Louis, which was a sort of catalytic kick start I needed for myself. In that regard, Erma is probably the better choice for most people (especially those with some previous lesson experience) because she actually makes you practice. Louis kind of forgets the progress you made the previous week and so you can get stuck in a Groundhog Day situation if you are lazy, which might be what you want if you're in it for the insane work:credit value. It's just a shame the lessons are only 45 minutes each - they should be 75 min in my opinion. But I get demand is high and there are only two of them. On that note, email them during the term before you want to take lessons, buddy up with them, and have any friends already taking lessons give them an elbow, and you should be able to get in, though the demand can be pretty high.\""

Professor Taitt is an incredible teacher and does a great job of balancing creating a comfortable learning environment while also pushing his students. I had some experience playing piano coming in but I had zero jazz experience which made for an extremely fulfilling learning experience. I wasn't learning how to play piano but was instead learning an entirely new way to do so.

I took 3 terms of piano with Gregory Hayes, and I started as a very beginner on the Clark book (I knew how to read music pretty well since I played cello before, but didn't have much piano experience). Not gonna lie, the first term was pretty boring \u2013 but that is to be expected since I was building up fundamental techniques. The big difference between Greg's teaching style and other private lessons I've taken in the past was all the historical background/music theory he had on each of the pieces I was playing. The man is truly a historical bank of information and knowledge, and I've never met someone more knowledgeable about music. He was also pretty accommodating with sickness and other reasons to cancel. Additionally, a nice perk of taking piano lessons is that you get access to the grand pianos in the practice rooms (some are really nice, others are pretty worn down but they're all Steinways). The structure of the course is 8 1 on 1 meetings throughout the term and a final \"recital\" class where you play in front of the other piano students. The biggest part was the dedication to daily practice... more so than any other subject, music is something you truly can't BS or cram. He grades on progress, so you live and die by practice. I had gotten used to just cramming a problem set for 4 hours the day before it was due, or doing papers the night before etc. Piano became the class I dedicated the most time to due to 1-1.5 hours of practice 5-6 days a week. Overall, although I don't regret taking the class, I definitely won't take it again due to how much time it took for me. The biggest thing is that you need to treat it as a class, not an extracurricular hobby.\""

He tells some great stories in class that you would never get from a textbook or from documentaries. This course exposed me to tons of amazing music that I never heard before, and probably would not have listened to at all in my lifetime otherwise. Dodge assigned A LOT of listening each week, and about 50-70 pages in the text per week. He gave one listening quiz, a midterm, and a final. There's also a 20 page term paper that you choose the topic for. Overall a great course, but you need to put in the time to really learn about this stuff.\"",

I suggest possibly taking other music history courses before entering this one. I was the only person in my class that had no prior music classes, so I had a slightly harder time adjusting. I was taking the course because I did not know anything about 20thh century music and I was, and am still, thinking about a possible music major. This course's reading is not too extensive, but the listening is very important.\"",

It is up to the student to analyze and synthesize the readings, to come to class for information that is not already given in the other materials. The best parts of the course are the in-class listening portions, where Professor Dodge sketched fairly detailed analyses (particularly for Webern and Messiaen, among others). Also, guest lecturers near the end of the term (Larry Polansky, Ted Levin, David Dunn, Christian Wolff) shared valuable specific insights on broader ideas learned from other class materials. It's a good class, from which you can learn a lot, but you need to read the book, do the listening, and seek extra information if you really want to get a lot out of it.\"",

Professor Dodge was not always the most organized and clear lecturer, but he told a lot of great stories about the composers we studied, some of whom he knew and worked with. To hear stories like that is a special kind of thing, and shouldn't be tossed aside. We also had guests including David Dunn who gave a fascinating lecture on Harry Partch, and Christian Wolff (one of the New York School composers along with John Cage) talked in class about one of his compositions. Yes there was a lot of listening and the tests were tough, but I think that was necessary in order to do justice to the subject. Overall, a great class though I would not recommend it to non-majors who do not have a strong interest in 20th century European classical or related musics.

However, what this course lacks is actual structure in presenting the material to us.

I struggled initially on coming up with an idea of what to write about, but Paulin helped point me in the right direction and looked over an outline.

The man is literally a genius. He knows so much about music, it's ridiculous. I think he knows a little too much, in fact, because his lectures were often pretty erratic and he tried to fit too much information into class periods. If he could, he would start class a few minutes early and always held us a few minutes late. He used every single x-hour, at first for lectures, then for student presentations. 1 paper, 12-15 pages. You do a paper proposal, a first draft, and a final draft. Scott is pretty lenient about grading, but at the same time, you can't bullshit your way through the paper. It's worth most of your grade, and since Scott knows everything about music, you can't impress him with mere rambling (even though he's an expert rambler himself). 1 presentation. Choose a topic that we don't have time to cover in class. Choose two partners with whom you present this topic. Pretty simple. Weekly quizzes, first 15 minutes of class. They took many forms, sometimes short answer, sometimes involved in-class listening, sometimes multiple choice. I found them hard, even when I did the reading and listening assignments the night before. But that's probably because I didn't know a whole lot of music history before I took the class.

This is NOT an easy third class, especially if you aren't well-practiced in discussing and writing about music. The final paper was a very in-depth and challenging exercise for a lot of people in the class; Paulin has high expectations, but also lets you turn in a first draft that he reviews and comments on substantially. Overall, I found the course to be unnecessarily stressful at times, but a lot of this I think had to do with the sheer amount of music the department expects you to cover in one quarter.

            "review 1: \"07X with William Summers: I'll begin by saying that I wouldn't wish this course upon anyone, and I would have dropped it in a heartbeat if I didn't have to take it. No doubt about it, this course wrung the life out of my Sophomore Summer and left me for dead, a piece of shriveled roadkill on the baking asphalt with birds of prey hungrily pecking at my body. Here's why. Prof. Summers is hopelessly opinionated in his belief that \"historically informed performance,\" or the performance of early music using original instruments of the time, is the only way to experience and study music of the Baroque and Classical periods. According to him, no instrument has undergone a development - only changes - because a development would imply that the instrument improved in some way over the centuries. I venture to say it's difficult to find a musician today who will tell you that the modern piano is a clunky and ponderous piece of crap, and that the harpsichord and the piano forte are the true pinnacles of the keyboard family and have not been surpassed in any way. Yet, these are his beliefs, or at least, these are the beliefs we were subjected to in his lectures. Take it or leave it. The course work consisted of weekly quizzes (50% of the grade), a detailed concert review (10%), and large final research paper (30%). Participation and attendance were 10%. The main killer was the weekly quizzes. He would usually assign two hefty textbook chapters to study, as well as all the listening examples throughout the chapters. The first part of the quiz would be to identify - by composer, work, and specific movement - any of the listening from the chapters and whatever he felt like putting on reserve. For example, on the last quiz we were expected to be able to randomly identify any movement from Beethoven's 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 9th symphonies. The rest of the quiz was in essay format, and pertained to the material in the book and lectures. After a while, we got better at anticipating his questions and memorizing slews of useless dates, but his grading was always unpredictable and overly harsh. The research paper ended up being the most I've ever written for a course by far, and the concert review had to be done at the last minute and was a completely pointless assignment. In total, this ended up being an absurd amount of work, and when we asked for some quiz hints or gave the slightest complaint, he just scoffed at us for being lazy and said we should spend less time playing at the river. Well, thanks to him, I didn't even get to go to the river this summer or see sunlight for the last week of the term. Sure, the material probably makes sense to someone who's devoted most of their life to the subject, but he simply didn't understand that it could be difficult for anyone. Bottom line, don't take this course unless you absolutely have to or want to gamble with anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. The best thing about the course was the comradery formed between the 7 students who stuck it out, and I thank them anonymously for being awesome! I salute you guys...\"",

Everyone gets to share their projects with the class and it's an amazing experience to share your hard work & listen to everyone else's tracks.

The class is split into two units, one studying the instruments and instrumentation of a string quartet, and the other half analyzing wind quintet. Each of these units has 2 arrangements, one of a classical piano piece (usually Mozart) and one of some modern children's piano piece. These arrangements are all demanding yet fairly enjoyable, but as you effectively have an arrangement every other week, the work is very constant. On random class days, the professor may throw on extra reading/listening/arranging exercises due before class, which can definitely be a bit tedious. The final project is to arrange ~4-5 minutes of a decet - string quartet + wind quintet + double bass, and this is a TON of work (think 20-30 hours (if you care about the quality of your work)). However, everything is extremely rewarding since (at least when I took it), Moseley had professionals play our arrangements live for us, which was a super cool experience. All in all, it is a great class that teaches you a ton about instrumentation, and Moseley is a super awesome Professor (and super funny without meaning to be). Definitely recommend it, but I would definitely say not to treat it as a layup.\"",

Everyone in my class got A's kind of because they did pretty good work but I think mostly because it's a small class and Rowland loved us by the end. If you are stuck or confused with an assignment you can go to him and he will literally show you exactly what to do. Agreed with below review that strings suck to learn if you don't know.\"",

You'll have a great time if you have experience playing one of the instruments in the string quartet or wind quintet, but some sections (particularly strings) will be hard if you have zero experience with that family of instruments, as writing for them requires a little more thought than writing for voice or piano.\""

While this class is a major requirement, I took it for fun and I know that I might have enjoyed it more than some of my classmates did. This is because the subject of orchestration is very useless to someone who does not plan to arrange things in the future or does not plan to compose for an orchestra. So if interest is not there before entering the course, interest will probably not manifest itself. The course is also rushed a bit. It is really impossible to properly teach orchestration in one term, so in the ORC they talk about many different composers to be studied, but I felt like only a couple, mainly Debussy, were studied. And you go from arranging a piece for a woodwind quintet straight to an orchestra for the final exam/project. This is unavoidable and I would describe it best as practice because the subject matter of this course is one that can only get better by doing it and by practicing it, and in the short period of 10 weeks there is not enough time to learn it properly and practice it at the same time. Professor Dong was fair, however, and won't be mean in grading.

In terms of projects some students worked on compositions, others on the analysis of songs, and others on more niche interests. In addition to the project, which was pretty independent of the class, there were some weekly readings and responses. Additionally, Moseley made some optional final assignments on melody and rhythm (a paper and an exam) for those who wanted other grades besides projects, reading responses, and participation. The class itself was pretty varied, each day covered a new topic related to melody or rhythm from different cultures around the world. Topics included opera melodies, classical symphonies, Chinese classical music, Indian classical music, and South American/Caribbean and African rhythmic patterns. This was interesting at times, but made for a class which was a bit scatter-brained. Overall, a fairly laidback class which students could chose to work as hard as they wanted.

            "review 2: \"09W with Charles M.: Well, I had to take the course for another music course, but I didn't like the course at all. What could be interesting and approachable became uninteresting. In Music 20, as a sequel to Music 5, you review secondary function chords and then you get into harmony in the late Romantic era and atonal theory in the 20th century. Concepts presented in textbook are interesting, but unfortunately we had to learn stuff by ourselves as we didn't learn much in the class. It was good that Professor Dodge brought lots of CD's for musical examples (and scores as well, of course) but the problem is that he expects students to follow his analysis. He assumes that students will recognize chord aurally and rushes through the chord analysis. We didn't really learn how the chord is formally constructed and how the chord works in the musical context. Since he didn't cover that kind of background and went directly to the analysis of a Wagner piece, for example, it was no wonder that it went all over students' head. In that sense, we learned little. Certainly he wants students to appreciate many kinds of music. While I liked that part, I must criticize him for not teaching much during the class. My further criticism, therefore, goes on to the take-home midterm and the take-home final. With teaching so little he has an unreasonable expectation to students. They were \"doable,\" but it doesn't mean that it can be called an appropriate assessment for what students self-taught. The midterm was more approachable, but the final (with atonal stuff) was simply too much. Professor Dodge is really nice as a person, but as an instructor I must give him a low rating.

Professor Dodge gives random, vague, sporadic assignments that have no relevance to what we are supposedly \"covering\" in class. On top of that he is an unfair grader. He takes off HUGE amounts of points for minute details, and for answers that are right, just not exactly what he had in mind. Music theory is subjective in some sense. He might as well just hand out arbitrary letter grades. The ear-training portion of the class was ridiculous--the Professor expected us to pass an exam on things which we had never practiced but once a week in x-hour, and when we asked to practice them, he would go to the piano and give us these obscure drills nothing like what were going to be on our test. Also he expected everyone to learn to play the piano and pass a piano exam. That is not a fair requirement at all.

This is a great class for anyone who is interested in listening to a variety of pieces and analyzing chord progressions, musical form, etc. Besides from course lectures, there are weekly assignments (writing a short song, analyzing a song of your choice, etc.) that require however much effort you honestly want to put into the assignment. There is also a daily keyboard assignment portion to this course that is great for beginners, while anyone with piano experience will breeze through them. There are no big finals or midterms in the course, but there is something called \"micro-credentials\", which are three separate short exams (like 3-5 min) that you can keep retaking until you get a 100, and also a listening quiz at the end where you identify songs from the course playlist.

There are weekly homework packets that can be a little tough, but they really help in preparing for the midterm and final. Prof Dong really incorporates a listening component into her classes; she plays a lot of music in class which is really helpful and makes the harmonic analyses all the more relevant and interesting (there is also optional ear-training sessions during x-hours). She also brings in a lot of diverse perspectives on music, so we got a taste of nonwestern, non-tonal music as well as the traditional western theory. The small class size (9 people) also created a more comfortable class environment. I would definitely recommend this class!\"",

The musical examples she used were helpful, and the guests in class were great. The only complaint I have is that her lectures are often cryptic and confusing. On the other hand, she is always willing to answer questions after class and to work with students outside of class as well. As for the class material, the book starts with a lot of basic ideas and after four chapters starts to really get into how triad-based Western Tonal Harmony works. I found that with my background in music, the first few weeks of the course were really easy and then the course got harder. Still, the course generally wasn't hard, but did entail a lot of tedious homework assignments. Also, the midterm and especially the take-home final take up a lot of time though the final was fun. Harmony is a good course and I recommend taking it with Kui to music majors. Non-majors should only take the course if they do not already have a strong background in Western Tonal Harmony.\"",

            "review 8: \"02F with Kui Dong: If at all possible, avoid taking Music 20 with Kui Dong. The course material was interesting and the text book was helpful, but Kui is an awful professor. Class: Kui's classes were boring - she herself was not into the material and often complained of being too tired after teaching her 10a (ours was a 2a). Uninsipring: With about 20 minutes to go Kui often stopped and asked us if we wanted her to continue teaching or if we were as tired as she was. Sometimes she would let us go early. She once asked if we were all music majors/minors and suggested that if we weren't we should drop the class, because it would become increasingly boring and tedious. Relevance: Kui devoted some 4 class periods to visitors. They were all interesting, however they practiced 20th century music. Harmony is very much like a math class in that you need to come away with certain hard skills - it is not a music history class. These visitors took up important class time. Kui assigned three required concerts - these reflected her 20th century music tastes rather than ealier music which would have more relevance to a Tonal Harmony Class. Homework: One assignment per week - these usually took 3-5 hours. There was also text book reading. Exams: The midterm and final were both much harder than anything we had seen in the homeworks. For the midterm she told us it would be easy and gave us 5 hours for what she claimed was 2 hours worth of work. Most people took the full 5 hours. She did however curve or final grades to reflect that the difficulty of the exams. TA: Our TA was helpful, however I was surprised that she would hire someone who did not play the piano well. I also didn't understand why we needed a TA, given that his main function was to teach the x-hour and grade half the homeworks. I thought Kui should have taught the x-hour herself like any other prof. Other: At 18 (the department's cap) the class was too large.\""

All of my previous knowledge got covered by the end of the second week, and pretty soon we were doing a lot of new material very fast. The fast pace is one of the biggest things to be prepared for. It's not unmanageable, but as someone for whom it takes new material a while to sink in, this class was challenging. One issue I had was with the Ramellian Analysis, which make up large portions of both the mid-term and the final. You have very limited time for all his quizes, exams, etc. and he really sticks to his time limits. He gives pretty frequent quizes which I found helpful in letting me know how I was doing/if I was getting the material. Although the homework wasn't necessarily the most interesting, it was extremely helpful in reviewing/reenforcing the material. All homework is required and graded, which means he really makes you practice the material. At the beginning of this course I was really nervous for the final composition, as someone who's always been pretty crappy at it. But honestly it was surprisingly easy, though time-consuming. Also, be warned that this class has 3 piano exams in it. It's mostly just playing scales, so if you've taken piano lessons it's probably very easy, but as someone without a background in piano, I found these exams difficult despite having practiced a lot for them. What's rough about these exams mostly is that if you miss one note in the scale, the whole scale's counted as wrong (each scale is worth 10 out of the 50 points, so playing 2 wrong notes means 30/50). Also, these exams count for a pretty decent amount of your grade. Overall, I think Duff is great. He learns everyone's names right away (which means he calls on people all the time--be prepared). He definitely isn't afraid to put people on the spot, which I personally don't mind, but for some could be intimidating. If you are having trouble understanding things or want to go over what you missed on a quiz, Duff is extremely willing to make himself available to help you out. Evenings, early mornings, whenever. Overall this is one of those classes where you can't not learn something. You will learn a lot and you'll learn it well. It really made me excited for Music 21.\"",

Just don't slack off. Do the Practica Musica assignents as they are a third of your grade. The x-hour mainly involves musical dictation and sight-singing. This class can be tough at times, especially if you have no prior musical experience. Some background on the keyboard is recommended.

There were weekly listening reports where we had to listen to 15 minutes of music every day and write about it. There was weekly solfege and ear training assignments. As annoying as they are, it does improve your sight-singing skills. There was a midterm and final, both of which had an in-class and take-home portion.

I played a wind instrument all my life and thought that this could serve as a fairly easy third class for my freshman fall since I didn't get into music 2. However, this was a very difficult and work intensive theory class which ended up being my most difficult class, from weekly singing assignments, weekly written theory assignments and listening journals to regular keyboard quizzes and written quizzes, this class kept me busy constantly. There are also required musicianship labs during every X hour which are essentially ear training and are very difficult. The musicianship lab had a midterm and a final which were pretty much impossible if you didn't have a knack for writing down notes as the TA played (I didn't). There are also a lot of grade boosters in this class as well though and the final composition, though difficult, is graded fairly easily.

Larry's got a sense of humor and is quite generous. He even brought free bagels to our final. Plus, he's a decent composer; check out his variations on the folk song \"Lonesome Road.\" That being said, Polansky does have a tendency to skim over some important concepts like tonicization, and he tries to downplay the difficulty of his tests. The final exam and composition were more difficult than expected. Still, it's not a hard class overall if you do put the effort in. The aural component with Duff was more stressful.\""

On the one hand, I look back on the class and feel like I gained a lot. It took me from an introductory awareness of the genre to a much deeper appreciation and understanding. It prepared me quite well for the Vienna FSP the next term. But then I start to realize that all the value came from the operas themselves, barely from Steve's video lectures, and certainly not from any in-class stuff. I have to give Steve considerable credit for the general setup of the class, because it pushes you to actually immerse yourself in the pieces, and write dynamic and engaging reviews. In that sense, for my demographic, it's more like a rewarding independent study. Again, this is from my personal musically-involved perspective; definitely a way different experience for the athlete who used ChatGPT to write a review about the wrong \"Figaro.\" As with many music courses at Dartmouth, the nonexistent entry barrier to boost enrollment means that Steve has to cater to the lowest common denominator (forgive the musical elitism). Resulting class discussions lack actual analysis. I came to resent sitting there in Sudikoff. It pained me because I know Steve truly knows his stuff, and yet here we were re-watching random aria clips from the video lectures, watching him tear up playing piano excerpts from memory (he shreds I'll give him credit), or awkwardly small-group discussing how Puccini makes you *feel*. I won't go into Steve's personality because he is so hit-or-miss with people; I still can't even decide how I feel about him, even though I know he really liked me (or at least my reviews lol). I certainly don't see him as the perspective-changing guru that he clearly wants to be and that a lot of people buy into. Thank god he cuts most classes in half - a fact that reviews don't mention, and one that actually DOES make this class a layup, in my opinion, as long as you use the time he gives back to you to watch operas.\"",

My honest advice, though, if that if you fully immerse yourself into the work and give yourself ample time to reflect on it, you won't mind the work because of the immense amount you are learning. Meanwhile, Steve is an outstanding prof in the classroom. He's more passionate about the subject he teaches than any prof I have seen at Dartmouth, and maybe any educator I've had in my entire life, such that it's hard not to share his enthusiasm for opera by the end.

Swayne is so passionate about what he is teaching that I can't remember a single class period where he didn't literally start crying. He even cries in the asynchronous recorded lectures.

But just because there isn't a lot in the way of work and grades that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to be learned. Challenge yourself to learn in a new style! Prof Shabbaz is quite smart and manages to be an academic professor, yet also chill and sometimes a little sprititual too. He gives a lot of random speeches on life, which I enjoy.\"",
            "review 14: \"02W with Hafiz F.: This class is so much fun! The workload is light, but what you do learn is meaningful. Take this class if you're interested in music, especially afro-cuban, and you'll definitely enjoy it.\"",

Prof. Shabazz's teaching style was very disorganized. He would often vaguely mention an assignment, but not fully explain it until weeks later. He didn't even hand out or mention 2 (out of the four total assignments we had for the entire term) until the very last day of class, and that was only because students reminded him - he probably would've forgotten about them completely otherwise (not that that would've been so bad, considering all of his assignments were open book quizzes that had little to do with what we did in class). He also didn't allow enough time for to prepare for our final performance, or for students to give their presentations. Even though Prof. Shabazz is a very dynamic and knowledgeable person, he is not very adept at clearly teaching material. He seemed to assume that we could all learn a drum rhythm w/in a few minutes, and didn't take the time to make sure people were playing correctly. Also, he didn't really teach anything else in class besides the rhythms. He would just occasionally mention names or places, but never do it in a fashion condusive to students taking notes.\"",
            "review 16: \"02F with Hafiz F.: It is appalling that such a course should be offered at an Ivy League institution, and even more appalling that it should be required for the Music major/minor. Professor Shabazz, while a skilled drummer himself, possesses absolutely no talent for teaching and spends his lectures sermonizing a very bored audience in an extremely patronizing manner that inspires no discussion. They are often trite diatribes on absolutely random topics, though his favorites include ethinicity (which he forcibly insists all his students beat to death) and racial injustices. They also typically include some New Age-y spiel on How To Live Life. While it is the quintessential college experience to wander in ontological circles with friends/roommates at 2 AM in the morning while procrastinating, it is quite another to waste college tuition and class time pursuing these topics. While one's academic pedigree certainly cannot be the sole criterion by which others assess one's value, Professor Shabazz's decided lack of skill as a professor is a reflection on his clear dearth of academic training. At the beginning of each class, Shabazz insists on asking each student to rank how he/she is feeling on a scale of 1-10, and the more mundane minutia and detail one imparts, the better. This takes up approximately 30 minutes of a 2 hour class. The course has no structure whatsoever and has no goals whatsoever. Perhaps one would find such freedom in a Dartmouth course exhilirating, except there was actually substance to learn or insight to gain. \"Listening exams\" and \"Take home exams\" had nothing to do with course material (though it is difficult to say exactly what the course material was), and the \"Group Project\" was extremely disorganized. Unfortunately, to add insult to injury Prof. Shabazz insists that students actually attend his weekly sermons, as there is no course material, and the grade seems to be based on attendance alone. If you are looking for a gut course, and are willing to put up with the torture of wasting 4 perfectly good hours per week and with a very annoying professor, this is the course for you.\"",

I think goal oriented people may have trouble with the structure of this class because there is, well, none! I really enjoyed his lectures [not necessarily about music, more about life/being a person]. He is obviously a living breathing person who is passionate about his field and I don't think we get enough of that from our professors at Dartmouth. Drumming is fun too, primal in a way. I can't summarize what I learned exactly but it was more than your average class at Dartmouth--academically and non. It was nice to learn for once without having to be anal about requirements and grades. I recommend this class for anyone who wants to take a break from the usual oppression of the Man and have some fun.\""

The reading was actually pretty interesting-- especially the articles, but sometimes we'd have two pieces to listen to and an article and a chapter out of a book, and it was just too much.

Didn't really convey a true love for the music. Gets disappointed when everyone gets a 14/15 on a quiz, because it was too \"easy.\" Doesn't know how to lecture clearly.

However, all of the coding was taught with the purpose of artistic applications. Workload is manageable; there were small weekly homeworks as well as four larger assignments and no midterm or final.

Guest lectures were brought in without regard to their relationship to course material, grading was arbitrary at best, and assignments were poorly thought out. 30% of the grade is based on her subjective assessment of you as a student (far too much discretion for a professor to have over a student's grade and furthermore I do not trust her--I think she holds grudges). 40% of the grade is based on group work. In a college course nowhere near that much of one's evaluation should be based on the work of others. Going into the final day of class (during Reading Period, another violation of my time as a student) I know 10% of my grade. It is unfair to a student to give them little to know idea of where they stand in the course. Overall Matsue ran a poor course. I went to every single class period and not once did she end on time. We always went over by at least 5 minutes. She does not treat her students with respect and often takes a condescending tone to them in class. She gets defensive when disagreed with and seems to enjoy pointing out the mistakes of students. A horrible experience on the whole when the subject could have been so interesting and not treated with such a Western, ethnocentric bias.\"",

            "review 3: \"02F with Jennifer M.: This is a pathetic, pathetic, pathetic class taught by a completely uninspired and uninteresting professor, who (in my opinion) doesn't really know much about music, global or otherwise. How Professor Matsue is now in her second year of teaching at Dartmouth is beyond my comprehension. Out of the 25 or so times the class met this fall, I think she only taught 20% (poorly). Four of the classes were given over to visiting musicians, yet none of these presentations were linked to the course material. Eight of the classes were set aside for group presentations: each group did an overview of a chapter in the high-school-level textbook that we were required to read anyway. Three more classes were set aside for another round of group presentations of our final project (which was to make a compilation CD of world music). These projects were an absolute joke -- the equivalent of making a mix tape in middle school. Five of the remaining class meetings were cancelled. Professor Matsue is clearly riding on the priveledge of position at Dartmouth. For the absurdly small amount of work the students did in this class, I feel quite confident that she did less. The saddest aspect of the class, however, was that it had absolutely nothing to do with music. Rather, it was a class about concepts -- appropriation of musics from other cultures and copyright issues took up the bulk of discussion. It's disgusting to me that a course sponsored by the music department would leave its students having gained practically no knowledge of the music that the course proports to examine. I can't say I find this suprizing, as Professor Matsue demonstrated on numerous occassions her lack of basic musical knowledge: she couldn't clarify the difference between harmonic and melodic material to students with little musical background; she couldn't play a 1-4-5 chord progression on the piano (which is easily the most used chord progression in most popular musics, and something a novice music theory student would be able to do). If Professor Matsue somehow manages to get her teaching invitation extended, do not take this class; it's just pathetic. I also recommend against taking her Ethnomusicology seminar (unless you're a major and you have to). If the music department has any integrity (and I know they do -- there are so many wonderful music courses), they'll get rid of Matsue and joke course offerings.\"",

Professor Levin does require you to attend concerts, but in my personal opinion this is great since you get to write reviews on them. Levin really shines when he is talking about his specialty, the Tuvans, and it was great when he brought two different groups. The amount of guest speakers is simply amazing and cannot even be put into words. We had a lady who did research in Cuba come in and we drummed up a Cuban-style Santeria religious ceremony; we had the Newstead Trio come in and play a 23 minute Mozart composition 2 ft. away from us, we had the two Tuvan bands which didn't speak a word of English (don't worry, Levin speaks Russian), we had a piano teacher come in to teach us about Beethoven. As a non-music person I was simply fascinated by everything the course offered. Problems: The class was not that great. Discussions were fairly dull and participation was limited to a few students. Levin sometimes has a tendency to want to lecture too much without involving the class. Nonetheless, the class is as much at fault here as the professor. Also problematic was the final research paper which felt very forced. I would highly recommend getting an early start on this. It seems almost irrelevant to the course material but I think the writing department is more to blame here than prof Levin. The Prof: Levin is amazing. Not only has he lead a crazy life and his research is in a field that none of you guys have heard about (Tuvan throat singing), but also he is a very well versed person. Many times in class he would rush over to the piano and begin to play something. He was really good about making sure the course was accessible to all people (though a little music background couldn't hurt) and was very passionate about teaching. Sure his comments on papers were vague but he offered looking at drafts for any assignment! This means that if you went to his office he would essentially correct your paper for you, and even better help you identify general writing problems, and then you could turn in something that guaranteed would get a good grade (only disadvantage is that this is fairly time consuming). He simply offered so much time up to students and was VERY understanding. A lot of times he changed due dates and was always willing to give extensions.

            "review 3: \"08W with Douglas Perkins: This course was a great intro to \"the history of Western art music;\" it covered music from around year 500 to the present, moving through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque Period, the Classical Period, the Romantic Period, and the \"Twentieth Century\" (encompassing various strains of modernism and alternatives to modernism). Listening to the classical music we studied was obviously a huge part of the course, and the CDs that came with our textbooks were a huge help in that area. I feel that the course made me much more open to listening to -- and attending live performances of -- classical music on a regular basis. The final grade for the course was based on two exams within the term (36% together, @ 18% per), the final exam (24%), two concert reviews (30% together, @ 15% per), and class participation and attendance (10%). The workload was quite reasonable, consisting of reading the textbook, listening to the appropriate listening selections, and attending two concerts and writing reviews for those concerts. The class was taught in a discussion-based format in which the students were called upon informally to supply the (beginnings of) answers to questions that Prof. Perkins (\"Doug\") posed. Some students suggested that Prof. Perkins do more actual lecturing, but I found his teaching to be effective nonetheless. Prof. Perkins was effective also in exposing us to new music that had substantial connections to the music of different periods in the past that we studied and in bringing in artists/performers, conductors, and composers to class to supplement our learning. His background as a percussionist made for some interesting insights and class discussions. The course was definitely rewarding overall.\"",
            "review 4: \"08W with Douglas Perkins: Perkins was a great professor for this specific class - he was very laid back and casual, which worked well with a small class. He's also incredibly nice, and brought in interesting extra material. He also found guests: in my opinion, one was fun, one was boring, and one was phenomenal. I definitely learned a lot, even though the class was easy (although the class was made substantially easier for me because I had some general knowledge of music history). The tests were clear-cut, the concert reviews a little less so - but other than that there wasn't much work. Reading the text was a good idea, though at times dull; but Perkins did an excellent job of presenting interesting music and concepts, which made up for that. The final class involved all of us playing a modern music piece, which was actually incredibly fun!\""

No matter how hard I studied, he seemed to put pickier and more obscure questions on each quiz - and then mark wrong certain answers that were found in the textbook.

Professor Lyon teaches how to operate Csound through in-class demonstrations and then has the students attempt using Csound in a series of take-home labs. Each lab takes you step-by-step through each exercise, and at the end of every lab is a chance to create your own arrangement using the techniques you just learned in the lab. This course has plenty of guest lecturers and also a number of requisite performances that you'll have to attend and eventually you'll have to turn in three concert reviews as part of your grade. This part of the course got pretty annoying at times, it depended on whom the guest lecturer was. The lecturers ranged from boring and uninteresting to hostile and arrogant. Still, the guest lecturers do give you a varied appreciation for the development of electronic music. Probably the best part of the course is finishing and presenting your final project.

The course began far with material far more basic than was described in the ORC, which may just be Dodge, but I was glad, since the description left me a little frightened. The course did an excellent job of sweeping through a fair amount of material and remaining thorough on all of it, though the one part I felt was lacking was application to euphony--it was easy to learn what all the terms and techniques are called, but the students' compositions from late in the term sounded as confused as the early ones, only with more complex chords doing the screwing up. I wish more attention were paid to using the learned techniques pleasantly in music. Other than that, the class was wonderful, not uncomfortable for a beginner, with plenty of opportunity for extra help via the T.A. (who also gets an A for his job in this course, though he's graduating so I doubt it will help anyone). I highly recommend taking this class if you at all enjoy music, for it will help you to appreciate and wonder at the workings of it the same way you appreciated the flight of a baseball when you began learning parabolas.\"",

He did not care about attendance, and we only had to hand in our homeworks and take the listening exams. The listening is a little frustrating, only because it doesn't reinforce the concepts. Its easy enough though, as long as you do make an attempt to listen. My main point is to make sure you take this class with Appleton, or my review isn't applicable.\"",
            "review 3: \"05W with Jon H.: The MUS 2 classes are all taught differently by different profs. Most of our grade was from homework assignments (which could sometimes be time consuming and annoying). The other percentage of our grade was from listening exams, in which we had to memorize music and write the composer, movement, title, etc when played in class.\"",
            "review 4: \"05W with Jon H.: This was a fun course, but it was very, very easy. It basically breaks down like this: I learned music theory from the textbook and exercises, and I went to class because Prof. Appleton is an interesting person and he assigns some very good listening. Essentially, Prof. Appleton did not teach much theory. Which was actually very good, for the most part. Everyone learned from the book, and then class time was spent clarifiying points. If we had done the actual material in class, it would have been painfully boring. Instead, we spent some time answering questions, some time analyzing assigned listening, and a lot more time enjoying Prof. Appleton's non-sequiturs. The grade for this course is based on the exercises from the textbook, which are all done at home. Most of them are easy with practice and only a few points are lost for stupid mistakes. The biggest flaw of the class was the lack of theory tests. Prof. Appleton only gives listening exams; he plays a piece from our assigned listening and you have to identify name, composer, and other significant ideas. While this was kinda fun and I enjoyed the exposure to lots of great classical music, I never actually forced myself to memorize a lot of the theory because we were never tested on it. You can, of course, force yourself to memorize it on your own, but without the tests there's no motivation when you have tons of other work due for other classes. I'm not sure if Prof. Appleton is going to be a fair grader or not, but theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to do well on all of the exercises and tests without too much effort. This is a good class to learn the rudiments of Music theory, have some fun, and/or take a break with a really easy class (Prof. Appleton doesn't require attendance except on test days).\"",
            "review 5: \"05W with Jon H.: I took this class thinking it was going to be about music theory, but it turned out to be a lot more about listening to and identifying pieces of music. Homework was really the only time when theory itself was focused on; most of the time Appleton would spend class time discussing a single piece or movement of a piece. The tests had nothing to do with the textbook homework and instead were based on just the listening assignments. That being said, the class was interesting and a good way to be exposed to classical music, and Appleton's comments/interactions with his students are hilarious.\"",
            "review 6: \"05W with Jon H.: Appleton rarely covered material for the homeworks, which made up 66% of the grade. The book was horrible and the TA held sessions once a week to discuss homeworks, when up to 3 assignments could be due in a weeks time. Although Appleton is hilarious alot of time was wasted due to his stories and shenanigans, while some of classtime was spent on the listenings.\"",
            "review 7: \"05W with Jon H.: If you're a musician already, especially a pianist, you'll have a leg up in this class. If you're not, you will be lost. True, the class begins with the most basic of theory, but quickly it moves on to more and more complex concepts that build on everything that has come before, so it's easy to flounder in the daily and required book exercises that always seem like busywork after the fourth or fifth page. The listening exercises aren't bad though, and you might just find there's a classical composer or two that you like. The main reason to take this class is Prof. Appleton, whose class lectures are completely scatterbrained and unorganized but he's a lot of fun, entertaining even. Whether or not that makes up for the course's deficiencies depends on how much music theory you know going into the class.\""

The small project and the final project were pretty easy to do well in, and so was the concert review. The two exams were not super easy to study for, but there was a curve and grading was fairly generous. There's also a 25% participation grade which you literally just have to show up to class for. I would say it's a lay up for the most part, just don't cram study for the music exams, especially the second. Each exam has 40 songs you need to memorize, but for the second exam they can be up to an hour long, and you have to know the composer, genre, year, song name, and all the musical elements. Again, it is curved but just don't cram. Would recommend the class. 95% is needed for an A, but there is also extra credit.\"",

Some focus on ear training, difficult stuff if you've never been exposed to it, lots of students were struggling. Kui is nice but kind of spacey, I'd love to take a more advanced theory/composition class with her, but I think she's too far away from intro theory to know how students feel about it just learning.\"",

If you show up to every class, make a valid effort, and complete all the assignments, you get an A. Everyone got some type of A. Professor Dong is an okay lecturer. She repeats what's written in the book, and that is sastifactory for the purposes of this course. Read the book and you'll be fine. It helps to have some sort of musical instrument that you can play for the final presentation, and also to be able to read music to help with your composition. Also, if you do more work than you have to, i.e. extra analyses, compositions, or concert reviews, you get extra credit.\"",

Stuff you'll need to know if you want to take more advanced music classes. But you won't really learn anything else. If you already read music, and play an instrument, this class will bore you to tears. If you don't, it'll mostly be memorization. Scott Douglass, the TA, was amazing.\"",

I have been playing music for about 10 years and I had to study for a grand total of about 5 hours over the entire course to understand everything. There is a lot of busywork, the likes of which you probably haven't seen since high school. The weekly assignments are generally pretty easy but they always take 5+ hours to complete. You have to learn basic piano skills, which is good if you want to learn piano but sucks if you don't care about it. Every x-hour is used for an 'ear-training' lab during which you listen to the TA sing melodies that you write down. Very easy if you are good at that, probably really hard if you aren't. Professor O'Neal would put me to sleep every morning with her dry, slow lectures.\"",
            "review 3: \"07X with Melinda P.: The ORC says that this course is for those with little or no music experience -- unless you are okay with putting an extreme amount of time and effort into this course. I have eight years of music experience (but no music theory) and parts of it were still tough for me. Far too much of the grade is based on ear training (mostly being able to identify intervals) for a non-major/minor intro to music theory, not an intro to sight-singing or something. And ear training can be pretty tricky, unless you have perfect pitch. Also, Professor O'Neal's lack of piano skills were frustrating, as she would attempt to play pieces from the textbook, really messing up the rhythms, which I can't imagine was very helpful for those who had just learned to read music. But Professor O'Neal is a good teacher and explains the concepts pretty well (I find that often professors don't explain elementary concepts well because they forget what it's like not to understand them). She is especially helpful in office hours, too, so if you don't understand something, definitely ask her. Overall, she's just a really intense professor and wants her students to learn a LOT, which is fine -- but just be ready for it.\"",

The problem is that too much is expected, and the homeworks are incredibly Long and not worth it. Also, you have to take private lessons in piano, take ear training lessons, and more. The class is basically 80% ear training test, the mid term, and the final, and 20% homework and presentation. Not a good class unless you go in knowing about music. If you are like me and have not taking or done anything regarding music in your life, figure out another way to fulfill your ART distributive. This class was A LOT OF WORK!!!!!!\""

Professor Weiser tried especially hard to make this course unreasonably difficult to the point where he became viscious. He was trying to break the common misconception of music 2 being an \"easy\" \"gut\" class. -- and break that notion he did. This class was tough in that virtuoso music experts were mixed together with the music know-nothings like me. There was no distinction made between those with previous theory experience and those with none. I highly suggest that if you take this course, you have a fairly good feel for some of the basic principles of music theory before you begin. The textbook which was extremely expensive, was useless. The professor rarely referred to it, and never required reading from it. All tested material came from class lectures and from worksheets. The x-hour ear training labs were awful. There was a complete disconnect between the professor and the TA. There was no alignment between what the prof. expected us to learn during the x-hour and what was actually being taught. It was clear that the two of them rarely communicated and developed a structured plan for what was to be taught and how it would be taught. Tests were very challenging. Weiser's philosophy is to \"push\" his students on the tests. The result was long and overly difficult exams. The best parts about the class - writing your own composition - were crammed into the last week. If only we could have put to use more of the skills we were learning! The rest of it was very dull and boring - such is theory, however.... Only take this course if it is absolutely required for your major or minor.\"",

She was great on a one-on-one basis and I really appreciated the special attention that she was able to give me. I think that having a background in music will make this course MUCH EASIER for anyone considering it, but it is not impossible if you don't have any background. The class is fun because you get to sing and it's really interactive. I got to know a bunch of people from the class, and that is different for me (most of my classes are lectures and I don't get to know the people in my classes at all). Also, there are guests that come to class and that is really exciting. They are performers at the Hop and they talk to you about what they do with music and it's just really cool.

At the beginning we were listening to Steven Foster; on the very last day, Eminem. The scale for this class ended up being pretty compressed... he broke up the grades by what he called \"the natural break points\". Many times this translated into not very many percentage points.

If youre willing to be a bit frusturated with Swayne's evaluation methods and perhaps put up with a lower than normal grade to learn cool material take this course. Side note: I think that Swayne makes the grades in the course lower than usual on purpose because I think he feels a lot of kids sign up for this class thinking it will be an easy way to get an ART distrib. Therefore, to counteract this sentiment, he makes things pretty challenging...so don't go in to this course thinking it's going to be a cake-walk.

Covid definitely made it easier because normally we would have a piano lesson requirement, but even then it is barely any work at all. Would highly recommend!\"",
            "review 10: \"20F with Michael Zsoldos: Prof. Zsoldos is a great musician and professor. He is always energetic and at least this term was very helpful. Because of COVID the only assignments in this class were Inquizative assignments which were able to be retaken. Highly recommend taking this course for your ART distrib.\"",
            "review 11: \"20F with Michael Zsoldos: Prof Zsoldos was wonderful. He made class really engaging and fun, and I rarely think class is engaging and fun lol. He is really passionate about teaching everyone so its basically just a participation based class plus inquisitive assignments which you can take as many times as you want. Got an A without doing any real work and loved starting my mornings in this energetic environment. HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking to fill ART distrib or just looking to have a different academic learning experience!\"",
            "review 12: \"19F with Michael Zsoldos: Really enjoyed this class. It was definitely a layup, as it taught material that was super basic, moved slowly, and didn't assign a ton of work, but I was also lucky in that I had some musical experience going into it and already knew a decent amount of what we were learning. Still, if you're at all interested, this is a course you should definitely try to take. Zsoldos was a really nice prof who was super willing to answer anybody's questions, and he really cared about his students learning the material. Also, as part of the class, we all got free piano lessons, and at the end of the term, there was a piano test where we had to play a few basic pieces (but we had almost the whole term to work on them). Definitely a good way to start learning piano if you have no experience.\""

            "review 1: \"07S with Mary Ann: The class was a very fun experience. Aside from learning much about the history of American music, we also got a chance to experience it ourselves. The class involved a lot of listening to music, singing songs, and dancing. I highly recommend it to someone interested in American music or needs to fulfill an art requirement.\"",
            "review 2: \"07S with Mary Ann: This class was sometimes very boring to sit through, especially because it was a 2A and because all x-hours were required. But it is good for an art distrib and if you don't want to do that much work.\""

            "review 2: \"19W with Richard Beaudoin: Great and easy class. Weekly homework assignments due on Thursdays which are basically busy work. Beaudoin is super nice, really passionate, and funny. Have to do a 20 minute piano lesson once a week but its not very stressful. Definitely a good class to take, just have to do about 2-3 hours of work a week for an A.\""

            "review 1: \"17W with Michael Casey: The class was a good introduction to musical theory for people that have not have any previous exposure. The course load was definitely manageable, with readings not being longer than 20 pages a week, coupled with weekly exercise sheets that took some time but were more busy work than challenging. If you have previous piano or classical music experience this would definitely be an easy A plus an ART distrib. There is an aural component to the class so for people with no experience that can be a little harder since you can't learn that from a book and it takes time, as well as with the piano proficiency component for people with no piano background. Even then though it is still more manageable than most classes and grading is quite generous. As long as you go to class, show you're putting effort you should do more than fine. The class was also taught by two professors and a TA, with professor Casey teaching about a third of the classes. Other than that it was a cool class and prof. Casey and Zsoldos clearly love what they do, which you could see during class lecture.\""
