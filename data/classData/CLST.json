It was a great class for CLST majors and people new to Ancient Greek history alike, as well as people with and without GIS experience. The one page summaries about various kinds of diagnostic objects that stacked up in the middle of the term were a little relentless, but it was still a great class.

The information is really interesting, but the Professor has such a hard time articulating the true points and will draw on about a certain point. The online lectures were also typically 45 minutes over the actual length of time. There were also quizzes after every single lecture and after every single reading. There were three essays we had to write for this class. I have never been graded so harshly on opinion papers ever. The guidelines for the papers were extremely vague and left a lot of interpretation up to the reader. He graded the first paper a specific way, so if you didn't write it exactly to the way he wanted you to write it, you failed. The guidelines for that paper was a single paragraph describing a hypothetical scenario for you to write a paper on. That was it. The second paper was completely opinionated. You had to argue a certain point and you only got 5 pages. Again, if you didn't write it the way he wanted it written you didn't do well. Another classmate and I proof read each others paper and edited it to make sure it was coherent and made sense. We fixed them and turned them in, and we did not do well. He claimed our arguments were not clear and we didn't specifically say what our point is despite the fact that there were multiple CLEAR sentences about what our point was. He is honestly a horrible professor. I can't speak to what it would be like on campus, but the online version of this class is absolutely horrific. You could not get a hold of him through email and he didn't hold office hours because he thought that they weren't reasonable due to being online. I do not recommend this class unless you have to absolutely take it. Honestly, the information is not worth knowing to have to endure the horribleness of the prof.\"",

Not only is the subject matter incredibly exciting, but the Professor is the world expert in the subject who will do the best possible job of literally anyone explaining the topic. The lectures are so compelling I found myself voluntarily rewatching them so I could glean additional details. The papers are directly relevant to the subject matter and engaging to write. The midterm paper in which I had to debate how the Ancient Penthalon was scored, taking evidence straight from the archaeological record, is the most fun academic experience I have had in the past year. I also only put maybe four hours into it total and wrote it right against the deadline (it was taken pass or fail because of COVID, don't judge me) and still received a 100. I can't speak to how he responded to emails, but I will say he made himself available during optional lectures on his research interests. Further, Christesen gives one of the most persuasive cases for why the study of antiquity remains crucial to the educated, making this class a must-take for any majors. Fight me -- christesen.simp@dartmouth.edu\"",

There are three recorded lectures + three assigned readings every week, each with a quiz that is said to \"verify\" that you actually watched/read. These quizzes were not hard, but certainly not just some check in to see if you are actually participating in the class. You also have very limited access to the prof - once a week meetings via zoom with five of your classmates and that is pretty much it. He is terrible at responding to emails. Also, there are short responses worth 25% of your grade due each Friday, and he grades them extremely hard. There are also three term papers due and he does not take them lightly when grading either. The prof also has just an oh so fantastic policy of a grading scale in which an A is a 96+. HOWEVER, I found the topics of this class extremely interesting, and the professor is at the very top of his field. I would recommend taking the class when it is in person, because every one of my problems with the class, aside from the strict grading (which presumably is not rare here), stemmed from the online features. Take this class when we are all in person again; please take my advice and do not take it while we are completely online.\""

He keeps the lectures (which can be on very dry material) interesting, funny, provocative. This is one of those classes that gives you what you put into it. You can go to the lectures, write the papers, and take the finals without doing much reading and get an 'A'. If you're looking just for grades, well, it can be done with a minimum of work. But Prof. Rutter gives you a ton of great reading assignments, and if you actually look at the optional reading material, you'll learn A TON about the subject. Keeping up with the regular reading is time consuming, doing the optional is probably only for those whose main interest is Ancient Greek culture. The required readings will be quizzed, but you can get around doing the reading by just reading the answers to the quiz questions that others post on Blackboard (he posts possible quiz questions every day on the website). I don't recommend this; do the reading. This class can either be really time consuming, or not time consuming at all. It's completely up to you. Pick your own level of involvement. Oh, one other thing, on the papers- do them right. Rutter won't accept any crap, and he's such a good prof that you really don't want to let him down. If you turn in some schwag he'll know it, don't think you can trick him just because you know some big words and are somewhat familiar with the archaeology. If you do the papers right, they'll be some of the most important you do for your undergrad degree> you are really forced to do quality research. I think he takes attendance every day. I don't know how much this counts for, if anything. It's always a good idea to go to class, though. Christesen will make you work and make you learn the material, but you'll hate every minute of it.

There is a quiz every Monday on the powerpoints from the week before, and also a page long summary of the reading due every class (the readings are not too long, it takes usually about 1 hour to read and write). These are graded on a check, check-plus and check-minus scale. Work load is manageable and she makes it very easy to do well in the class if you hand in the work. Also offers extra credit if you go to office hours\""

Professor Christesen is very available outside the class, the other students in the class were great--few class discussions work as well as they always did in this class. In general, I would only advise taking this class if you have two other easy courses lined up, and if you're interested in the subject matter.\"",

We had papers due every day in class, and quite a few due on Saturdays as well, presumably because it was a 2A and only met three times a week (we always used the x-hours). Most of these papers were done in groups, so they ended up being huge packets of information that we turned in. Each week focused on one sub-discipline of classical study: literature, architecture, numismatics (study of coins), pottery etc. Interspersed throughout were 10 minute individual presentations on prominent theorists who structured and described ways of understanding and communicating history. This was actually really interesting and I am sure that as a history major I will benefit from having learned about these. In general though, there was an overload of information and I never felt that I completely grasped any of the subjects we studied. The culminating experience was a 15+ page paper (mine ended up being ~45) on a topic of our choice. We also had to make a 20-30 minute presentation in front of the class on this same topic. It was really interesting to see what students came up with, and the whole process is great practice (I assume) for a thesis. However, I have never been more stressed out in my life. Christesen is awesome as usual and puts in more time into the class than any of his students. He literally spend 6 hours reading my first draft and then another 1.5 hours talking to me about it afterwards. This definitely makes the workload more worth it. I would only really recommend this class for people who are considering writing a thesis or hope to prepare for history graduate school, because you have to be an intensely hard worker and it really helps to know that the information you are learning will be helpful for your future.\"",

It's like a crash course in classics that will give anyone a firm basis in various aspects of the field...in that way it's almost like an intro course rather than an upper-level one, but the workload and level of understanding that is expected of us is what certainly makes it an upper-level beast. There were a bunch of upperclass classics majors/minors who had seen much of the material before and for whom the work was tiresome...so I definitely advise for any possible classics majors to take this course as a freshmen or sophomore or else stay away...although I don't know what us freshmen would have done without the upperclassmen in the group projects or class discussion...we would have been lost without all of you (except one \"structuralist\" who may have made everything a little more confusing). Without Professor Christesen there wouldn't have been a class, and my comrades and I may have hated him at certain times throughout the term, but he is by far the most devoted teacher I have ever seen or could imagine ever existing. I'm pretty sure he read nearly every word of what I wrote over the entire class, and doing that for everyone must have been truly brutal. Overall, I won't be forgetting classics 19 anytime soon...if anything it was a memorable experience, and it's where a bunch of us FSP'ers got to form an initial bond (that I'm sure will be tested over the next year).

Every day Christesen will assign a good chunk of reading (50-150pg) and a question. You are expected to write a paper on that question, and most people tend to do 4-5pg for it. Basically, you're reading around 300pg and writing 12pg per week, and yes, he does grade ALL of it. The course doesn't really have a syllabus or a set format. Basically, you just spend a week or two looking at different kinds of evidence (we did texts, coins, pottery, architecture), interspersed with discussion about western philosophers who have contributed to the study of history. I found it all to be very interesting, although some of it may be incredibly boring for those who have lots of experience in the Department. In the second half of the term, you pick a research topic and write a significant paper on it. This is meant to be ORIGINAL research on PRIMARY sources. No relying on random books you find in Baker/Berry this time - you need to develop your own ideas on your evidence. He says the paper should be 15-25 text, but mine was around 30, and after images and catalogs, 88 in total. I know people in that class who have similarly long projects. You do a 20-30min presentation on your topic (in western business attire!), and pray your classmates don't ask you any deep questions about it. The course is meant to prepare students for the Greece FSP, and it certainly does. For a non-classics major though, I would stay as far away as possible.\"",

Professor Stewart is extremely passionate and kind, and she is always willing to help of you make the effort to engage with her outside of class. Her lectures are engaging, and she is very knowledgable about anything related to antiquity. The class follows Roman history and the development of the Roman state from the founding of the city to Julius Caesar. Professor Stewart teaches a very advanced, in-depth, and nuanced understanding of Roman history, which is excellent if you are interested and can keep up. However, if that's not the case, I can see how the class could be a headache like some of the previous reviewers mentioned. That being said, she is a fair prof and course material is genuinely engaging if you take the time to consider it. Having some background knowledge of Roman history certainly helps as the pace is fast and discussion tended to be dominated by classics majors. Professor Stewart uses a new rubric for the course that she developed during covid. Assignments were essentially graded for completion, and the number of them you completed determined your grade range (ie an A, B, or C) while the quality of your work and participation determined the particular grade. To get an A, we had to write 4 creative papers where we had to write about some topic from the viewpoint of a Roman (1000 words each), write 12 paragraph responses to questions on various readings, take 3 quizzes until we got 100% on each, and write a 10 page min final research paper connecting something from ancient Rome to the modern day. This format worked well, and while it took the pressure off of worrying about grades, she was very particular in what she wanted in the writing assignments, especially the creative essays. For those we frequently had to submit revisions before we received credit for completion. Overall though the grading was fair if a bit strict. The readings were often dense and long, but that's to be expected for a history course. You could often get away with skimming them or skipping parts as she covered it all in lecture and did not cold call.\"",

On the chance that you're merely looking for a SOC distributive, or you're a history major/minor simply looking for a pre-1700/pre-1800 credit (my reason for taking the course), if you're not really that interested in the Roman Republic, do NOT take this class. No matter how good a lecturer Stewart is, she can't make the material interesting if there's no part of you that's interested in ancient history, and you will hate yourself with the sheer amount of work there is. Likewise, there's also a pretty huge difference between studying the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. Arguably the first half of the course is mythology since up until a certain point in the republic, there was an absence of much of any tangible or concrete evidence, so make sure you're okay with that. A couple of weeks in, I discovered that my interest in Rome was more the empire side of things, so I think CLST 18 would have been a better option for me. That being said, I'm still glad I took the course, and if you have any interest in the material, I would recommend it. Stewart is a fantastic lecturer, though a tad disorganized. The grading is fine. It's based on the number of reading response and creative writing assignments you complete, plus a final paper and three quizzes you have to take and retake to perfection (super annoying). Technically everything is graded for completion, but she factors the quality of your work in determining the final score. The final was very rewarding since you get to pick a topic of your interest, but the amount of reading responses and creative assignments you needed to do meant there was a LOT of work. There were times we had 100+ pages to read for each class, though you could get by with sometimes skimming/not doing them. Don't take this class with other time consuming classes - there were multiple times I stayed in the library past 4 and 5 AM finishing creative essays during busy times for other classes. However, Stewart undoubtedly rewards hard work. Mathematically, you can guarantee yourself an A- by just doing all the required assignments, and if she senses exceptional effort will give an A. We didn't get a full breakdown of grades to see how many A's she gave out, but we had an A- median. My advice - get a lot of the grunt work (reading responses and creative essays) done early, and put in a lot of effort on them. That plus active class participation will reflect well on you as a student, bode well for your grade, and give you more time for your final.\"",

The lectures inspired many students to think deeply about things that had nothing to do with class - like the blackboard, the fly corpses on the ceiling, what's for lunch, their D-plan, future spouses,etc. I, for one, could never pay attention. Stewart fails the coherence test, because she tends to leap from place to place without establishing the first place as a point of departure. The essay prompts were poorly done, as well.

The exam questions and essay prompt were straightforward and wouldn't usually require any sort of deep reading. As other reviews say, Christesen is a great professor who makes the material really interesting and makes the class engaging for the whole term.

For ten painful weeks, you will want to run home crying to mama. But if you can lower shoulder and tough it out, Christensen will make you faster, smarter, wiser, and better. He will bring out a level of perseverence and academic toughness that you didn't know you had. Don't think one class can do all that? You ain't had this one. Workload is the deciding factor. You will be reading 30 - 50 pages and writing a 2 - 4 page paper EVERY DAY OF CLASS. And he uses all x-hours. That's right: 200 pages of reading and 16 pages of papers every week. I won't lie. While taking this course, I pulled 2-3 all-nighters every week. I simply slept on the weekends and on Wednesday night, the only days I didn't have an essay due the next day. It might not be so bad for those who are in fewer activities, but it will still be a challenge unlike any you've had before. Here's the good part. Christensen is the best professor on this campus. He is hilarious in lecture every day, bringing potentially boring subjects to life. He reads and thoroughly grades every essay...quite a task, considering the sheer volume of papers that wind up on his desk daily. Christensen loves lively classroom discussion, and that perhaps the best part of this course. He WILL make you talk, so if you'd rather not speak up frequently, this class is not for you. But if you love a good discussion, you're in for a great ride. Say something stupid, and Christensen will make you look stupider. Say something controversial, and he'll make you back it up. Christensen does it all in a hilarious and not-too-serious fashion, and he's sensitive to those who need a bit longer to develop their arguments. In all, he won't embarass you totally, but be prepared to become comedic fodder. Overall, Christensen makes the course. It's hard to convey here why he is so amazing, but suffice it to say that, if you think you can handle it, this course is an academic and personal experience that you don't want to miss.\"",

Professor Christesen is extremely smart and a bit intimidating but cares more about his students than any other professor I have met so far. He actually forced us to all meet him in office hours and spent about an hour talking to me about myself before we addressed the subject material. He pushes students extremely hard and assesses them based on the quality of their work, not their effort which can be quite brutal sometimes. I definitely thought that meeting the professor and bonding with the class (usually through shared misery at the workload) was definitely worth the effort it took. I would definitely recommend taking easier classes at the same time, however, or I don't think you will be very happy. The class has a paper due every class which usually ended up being 3-5 pages double or 1.5 spaced. This was based on a packet of reading from blackboard, so my Greenprint account certainly suffered. There were also four group projects, which were essentially just longer papers; and a midterm and a final, which he preferred to be oral presentations. The other main component of the class was a paper that we revised twice that he expected to end up being \"perfect.\" The workload eased up in the last half of the course, which was a relief. He is relatively strict about attendance and timeliness for handing in work. Classtime consisted largely of analytical discussion of the course material, so it was hard to hide if you didn't comprehensively do the reading. Overall, this was a great class that I would recommend to everyone, as long as they are prepared for what they are going into.\""

The professor really, really makes the course AMAZING. He does just as much work as you for the class - and it really shows. But those of you reading about Christesen but not taking CLST 14, don't worry - he specifically says that this course he intentionally teaches with tons of work - his other courses don't have that feature. Prof. Christesen assigned an essay (about 2 pages) along with about 60 pages of reading every night. Plus there was an in-class quiz on factual material almost every class. The only other piece of work we had was to write one 6-page essay - and, like the real world, to revise it multiple times until it's actually perfect. Christesen guides you on the way to making a perfect essay, and does a fantastic job of it. He writes at least a 1-page, single-spaced review of your paper for each and every revision. He sent out an e-mail to the class at the end of the term which I think is very telling about his philosophy and how he teaches this class: \"I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I enjoyed working with all of you this fall. Dartmouth is blessed with some of the talented students in the country and almost limitless resources of every kind. However, all too often we end up being focused on getting by and getting finished rather than aspiring to do the best we possibly can. I find that phenomenon deeply troubling, not least because it is one thing for us to say that Dartmouth is a great educational institution and another thing entirely to put in the effort to make that true. The former is not a substitute for the latter. When I teach ancient Greek history I try to set the highest possible standard, both for myself and for my students. I do this because I believe that it is our obligation to try to truly excel, at least some of the time, and because I have immense confidence in the abilities of my students and an abiding faith that they are, when challenged, capable of being extraordinary. Both individually and as a group you lived up to and frequently exceeded my very high expectations. I am immensely proud of how hard you worked and the level at which you performed, and I hope that you are as well. You represent the very best of what Dartmouth can and should be.\"\"",

You'll write two medium-length papers, and rewrite them exhaustively. You'll also take a midterm, and a final. The result is that you will know your stuff.

That said, unless you can read Herodotus in 4 hours like another kid in my class claimed to have done, do not take this class. There is an essay due and a quiz to take every class. Essays can be as long or as short as it takes to answer the question completely, but mine were generally 3-5 pages and were based on the 100 pages of textbook and primary source reading materials assigned. Christesen uses all of his x-hours and isn't particularly understanding if you don't complete one of his 40 or so assignments on time. There is a midterm, a final, and two major research papers in addition to the daily assignments. He grades the daily assignments pretty leniently, but not nearly as much so on the finals or research papers. I wouldn't take this class unless you're planning on only taking two in one term.

Our reading material, which included discourses from a pagan philosopher, propaganda by a Christian Bishop and a secondary source about the Life of Constantine forced me to look at texts in a new way, scanning them for arguments and the points used to support them. There are two 3 two page papers, 1 four page paper and a final research paper. With each one, I felt that my writing improved. Professor Gaposchkin is an awesome professor who is really into group discussion. She really cares about making sure that everyone's opinion is expressed. Her class is demanding, but she's willing to extend a hand and guide you along the way.\"",

The work is tough and comes in quantity, but the result is you learn a lot and enjoy the class. Your grade is based off in class participation type stuff (i think 1/3 of it), and the other (2/3) is based on your papers. That means be prepared to write at a high level, and bring your A game to class, but you can take a day off, not do the reading and chill. Expect slightly low grades at the start, which rise as the course goes on.\"",

Professor Gaposchkin has a way of teaching that seems warm and engaging to the whole class, and she seems like the type of teacher who will put in all the effort necessary to ensure that her students understand the material. This is not an easy, just to fulfill requirements, class, however. Although I liked her a lot, from talking to other students, I could tell that she did play favorites in grading and gave some people grades much higher than their paper average while others significantly lower.

If only I had done that for all the other papers. Gaposchkin also really cares about her students. Most of my meetings with her would end with us just talking about classes, school, etc. She's very aware of the fact that the class is about \"esoterica\", but she still tries to put it into the greater context of history so you can understand the big picture.

I'm disappointed because after taking this class and doing lots of very dry reading, I feel like I still don't really know much about Greek philosophy.

The reading list is basically the definition of classic - Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid, Metamorphoses - with the black sheep of \"The Argonautica\" thrown in there to mix things up. Excellent lectures aside, you really should just take the course to make sure you read these texts before you graduate, because you know you're not going to do it on your own.

While he may advocate trying to toss out new ideas in said exams, he seems truly reluctant to hand out a solid \"A\", despite giving you a week in advance (or so) to prepare for each test with the exact prompt you'll be tested on. The final, however, was tragic. Instead of testing our grasp of the material in a broader sense, like connecting parallel themes between all the books in essay form, he requires that we memorize several hundred obscure names from the books and know exactly who they are. He granted us a boon by making it multiple choice, but still - I've already forgotten 3/4 of the names 3 days post-exam. What purpose does that serve in the long run? Exactly. NOTHING. Ok, maybe it'll get you a blue wedge in a Trivial Pursuit game, but honestly, that's a slim chance. Truly, that's my only gripe (albeit a big one) with this class.

The Iliad was my personal favorite and was the only book on the midterm, which is only about 2 1/2 weeks into the term. The main problem with the course is that it moves so fast. You have to read 100 pages of the texts for each class and so, you are always rushing through it, which is a shame. Professor Bradley is fantastic. He goes off on tangents fairly often (which are sometimes very funny) and needs to be reminded where he was, but you never feel that it is at the expense of the discussion.

The Odyssey and Aeneid are tested through in class essays which he gives you the topic for beforehand. The other two books are not tested separately, but are on the final, which is cumulative, but strictly charater identification (There will be close to 300 names to know, so stay on top of them).

            "review 30: \"04F with Edward Bradley: Before taking this class, I had heard amazing things about Prof. Bradley, particularly from the course review site and freshman edition of The Dartmouth Review. Psyched to take this class since I've always wanted to read \"The Odyssey\" and was genuinely interested by the other poems being offered, such as \"The Iliad.\" I expected to be blown away and fascinated by the professor and his class, but in all honesty, he didn't really seem that impressive on the first day, or in general. Prof. Bradley is a nice, old-fashioned prof. that definitely loved what he does, and that is evident when he gives lecture. He makes a special effort on occasion in class to provide additional materials that complement the reading, which added a bit more flavor to the class. He also adds some anecdotes here and there, some historical and others personal, which are usually amusing. For the course we read (in order): Homer's \"The Iliad,\" Homer's \"The Odyssey,\" Apollonius of Rhodes' \"Jason and the Golden Fleece,\" Virgil's \"The Aeneid,\" and Ovid's \"Metamorphoses.\" We read them in their entireties with the exception of \"Metamorphoses,\" which we read the majority of. - \"The Odyssey\" was by far the best - it was witty, it had variety, a suitable amount of fighting, and was overall entertaining to read. - \"Metamorphoses\" is basically THE mythological compilation; most of the ancient Greek & Roman myths you've heard/read about are in that poem. It's generally entertaining with its many interesting stories. It's good for those who have trouble paying attention to the other poems. - \"The Illiad\" and \"The Aeneid\" definitely had their interesting parts, but were overall hard to pay attention to, as they'd often get a bit dry at times. All the fighting in \"The Illiad\" does get pretty repetitive. - \"Jason and the Golden Fleece\" was the shortest, but the hardest to pay attention to. Fortuantely the poem's barely focused in on the course. We read 40-70 pages in between each MWF session. Prof. Bradley gave lectures where the majority of the student interaction is often asking students plot-related questions from the previous night's reading. Participation always does help, but in general, preparing for class wasn't that hard and wasn't always that necessary. If you can't do a reading for one day, that's perfectly fine. Don't be afraid that he'll put you on the spot or anything like that. The tests were all fairly easy, so long as you prepared for them. For \"The Illiad,\" the test was half character identifcation, half essay. The essay consisted of the identication and elaboration of the significance of a particular (easily identifiable) quotation. For \"The Odyssey\" and \"The Aeneid,\" we wrote in-class open-book essays where the questions were given to us a few days in advance. Marginal notations in the books were permissible. \"Jason and the Golden Fleece\" and \"Metamorphoses\" did not have their own tests. The final is simply character identification from the poems we had read. While there were a LOT of names/places to study (I had a bit under 250), just allot yourself enough time to make a study sheet and memorization isn't that hard since the ID's don't ask for much. Don't be an idiot - read the books. While you can coast through the class on favored website's poem and character summaries, when it comes to final time, it's a LOT easier to study the names when they jog memories of when you read the books they were in. Class participation is recommended especially for those poems that you will have essays for, since he would probably test you on something he's referred to in class. He also often writes down characters/places on the board so that you have an idea what to know for the final, so that also helps. On the first day of class, Prof. Bradley said that being able reading the course's poems is aesthetically pleasing, and I completely agree with him. I am happy that I read the poems for the class. The course may not necessarily be fun, but it's definitely fulfilling. It also gets a LIT distrib. out of the way so that you don't even have to touch an extremely harder (but perhaps more interesting) English class.\"",

Class lectures are important too, though you can always bum notes off classmates during mid-term and final exam study sessions if you were absent/didn't pay attention. The required readings, in general, were pretty sweet. We started off with the Iliad and the Odyssey, then moved to some classical plays and lyrical poetry. Essays based on the readings were also assigned as homework. Getting a good grade in this class was pretty easy. Though there are some surprise pop quizzes, they covered bits of information based on the reading. Also, Prof. Graver offered extra credit points if we attended a Classics lecture of other people in the field and did a short write-up summarizing what the lecture was about. The exams were also straight-forward. A lot of it was reading-based: identification, short answer. Some of the essay questions were about major topics covered in class, though the essay prompts were pretty straight forward. All in all, great class and great prof. Prof. Graver is very passionate about Classics and responsive to students. On the downside, the readings and the lectures in class can get dull. But I really couldn't have asked for a better intro to Classics.\"",

Professor Chaudhuri is as close to a genius as I've come across at the college, and his lectures can sometimes be hard to comprehend, but listening to his critical analysis for two terms now has surely enriched my intellect and it is refreshing to be challenged when most other classes I take are sort of a breeze. He makes use of the Blackboard forum which can get annoying but is a really good way for the people in a midsize class to critically engage with each other.

The class grade comes from participation on the Blackboard discussion forum, a 2000 word paper and annotated bibliography, pop quizzes on the readings (that are literally three questions long), and five tests, one per epic. Watch out for the tests. They have 50 questions each and are very very detailed, asking you to recall little bits of trivia from a very large epic. I often felt like the tests weren't reflective of the lectures. However, the professor does seem to give a higher course grade in the end than your performance on these tests might reflect. I would recommend compiling study guides well in advance of the test, drawing from online resources (which the professor tells you can be used), class notes, and the commentaries and glossaries within the books themselves. If you are willing to put in the work and do all the reading, you will love this class. If not, then avoid.\"",

Only two 6-page papers, two 1-hour exams, and a few small assignments in between were required. Class discussions sometimes seemed a bit nebulous, but if you thoroughly read the material you'll be fine. Though it has its occasional shortcomings, I'd recommend this class, especially if you're unfamiliar with any of the above works.

Also, the pop quizzes are expecting memorization of really pedantic things like giving you a pot and expecting you to label everyone on it when it was shown briefly in a lecture a week ago.

The photo submissions and essay are super strictly graded, way harsher than they should be. The class was worth it for the distribs alone, but be careful of the positive reviews misleading you.\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with Roger Ulrich: I've taken several courses in the classics department (including another with Professor Ulrich) and found this one to be unexpectedly quite difficult, not because the content is particularly challenging to understand, but because it seems like Ulrich intentionally tried to lower the class median. The class was a 9L, so to reinforce attendance Ulrich gave in-class pop quizzes, each of which only had 3-4 questions (so if you happened to miss one question you'd already be down to a 75% or worse). If you knew what to look for you could google some of the answers, but some of them were pretty niche and hard to get. On top of that, the midterm and final exam were shockingly hard (they were on paper, in class, & asked really specific questions based on material only briefly covered in earlier classes). I studied for hours for the midterm and have a decent background in classics and still did not do well on the exams. Finally, Ulrich graded the final projects very subjectively. According to canvas, not a single person got a 100% on the final project (you were allowed to make whatever you wanted for the final project as long as you ran it by him for approval & it had some connection to course material), and the only comments he left on mine were about different artistic choices he wished I had made. To his credit, Professor Ulrich was very kind when I brought up my concerns with the course at the end of the term, and I do think he is a nice guy. But all in all, I had very high expectations for this course and ended up pretty disappointed.\"",

When you take that into account, the workload needed to get through this class is very, very low. Without doing the readings, there are three (3) assignments over the course of the whole term that aren't completed in class, two of which should take 20 minutes tops. The workload needed to get an A in this class is a different story, considering that the exams really mandate that you study hard to do well, and (as others have stated) that the photo submissions and essay are graded harshly.

I've heard many complain that Ulrich's lectures are boring. Not in the slightest. If anyone tells you that, they'd probably be bored by any classics course. The lectures were great fun. Ulrich has a dry, academic wit that will leaving smiling if not chuckling quite often. He likes to focus on the quirky, often sexual side of mythology. He once showed huge image on the powerpoint of a statue featuring Zeus (in swan-form) getting it on with Leda, located in some European museum. \"I couldn't resist,\" he says. After contemplating it for a while, he mutters, \"How you gonna explain that one to the kids?\" Classic. He also likes to show movies in class that show how mythology has influenced popular culture...Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Hercules,\" clips from \"Clash of the Titans,\" and even a Monty Python clip made it into the course. The tests were easy and actually fun to study for. Sort of felt like high school again (for those of us who went to bad public schools, anyway). They consisted almost entirely of factual questions... \"The son of Hermes and Aphrodite was... A. Both a man and a woman. B. A shepherd on the slopes of Mt. Ida C. Paris of Troy\" ...and text identification. You can usually get by without doing the readings, but I would advise at least skimming. Overall, a great course!

There is a midterm and a final - both of those are really easy, most of the questions are in the exam prep that she does, and there's an essay on the midterm and final that she gives you prompts for beforehand, so you can write your response and learn it, essentially.

That being said, the exams are very straightforward and Tell gives you possible essay questions in advance so you have a very good idea of what is going to be on both the midterm and the final. Tell is one of the nicest professors that I have met at Dartmouth. He is kind, entertaining, and always willing to talk to students outside of class. I went in to his office hours once to ask him a few questions about my final paper (which I ended up not doing) and the upcoming midterm, and we ended up just talking about the class for 45 minutes. He brings his dog to his office, and overall he's just a really really nice guy. The class is not a lot of work. We read about 16 plays (which seems like a lot, but they go very quickly). Some other students I've talked to didn't feel it necessary to even read the material or go to class, and I think they did just fine.

            "review 2: \"06S with James H.: Ok, after much suffering, I have finally figured this guy out, so for any of you taking ANY classes with him in the future please heed my advice. General: Tatum is a self-absorbed jackass with absolutely no interest in you as a person. He simply doesn't care. His lecture style is perhaps best described as rambling and vaguely incoherent. His one redeeming feature is that he is whip smart, and his textual analysis is superb and insightful. Here are a few things to avoid when taking a class with him: 1. Do NOT email him, bug him after class, or otherwise draw attention to yourself by eating in class, talking, sleeping, etc. He also hates laptops, so you may want to consider not bringing one or if you do have it, keep your eyes fixed on his...if he looks at you and you are looking at your screen he will assume you are checking blitz and will probably shout out something like that to the entire class. As for blitzes, do not send him a blitz unless it is well thought out, insightful, etc. Absolutely avoid sending him any questions that could be answered by someone else in class--such as scheduling, reading, basic questions about tests, essays, etc. Try to stop yourself from going to office hours to look at your papers---only do this if you do very poorly. Office hours, and people in general I suspect, irritate him. Its better to stay under the radar. Don't make the bear angry. If you choose to email him, be prepared to be flamed. 2. You must take a different approach on his essays than on those written for \"normal\" classes at Dartmouth. He wants you to be irreverent, funny, and loose. He hates conventional paper types and conventions. Try to loosen up, be funny and creative, and above all avoid making any grammatical errors or he will own you. He hates conclusions, he hates grandiloquent introductions, etc. If you are going to write a conventional paper, you had better make sure it is unassailable, or you will suffer. 3. Tatum's tests are much easier to handle than his papers. Basically you need to read over all your texts 2-3 times and get them down cold, as well as anything he has said about them at all in class--including things on his handouts. His exams are never as bad as his papers, and his personality, might lead you to believe they will be. Ignore this advice at your peril.\"",

He's an interesting guy- really dramatic. It made it hard to nod off in class. Don't bring your laptop to class-he will call you out for checking blitz and it's super awk.\""

The course was overall great: with the best and most interesting lectures I\u2019ve had at Dartmouth from Prof. Christesen. The course had a midterm and final which consisted of short answer and essay questions. To do well on such questions you had to do a inordinate amount of memorization of dates, places, people, and even latin names, which was quite frustrating. Christesen said the course would involve about 5-6 hours of work outside of class (just readings), which was on average accurate. For three weeks during the term we had no work at all. This year Christesen introduced Canvas worksheets that we were to complete after each reading. These were annoying because they were graded really harshly. Overall though, CLST 1 was great. The course covers many interesting cultural facets (e.g. hypergoods, sex) of ancient Greece and Rome and relates them to their corollaries in American cultural, inviting you to rethink your beliefs. This course really changes your views on big areas of life like sex and success. I came into the course as a libertarian startup-wannabe and left the course as a centrist utilitarian.

The readings really weren't too bad. Then came the midterm He gave us a study guide that he said would contain some of the questions on the test. It worked out to about 3/4 of the questions on the exam were questions o the study guide. The study guide wasn't that bad to fill out but it often seemed like the questions he picked for the exam that weren't on the study guide came from left field. In addition, we had to write an essay about Spartacus (which we had watched one night) beforehand and one monster of an essay in class. Advice: If you have a choice, never choose the question that says \"Tell me everything you know about...\" It should be worded, \"Tell me everything about...\" The grading on the test was pretty harsh too, he's not kidding when he says he is a tough grader.

About half of the test material was given to us on a study guide. Make sure to go back through the notes to see what readings he brings up.

Christesen devotes so much to his students, but the 160 person class prevents too much interaction and forces him to administer 2 massive exams that require days of preparation to do well on (even with weeks of studying he will kill you on the essays so don't take it personally). A few days of cramming might be rough if you have other exams around the same time, but other than that there are no other graded assignments (besides a few optional things in case you bomb the midterm). The homework readings aren't completely necessary because he goes over so much in class in great detail, but they are all extremely relevant and usually a very interesting combination of secondary and primary sources. Things from these will most certainly be tested so at some point before the exams make sure to go through them all. The course covers a variety of topics such as violence, women, and sex, and looks at those subjects in both ancient Greece and Rome. Christesen is a historian of ancient Greece, but gives equal billing to both cultures, as his goal for the course is really to force us to reflect on our own culture by looking back at the cultural norms and practices of others. While this may sound like BS, I can't express how effectively Christesen achieved this goal. This isn't your typical history course...sure you learn a ton of nitty gritty details about ancient Greece and Rome, but most of the students aren't classics majors, and Christesen knows this, and so the facts that we learn take a backseat to the underlying message. Any history major should certainly take this course, but any student with even an inkling of interest in antiquity would enjoy it...it will change your outlook on the world while giving you a firm grounding in ancient history I can't imagine having another lecture course at Dartmouth that accomplishes so much in an hour. Almost every class will start off with Christesen asking if there are any questions, and if someone starts it off, a very amusing discussion will most definitely take place...people were hesitant at first because of the huge class but by the end he had a ton of people talking, and the funniest moments were probably him making fun of the student assembly president. After discussion would follow an incredibly organized lecture that keeps you perpetually writing or typing to try to record the crazy amount of information coming out of Christesen's mouth. A powerpoint doesnt help with note taking because it usually just has pictures and quotes, so the constant note taking guarantees that you won't be bored and that time will fly by. This is a class that you can't and shouldn't miss, as lecture stuff is always tested but the things he talks about are extremely interesting. The one complaint I have about the class was the night-watching of Spartacus, which drags on and on....and on. Otherwise, this class is perfect...it doesn't require too much work to do well and is beyond interesting...I don't know what more you could possibly ask of a large lecture course.\"",

The phrase \"out to get you\" is thrown around too often around here and he has no ill will towards you, but the grading on the exams is borderline lunacy. The way that the essays were graded was seemingly arbitrary and insane. He gives no feedback on what you missed on the essay and there are just a series of vague markings all over the paper. And you know something's amiss when for the first day of the midterm, you know the question beforehand (you know 4, and he gives you two to choose one), you've written the answer out beforehand and memorized it, managed to write everything you wanted to put into the essay on the exam, and still manage to get less than half credit on the question. The grading appears to serve only the purpose of creating variance for the curve, but it goes too far and is downright chaotic and nonsensical. The class itself is enjoyable, though the readings are largely pointless and non-redundant with the lecture, so you need to go to class as opposed to just doing the readings to make up for missed time, since the reading don't give enough of the information that is in class.

If 'information regurgitation' classes are your thing, this class is right up your alley. If you're looking for something more substantial, look elsewhere. You will not learn any profound insightful truths from prof. Christesen. His 'profound truths' are really quite intuitive. For example, he kept harping on the fact that different cultures often use the past to justify the present. Unless your high school teachers did not point out countless examples of this in past history classes, you will not learn anything new or profound in this class. To take another example, he insisted that we do what makes us happy in life instead of the well-worn societally-approved path in life. I agree, but the fact that he needs to tell us this shows how much he underestimates the wisdom of the average Dartmouth student.

I would recommend this class to everyone--interesting and rewarding. Make sure to go to class--most of the material on the exams is presented in class rather than in the readings. It will be really hard on you if you don't go. Don't worry though, the lectures are really interesting. Also, for the long essay part of the test, make sure that the you put some time into the application part of the response (apply whatever to a modern day issue)--it counts for a big part of the exam grades.\"",

Sure, I'm going to pass this class, probably with a C, but there wasn't much I could have done differently to get a better grade. I went to most of the first half of the class and took notes. I filled out the study guide to the best of my ability. I wrote an essay on what I thought was important about the Parthenon. And I got my midterm back and felt like I had been raped. I stopped going to the class for the second half, collected most of the handouts and filled in the study guide thoroughly. I felt just as confident in my essay on the final exam as I had about my midterm, but that probably means that Christesen didn't agree with my philosophy on sex in Greece and Rome. Also, scheduling things during the evening is extremely inconvenient when you have a job and/or rehearsals every night of the week. He has \"Virtue Point Opportunities\" for extra credit that often involve attending events outside of class. He showed the film \"Spartacus\" one Tuesday night. I had to attend rush at my house that night. Too bad- I was still responsible for knowing the information on the midterm. Not that watching the movie helped me write my essay anyway- again, connecting Spartacus to \"what was going on in the US in the 1950s\" is a broad topic, and if you're not on the same wavelength as the professor, that's just too bad for you.

Professor Williamson's lectures were not particularly interesting. She is not a strong lecturer, and her material (Classical poetry and literature along with lots of gender identity bs) was not of great interest to me. In reviewing my notes for th final, I found that one of Rutter's lectures often took ten or twenty minutes to review, while Williamson's rarely took more than 5.
