Honestly, I stopped doing the readings after week 3 and still ended up with an A. All that really matters is that you participate in class and find a nice topic to write your two essays on. These essays can be on nearly anything and she lets you grade yourself on them!\""

            "review 1: \"21F with Coleen Fox: To begin, I entered this class very optimistic because Global Health is one of my desired fields of study at Dartmouth! The assessments in this class consisted of 2 Midterm Essays (8 total pages / 20%), Another Essay around week 6 (4 pages / 20%), A Global Health Forum Project due week 9 (20%), a Final Essay (5 pages / 25%), and Participation / Attendance (15%). The essay assessments for this class were graded rather rigorously; Professor Fox is looking for specifically cited informations from the readings, so be ready to prioritize those in your week to week studying. The Global Health Forum project was extremely fun and applicable to many spaces in global health academia, as Prof. Fox sets up the assignment like a Forum where groups of 3-4 people each make a poster on an emerging Global Health issue (with solutions) and publish it to the class to be assessed by peers and herself. I think a lot of students liked this assignment! Participation in class is simple as it is around a 50/50 lecture to small group discussion style classroom. Though this allowed us to chat about readings and also pick the professor's brain on the topics we are studying, it got a little boring, inarguably. Professor Fox, however, is a gem. Though she takes the class very seriously, she is extremely knowledgeable and researched in the field, and is open and caring to helping students who want to learn from this class. She also begins the class with a statement that she does not want students to gain any unnecessary stress from her course, and was understanding of extension request, from my experience. Though I would not necessarily call this class a layup, it is relatively easy to do well (get median i.e. A-), and with a little of time and demonstrated interest, an A is within reach! Definitely take this class with Prof. Fox especially if you are interested in Global Health!\""

I thought the content of this class was fascinating and very important, and the profs did a great job selecting material. I actually really looked forward to doing the readings and watching the assigned films each week, even though it was a very heavy workload throughout. Profs Gemunden and Spitta were always super fun in class, and did a great job of consolidating and explaining the content. However, I'm not sure if it was because of remote formatting, but I found the class a tad unorganized and the expectations very unclear. A big portion of the final grades were weekly responses to the readings, which should have been a grade booster, but the response was often posted the night before and without any notification during class or through email to let us know that it was open for that day and needed to be done. Also, the midterm and final essay had zero instructions. None of us had any idea if we should be focusing on the migration aspect of the class or critiquing the literary and film aspect of the class in our essays, and asking them during class didn't make it any clearer. I'm genuinely hoping the structure of this class gets better after covid, because the content was genuinely great to learn about.\""

However, even for a non-INTS minor, this is a great class just to get foundational knowledge of the state of international development today, and the progress (& lack thereof) that's been made throughout history. Fox is awesome. Her lectures are fast and the readings can be dense, but they don't feel overwhelming especially if you are interested in the material. Grades come from class participation (important to refer to readings/past concepts in contributions), one midterm (pretty straightforward but you HAVE to know the readings), your term-long SDG journal project, and a final essay. Definitely not a layup, but the work is engaging if you're interested in the material.\"",

We have sunThere are A LOT of readings (maybe 40-ish pages per class) and you have reference all or most of them in midterm and final essays. However, this is the first class where I've actually looked forward to the readings. My one recommendation is do all the readings when they're assigned and take notes so you can easily use them on the essays. For example, our midterm had many mini essays that each asked us to incorporate direct elements from multiple readings and the final asks us to consider almost everything we've learned in the class. We also have to make a blog journal about a specific development goal in a country, which I think it interesting but a lot of work. Professor Fox has high expectations but is understanding and a fair marker.\"",

Also, lectures were not very interesting and felt tiring (plus they aren't very relevant to the midterm/final). However, Professor Fox made her expectations very clear, and grading was fair throughout the course. Not to mention the fact that she was one of the most understanding profs given the online format. Take this class for sure.\""

The content is interesting, although some of the readings are quite long and dry. Professor Freidberg's lecturing style is not engaging really. You sit for an hour and listen to her talk. There is a midterm for this class that was graded pretty harshly (as are the rest of the assignments in this class) and is a big chunk of your grade. Then, there is a large final project, which you then write an essay for. After that, you still have a final essay to write. I did not find Professor Freidberg to be especially warm towards her students when they were asking for help, or at least it wasn't evident. Take this class if you're interested in international development and are willing to work hard and sit through tiring lectures.\"",

There are plenty of readings for each class, and although you can get away with not doing all of them the day of you will eventually need to at least skim through them in order to succeed in the midterm and final essay. Do pay close attention in class and in the readings of case studies. I found the content engaging due to personal interest, even with this Freidberg did not feel like the most open and warm Professor even in appointment office hours. Lectures were decent and there was a discussion or participation component each class. Very little feedback was given throughout the course as mentioned in previous reviews @ GEOG006. In the end, I did learn a lot especially about how to look and think about development projects, which I find very useful.\""

She's tough, but she will make you think about conflict in different way and she's super smart. You will learn and Hardy keeps it interesting. I also like the balance between lectures and group activities in this class.

Closed book remote midterms x2 and a final project/paper with a short paper mixed in. VERY heavy overlap with Gov 5 so plus if you're looking for something familiar, but also super repetitive.

Class makeup was: 25% Midterm 1 - all short answer, about 50 1-sentence responses in 50 mins. Super time pressed and very curved. 25% Midterm 2 - half short answer and 3 essay questions, far more reasonable. 30% Analytical Paper - about 3000 words, argumentative paper on any class-related topic that you were interested in 10% Short Paper - about 750 words, exposition-style news article on a topic related to class 10% Participation - easy to ace as long as you are engaged with readings Before each class, Wohlforth assigned readings for the topic of the day that could take between 1-2 hours to properly read and digest and gave a series of questions to think about. Occasionally there were posted lectures to view prior to class as well. In-class time was all discussion between students with Wohlforth occasionally contributing. This class really forced me to think about violence and international security in a way that I hadn't before. Could be repetitive if you've taken GOVT5, but still approached topics from a different lens.\"",

Definitely a dense amount of readings for each class, but I'd say you didn't need to read them all super thoroughly to be prepared. However, I'd recommend doing so because the midterms really depend on them. The midterms are the only thing I'd change about this class. There were so many essay questions within a short period of time, I didn't finish the first one and barely finished the second one. Midterms were open note but due to the time you really need to know the material. Even though I didn't do great on the first one though I still ended up with a decent grade. Wohlforth is great though, one of the best profs I've had at Dartmouth. Made the class really engaging and was always available for office hours and was really helpful with final papers. This class got me into the INTS minor so if you're interested in it I'd totally recommend, as long as you're willing to put in the time.\""
