He also sees through BS, and won\u2019t hesitate to call you out on it, so take the class seriously. Your grade is made up of two categories: deliverables and participation. During the term you write two stories, one of which you turn in a first draft for to be workshopped in class. Both stories are due at the end of the term. The other deliverable is commenting on discussion boards for classmates\u2019 short stories ahead of their workshop time. Do it on time and give actual helpful, specific feedback and you\u2019ll be fine. The rest of the grade is participation both in assigned reading discussions and in workshop discussions, so whenever you can meaningfully contribute to the conversation, do it. You can get away with not doing the reading (though the readings are really good so I would try to get them done) since discussions usually go off-topic anyway.\""

The assignments of the class were six prompts with no minimum or maximum (but generally around 2 pages) that could be revised and edited toward a final portfolio, in which student selected their best works and wrote a cover letter for them. There were also 2-3 short reading reaction assignments and 2 blog posts. The best part of the class was the structure, in which students read each other's work and received extensive feedback on two of their essays. In this way, the class was entirely focused on improving one's writing ability and was very enjoyable. Craig can be a little frazzled sometimes and never responds to emails, but he really pays attention to your writing and is always willing to give more feedback during office hours.

I also liked that she brought multiple accomplished authors to speak to us and discuss about writing/publishing; it was very helpful. Now, class: you write 500 words 5 days a week with an accountability partner in order to build consistency. I enjoyed this a lot, but many people slack off. Crouch is not harsh, so she does not press the matter. You also turn in two long-form short stories. Some students in class turned in short pieces (like 4 pages), but their prose was so beautiful that the length did not ultimately matter. Class discussion is interesting and consists of discussing novels/short stories and giving peer feedback. I would recommend contributing regularly in class; it might not seem like it matters, but Crouch takes note of who contributes and who does not. Finally, you turn in a craft paper on a literary tool; it's not very high stakes, but you should put in some effort. Overall, lovely class with a lovely professor. Median was an A.\""

Throughout the first two weeks of the term, you read through various different pilot episodes from popular shows such as Brooklyn Nine Nine, The Handmaid's Tale, Madmen, Fleabag, etc. and have open discussions about what you found interesting about certain techniques these scripts used during class. Eventually, you pitch your own television show to the class and spend the rest of the 7-8 weeks writing a Teaser, Act 1, Act 2 and Act 3 for your Pilot Episode. Once this part of the class begins, you spend most of class time going over different functions of a script and doing peer edits in class. Homework consists of reading tv scripts (first 2 weeks), writing your script, reading other people's scripts and doing revisions. The professor is super nice and tries really hard to make class engaging and fun. Although I wouldn't consider this class a complete layup, I was always stoked to go to her class. In the first two weeks, you can expect upwards of 100-150 script pages to read per week and then afterwards you'll spend most of your time trying to write your own script. There's deadlines once to twice a week to present your pages to the prof and your peer group. You'll also present your first draft of your script to the entire class which the class will critique in class for 20-30minutes. At the end of the term, you'll pitch your tv show again, make a \"Show Bible\", and hand in a final version of your script. That's basically it!

There were 5-10 minute breaks in the middle of each class (it was a 3A). A lot of the time, the professor would make a little time for writing in class, usually along with a prompt. Every week, we had to turn in one poem. We also had to meet with the professor one-on-one 2-3 times throughout the term. Our final assignments were a final exam (just to show we'd learned the terminology) and a final presentation (about a poetry book of our choice). It was pretty straightforward. Grading is almost entirely participation. If you show up, talk, and do all the assignments, you're probably going to be fine. Olzmann is really nice and understanding.

Each week consisted of several poems to read, and usually one heavier bit of writing (open academic letters, long-form articles, snippets of books). Every week we were given a poem prompt, spent the week on it, and the last 1.5 hours of class would be an open poetry workshop where everyone reads their poems and then has a seminar discussion about them. (We also had a midterm poetry review essay, and a fairly open final project about adapting a work we read in class.) Professor Bennett has a great way of pushing students to improve their poetry while also being very validating and kind about what students bring to class. We also have a mix of lecture/discussion about the week's readings. Like I said, I took this class for the distrib, but I was genuinely excited each week to come to class. Bennett also does a phenomenal job of creating a classroom culture where everyone is involved and excited. It was just a really cool experience, and I'm pretty sure all of my classmates would say the same thing.

But I absolutely loved this class. The course title is self-explanatory; it\u2019s basically an introduction to writing fiction. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve had experience writing fiction before. The class is a mix of upperclassmen and underclassmen who are all (mostly) interested in writing fiction. It makes the class dynamic pretty neat. Up until week six or so, the class is basically a repetition of reading 1~3 short stories for homework + discussing them in class. If you\u2019re really interested in the reading material for a certain day, you\u2019ll end up loving the discussion. If not, then it could be a little painful to sit through. You\u2019ll see Chee talking for nearly 2 hours on some days. He gives out great tips and suggestions that come from his experience as a writer, but I sometimes felt as if he was thinking as he was talking which often produced long, awkward moments of silence. The last few weeks of the class are workshops. All the students get to present their work to the rest of the class and get feedback. It\u2019s a nice opportunity to see how your story is received by people. The workload is light; because the whole purpose of the class is producing your own short story, you\u2019ll be turning in weekly assignments which are basically pieces of your story. You can get very creative here, and Chee gives wonderful feedback (a great mix of constructive criticism, thoughtful suggestions, and at times some well-earned praise). I\u2019m not sure if he was particularly blunt or imposing in any way. I just thought that it the type of feedback that a published writer like Chee would give. He does suggest some stuff that you might be a little meh about, but he never forces his opinion on you. In the end, he wants to see what you can come up with. That being said, Chee could appear to be scary at first. But once you get to know him personally (by scheduling one-on-one meetings with him, etc.), you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s the best. He\u2019s also incredibly lenient and flexible with deadlines and is perfectly understanding that inevitable circumstances do pop up. He wants to make sure that you get the time and room to put good effort into your work, so he doesn\u2019t mind if you turn in assignments a couple days late (no points deducted). Participate in class, show your effort, and give the impression that you\u2019re working hard. Chee will know if you do put in good work and give you an A. Great way to get a ART distrib.\"",
            "review 2: \"20F with Alexander Chee: Incredible writer and prof, definitely reflected in this class. Went into it with a faint interest in fiction, came out with a much greater appreciation for the process and craft. Chee really cares about his students and will put in the time to make sure you are where you want to be. Readings and discussions can be dry if they aren't of your interest, but overall you pick up some incredible tips on becoming a better writer. Highly recommend for a distrib or even if you are just interested in writing.\"",
            "review 3: \"18F with Alexander Chee: Take this class if you like English or writing and need an art distrib. Workload is super light - easy weekly free write exercises at the beginning and readings for each class and then one long final short story. participation counts a lot, so speak up and do the readings. I would say it is easy to get an A (esp compared to other classes), but not a given. Chee is interesting. He's a smart guy and knows a lot about writing and different authors, but he's a very blunt guy. Not shy about telling you your story is trash and doesn't like when you disagree with him. I liked the readings and it was refreshing to have so much freedom with writing assignments.\""

            "review 1: \"22W with Peter Orner: AMAZING CLASS, AMAZING PROF. Orner is incredibly kind, fun to talk to, and genuinely cares about not only his student's success, but their experience and comfort with the class and the assignments. It's a fair amount of work, though they're fun and engaging assignments, so I never felt overwhelmed and was always excited to do homework for this class. Your grade primarily comes from the effort you put in to your work and class discussions, so if you're thoughtful and engaged, you'll get an A even if you don't consider yourself much of a writer. Can't recommend this class and this prof enough!\"",
            "review 2: \"21S with Peter Orner: I LOVED THIS CLASS. It was so much fun and Prof. Orner is great. I'm doing the creative writing concentration, but I'd highly recommend this class to anyone looking for an ART distrib or interested in creative writing.\"",
            "review 3: \"18F with Peter Orner: Amazing class and amazing professor! He's a really interesting person, and his feedback strikes a good balance between helpful critique and encouragement. The workload is definitely manageable: two shorter writing exercises, two main stories, and a revised draft of one of the main stories for the final grade. The class is almost all discussion and workshop-- instead of lecturing at you, the prof has you learn and experiment with creative writing techniques from the stories you read. I found many of the stories quite enjoyable and the discussions pretty compelling. There's a ton of creative freedom in this class. No hard and fast rules you have to follow in your writing, and you don't have to make the changes suggested in the feedback if you don't want to (you can still get a good grade if the story works!). I can honestly say I've become a much better writer after taking this class. It's definitely inspired me to continue with creative writing in the future and in general look at things more ~creatively~. Take this class if you have even the slightest interest in creative writing! I'd take it over and over again if I could.\""

            "review 1: \"22X with William Craig: I took this class because I believed there would be little work required. That was the case when I took a different writing seminar course with Professor Craig. And I guess that assumption still technically was true---all you really have to hand in is two stories at the end of the term, with the stories themselves having no strict requirements. However, it's actually really fucking hard to write a good story. It seems that there's a thousand things to keep track of, and no matter how hard you try to edit, it's still just shit. I ended up spending way too much time revising my stories, only or them to still be bad. Also you spend way too much time peer workshopping other people's stories, which are equally as bad as yours and have nothing valuable to be learned from. In the end, I just gave up and I am now eating the NRO. Only take this class if you 1) are actually interested in writing fiction and 2) already are skilled in doing so.\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with William Craig: If you enjoy creative writing or feel like you have stories you want to tell, this is a decent class. You are given a great deal of freedom and can really write about almost whatever you like. However, it is very easy to get lost in that freedom as Craig masks his disorganization as \"being chill,\" and its pretty unclear what he actually wants you to do most of the time, so if you like structure, this is not the class for you. As for Craig specifically, he is not the best teacher, as he really only tells you where to go with your writing, but not how to get there, i.e. he is good at teaching the broad strokes but is really not good at teaching the finer points of craft and storytelling. Most of what you learn in this class comes from your own experimentation or in the weekly small workshops with other students. Those workshops are definitely the best part, and if you buy in you can actually make some pretty great relationships and learn a lot. Overall, this class is fine; it was nice to take it over the summer and definitely required less time commitment than any of the visual arts classes if you're just looking for the distrib.\"",
            "review 3: \"20X with William Craig: Took this class randomly, not a major or anything. Absolutely loved it. The workload, while minimal, was really involving - you weren't just writing things for the sake of writing. Prof. Craig is really helpful when it comes to suggestions on syntax, dialogue, and story progression. It's also a very engaging class, you'll typically do 2-3 workshops where you submit your own work for the rest of the class to review, and other classes, you'll be the one reviewing other students' work. Super open seminar style of course - it was great. Grading was also more than fair.\""
