I thoroughly enjoyed the public policy readings and guest lecture components of the class but the teamwork part was miserable at best.

            "review 2: \"22F with Bernard Avishai: I have mixed thoughts about this class but mostly positive. I think this was the first time it was run so I would imagine it will only get better as they iron out the details. You are paired with 5 other people for the whole term. At the start, you are given some concept (this term was an artificial spider web material) and your group comes up with a product using that concept. You then start developing a business plan, focusing on a new component (market analysis, patenting, cost breakdown, etc.) each week. Two members of your group present your whole business plan with this added component each week until the final week, when your entire group presents the completed pitch to a team of real venture capitalists. Accounting for the B+ median, these VCs assign your group a grade on your pitch which accounts for 50% of your final grade. This is the bulk of the work for the course, which mostly entails meeting once or twice per week with your group, doing research on the plan, making slides, and presenting if it's your turn that week. Bernie is a ruthless critic of the presentations and sometimes criticizes your presentation for arbitrary details, but overall I prefer a critical professor who gives you something to work on over one that just pats you on the back. The best part of this course is that it's far more useful than most Dartmouth courses. You learn what it's like to actually develop a business plan while also improving presentation and group work skills. The potential downside is that you are with the same group all term and their work determines half your grade. I liked my group and most people in the class seemed pretty smart and motivated, but this course could be a nightmare if you got stuck with a bad group. The other components of this course are a 1000-word opinion piece about how government can help small businesses (30%) and weekly discussion posts accompanying very short readings on the public policy side of entrepreneurship (20%). We also had some really cool guest speakers including Nassim Taleb. Overall, this course is probably about as much work as most other government courses. It's a really unique opportunity, but please don't join it if you like to slack on group projects.\""

It shows from day one; she has remarkable insight that goes beyond the readings assigned. I found Lind to be kind and thoughtful in class and during office hours. She gave extensive edits and feedback on first drafts which really helped ensure that the final draft was as good as could be. Also, she had multiple videos that went over different aspects of a paper. Lind is a fabulous writer, so she expects good writing, or, at least, effort. She tried to be available for discussions and had office hours which students could attend to get feedback on their work; they were incredibly helpful when I was struggling on my final paper. Now, workload: before every class reading, you have about 50 pages to read, then you're required to write responses to the readings. I think this was because Lind wanted us to learn to read and write academically. The readings are very interesting and are well-written, and Lind's own academic papers are clear standouts from the other readings (perhaps because she combines academic writing with a reader-facing style since she typically writes for The Atlantic and WaPo); I enjoyed them very much. To get a good grade, you have to put in the work and show interest. It's not a layup by any means, but you truly grow as a writer. Something you need to be aware of: Lind takes an understanding of the theoretical framework behind authoritarian politics literature and research very seriously; you should understand it. You also need to show thoughtful engagement with class material to ensure your participation grade does not suffer, but I'd also also advise against being the one person who hogs the ball and always has their hands open. All in all, excellent class with a great professor. I was considering dropping after week 5, but I am glad that I did not.

It was an enjoyable class for those interested in political science. My writing got better over the course of the term but it wasn't rewarded. The first drafts were usually worth double or more than the second drafts (10% for first, 5% for second) which is just an insane way to grade for a writing seminar. Some weeks focused very heavily on writing which was helpful and a nice break from the often technical readings. Each class will discuss the reading, but it is easy to contribute if you do them. Professor Jerit said this wasn't a methods-based class but the discussions were often on the methods and treatment rather than the findings and implications. The worst part was people who clearly didn't want to be in the class and just had the coldest takes like \"we're so polarized\" or \"the media is biased.\" Also, the grading had the lowest range ever. I read some of the most god awful, elementary-level papers that got like 86s and the highest grades were barely an A. So, it was relatively easy to get a B+ or A- but much harder for an A. She also had very few office hours and highly discouraged meeting with her for first drafts (again, insane when it's the majority of the grade).

I definitely agree. The median was an A-, and it was pretty easy to get that grade. That said, getting an A was nearly impossible. I got the highest grade in the class on multiple assignments and was well into the top quartile for the remainder. I barely got an A (a 94% in the class, but she rounds).

She runs the discussions really well, making sure to turn questions and ideas back to students to hear their thoughts and check the class's understanding. The topic of the class definitely produced some hot takes and out-of-pocket opinions, but Prof Jerit was really good at maintaining the openminded and curious atmosphere. Instead of just telling a student \"nope, you're wrong! or, Nope, we don't know that for sure\" she'd instead use a key phrase: \"Now that's an empirical question, wouldn't you say?\" at which point that revved-up student would usually realize that they were just speculating, and didn't have a solid basis of evidence for their point.

You basically learn about all the misconceptions in law/how law in the U.S is broken (from policing, trial practice, trial discovery, legal education, attitudes of judges and lawyers, the power of the courts in general), and it's a really good way to get a handle on parts of the law that nobody really tells you about. Rosenberg's readings are very well chosen, and he knows how to run a class and foster interesting decision. Workload isn't terrible either, two 5-7 page papers that require you to take a concept from the readings and do research on it (very social sciency), and one take home final in which you synthesize the readings from the course. Rosenberg adheres to the standard A- median for seminars too, which is nice. The one thing is while Rosenberg is a really nice guy and a good professor, he's very biased. He doesn't want you to go to law school, he really hates the system, and the course is heavily biased towards you thinking that way.

I didn't need another senior seminar to finish the major but I couldn't resist because the blurb sounded so enticing and thank goodness I took it. The class had a long waitlist so I thought I had no shot but none of the waitlist people showed up to the first class so when a person dropped it I miraculously got in- so don't be disheartened! The class is 100% discussion and 0 lecture as you would expect from a seminar like this, but the discussion was fascinating. There was a fair amount of reading but that's also to be expected and they truly are interesting--she had us all give honest feedback on which readings we liked the most/least and which we thought she should take off the syllabus so rest assured that she's actively working with students to make sure the texts are worthwhile. Honestly we were never tested on the readings so you don't have to read them in detail per se, but trust me you'll want to at least get a good grip on the argument and take note of your thoughts on it b/c if you don't have anything to say or add to the convo it'll be pretty obvious given how the class is 16ppl max, and most have very thoughtful opinions they're sharing. In other words you want to put in effort to match up to your peers. All in all this makes for a very intellectually stimulating class. I think we had to write a medium length midterm paper and a long research paper for the \"final\" on a topic of our choosing that relates in some way to the course. There's a lot of freedom yet she provides great guidance and makes you turn in a draft beforehand to save yourself from procrastinating too badly on it. We also signed up at the start of the term to be the \"presenter\" on one of the papers we'd read in the future and to be the \"discussant\" on another. That means you'd become an expert on the reading b/c you'd be very involved in that class' discussion as a leader of sorts, and you'd post a 5-10ish min presentation online for your peers to watch prior to class. (in retrospect these were VERY helpful near the end of the term when you really started just skimming the articles-- watching them gives you a grasp on what the important points and arguments are if you're pressed for time). Overall a good amount of work but not too much, great prof, you learn a lot, I could go on. Take this class!\"",

The readings were incredibly dense and boring, but you are expected to remember a lot of details from them. Most of the class is discussion, so you can kinda hide if you aren't super comfortable with a reading/if you didn't finish it, but participation is a pretty decent portion of your grade. I also may have just really had an issue with the people that were taking this class with me, as it seemed to me that a lot of them didn't take the time to consider the diversity of the United States, in racial factors, ethnicity, education, etc, etc, which really rubbed me the wrong way. That wasn't necessarily Powers' fault, but she also didn't do much of anything to correct it.

He does not hand out \"A\"s easily on those papers but he really pushes you to be a better writer and learn the material. I came into this course with very little knowledge of Andean or Latin American history or politics, and it gave me such a good overview of the region that I am now interested to take more classes in GOVT and LACS. Professor DeShazo is incredibly knowledgeable, as he is one of the rare profs who has ACTUAL REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE in the region, instead of sitting in a stuffy college office writing academic papers like most profs here. He served as a career officer in the U.S. Foreign Service, including serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. He has spent multiple years in each of the 5 countries the class covers (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia) as well as others such as Chile and Panama. He was constantly telling us stories of the time he met and worked with presidents, ministers, ambassadors, and other U.S. and Latin American officials. As such, his class really focuses on topical historical and political information that gives you a fantastic overview of the region as if you were a Foreign Service Officer assigned to serve there. The class comprises a mixture of interesting lectures, videos, and group discussion, and he asks every student to stay up to date and present information on news from a particular country in the region. The essays in his class are relatively short, as he does not appreciate long-winded academic writing. Each of the short papers are 3-pages max (double-spaced), and the final policy memo is an absolute max of 12 pages. He even complained that he couldn't make the final paper shorter because of the GOVT Department's writing requirements. But he said that he would prefer to read a really good 8-page memo rather than a mediocre 12-page one. I really appreciated this style, as it is much closer to short memos you would write in the State Department or another civil service position than the other academic writing assignments at this school. I cannot recommend this course enough. Even if you are only tangentially interested in GOVT or LACS, you will learn a lot about the region from someone with real-world experience and you will become a much better writer in the process.\""

ONLY drawback: mock trial kids with years of experience will take this course and you\u2019ll be held to the standard they set. Embrace the fact that you have a lot to learn and just ask a lot of questions!!!\"",
            "review 2: \"22X with Bruce Fredrickson: TAKE THIS COURSE. Seriously, I am a gov major and I took the course because I was highly recommended to and I tried desperately to get into it last year. The professor won't keep you up to date on your grade, and you will primarily be graded on your performance with mock trial, but if you try hard, pay attention (don't bring anything technological to take notes on in class PSA), and truly truly prepare for the cases, you will be in good shape. Take ample notes of phrasings and delivery- this course is the equivalent of an introductory law class that I sat in on later on -- It's the best class I've taken in my time at Dartmouth, and Professor Fredrickson is an excellent person to know and to keep in touch with after you graduate.\"",

I was worried going in with some of the negative comments I saw on this page, but I did not see any of those negative things occur during the term. Professor Fredrickson's course is certainly different than many course structures. There are no exams, there are no quizzes, and there is no official homework. However, if you are doing this class correctly, there is still a decent amount of work to be done. There are like five books for the course, and they are lengthy and complex. Additionally, you are constantly preparing arguments for mock court cases, giving you real insight into the court room. Professor Fredrickson also brings in real judges and lawyers to give you pointers on how to improve your arguments. Prof Fredrickson also gives you his contact info so you constantly have a resource if you want one. This course is great. I recommend it heavily.\"",

This means you can't expect the same pedagogical standards in other courses with seasoned academics (strong/coherent syllabus, regimented homework, etc). Instead, you really have to go in with an open mind and ABOVE ALL\u2013\u2013\u2013 PARTICIPATE! There are really no grades, and it's an A-/A median.

Even if you do everything he says will get you an A, if you are not one of his favorite students don't count on it.\"",
            "review 6: \"19X with Bruce Fredrickson: This class was absolutely amazing. It's by far the easiest class I've taken in my life, but unlike many other layups, it was fun to go to every time and you learn a lot! We had NO exams, quizzes, assignments, homework, literally nothing. It's a bit crazy. Your entire grade is \"participation\" but I'm not quite sure what he really bases this off of because most of us were just given As as long as you speak up in class and he knows you care.. it's incredible. Prof. Fredrickson is really talented (he won millions for his client in a case against the Library of Congress for sex discrimination I believe) and so kind-- multiple times during the term he brought in other talented lawyer friends of his and then treated us all to free dinner at the Salt Hill Pub with them! The beginning of the term is pretty dry because you read the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and things like that that you have to know if you're planning on becoming a lawyer, but they're extremely dense. You discuss them in class, but there's no test or quiz so I found that reading summaries posted online was much better. Don't let this scare you off because it's only for the first two weeks or so. After that, he splits you into two opposing counsel groups and for the rest of the term you read a case file and pretend to be the attorneys doing direct exams, cross exams, and opening/closing statements (or pretending to be the witness who is put on the stand). It's very experiential which is neat. You dress up in corporate attire when it's your turn to do a direct exam for instance, and the rest of the class is the \"jury.\" The class is very entertaining because every day different students are basically doing mock trial for you to watch. It's low stress and very fun. You get a lot of time on your feet which is cool even if you aren't planning on going to law school because lecture style classes can get old. The waitlist is often very long and it can be hard to get in, and he doesn't use email (he had a stroke a while back and email was one of the stressors that he cut out of his life) so you have to text him if you want to ask him something/plead to get in. The only complaint I have is that Prof. Fredrickson doesn't have a good sense of time and doesn't watch the clock so often our class would run 15-40 mins over the limit. Students would just get up and sneak out if they had to leave, but it can be a bit awkward. TAKE THIS CLASS it's a great sophomore summer class!\"",
            "review 7: \"19X with Bruce Fredrickson: Honestly, this is a super biased class. You have literally no formal assessment and therefore no way to know how you're doing until you get your final grade. Moreover, Prof. Fredrickson definitely plays favourites and having no idea how you're doing really compounds that issue. Whilst it's an interesting class and he's an interesting guy it put me off going to law school and there's a serious lack of structure or real formal teaching. It's like the prof is just there and you're supposed to learn from that.\"",
            "review 8: \"19X with Bruce Fredrickson: Although this class had little to no work (a nice thing during sophomore summer for sure), the lack of structure and ability to gauge your performance was not helpful at all and I often found myself frustrated and unfulfilled. At the beginning of the term, I had high expectations and hoped to gain clarity about possibly going to law school, but this class unfortunately did the the exact opposite. It's a good course for people who have no problem with a lot of public speaking and being put on the spot all the time with questions, but if you're not really into that (or good at it nonetheless), this class won't be incredibly enjoyable. It's definitely not for everyone. Unlike the previous review RAVING about this class, Intro to Law was probably one of my least favorite courses at Dartmouth. Oof. The only upside in my opinion is that the prof is incredibly kind and knowledgeable (he's a big time Washington DC attorney with a ton of experience).\""

She is truly an incredible discussion leader and rises above all of my other government professors in that department. Somehow she has the ability to steer a convo in the way that she planned when making the syllabus, but does it without talking much at all herself and masterfully helping us to get there on our own and commending us for doing so. She pre-recorded lectures in a couple themed chunks that she posted on canvas before the week began. We had to listen to all of them before our discussion group meeting on Thursday. The class was split into group A, B, and a group that never met over zoom and had their discussions on canvas boards (not sure how that went down tbh), with about 12 or so in each group. At first I was upset the lectures wouldn't be live over zoom but it ended up being a good thing because I could watch them all in one sitting if I wanted to (pro tip: I put them on 1.75 or even 2x speed which worked well for me), and of course no one likes sitting on zoom and showing your face for no reason when you could be in bed watching the lectures.

On the one hand, it's not really too much work until the end. You have one LARGE essay (9,000 words max) that you are working on throughout the entirety of the term. There are deadlines to have different sections of the paper done during the term before the final paper is due at the end. Then you also have to lead class on one day, which means studying the readings for that day, writing a quick summary of them, and presenting to the class on those readings. Other than that, it's not actually a lot of work. The readings are pretty long and repetitive but I skimmed almost everything and still did well in the course and on my participation grade. The paper is long but as long as you take it at a steady pace throughout the term it's not too bad. On the other hand, Professor Johnson does have a LOT of very nit-picky criteria, and she gives super detailed comments on word/grammar edits, even to the point of telling me to correctly format my citations with hanging indents. It's somewhat frustrating to have to conform the paper to her exact standards but in the end the comments were helpful and I don't think she graded down for small grammar edits as much as the other reviewers claim. The class can also get very repetitive at times, with multiple classes focusing on topics like whether foreign aid can lead to dictatorship or cause political violence. I don't think multiple classes were necessary on each of these topics, especially because Professor Johnson rarely gave the lectures herself, preferring to let the students give them. In my view, the course could have been condensed from 10 weeks to 6 weeks without much loss of material. I also wish the course focused a little more on development and foreign aid outside of Africa, which seems to be Professor Johnson's specialty. Overall, I learned a lot in this course, it wasn't too much work until the end, and I think she's a reasonably fair grader. However, there are definitely some drawbacks to be aware of.\"",

The only qualms I have about this class is that it can seem a little long when we get off-topic and that I personally felt burnt out by the weekly reflections because I was probably spending too much time on them. The exams were a different format than I was used to (limit to 10-15 word short answers), but I didn't do more poorly on them than I would have if they were normal exams, so it is just something to get used to. If you have the opportunity to take a class with Prof Nachlis, I'd highly encourage it.

The readings are long, but they are rarely redundant and almost all of the articles he presents to you say something different, engaging, new, and relevant (you should read to do well on his exams). He really wants you to learn. He sticks to the B+ median as all govt professors do, but he rewards improvement over the course of the term. This year we had a midterm W5 and a second \"midterm\" week 9 that was 1/3 cumulative and 2/3 material from the second half of the course. Because of that, we didn't have a final and there was no final paper. In addition to the readings (about 120 pgs/week) there were 7 weekly \"reflections\" (~3-4 pg papers) that you write about the readings. Obviously, this requires a lot of time out of class, but class itself was engaging, entertaining, and productive. You spend a lot of time in class talking about interesting current events related to law. If you are considering law school but can't decide if you would want to pursue it, this is one of the most impactful classes available for you at Dartmouth. Seriously, I cannot recommend this professor enough.\"",

He responds to emails quickly and is available for help during office hours. The class discussions were always interesting and engaging.

That being said, it is definitely a difficult course, but Prof. Nachlis does an incredible job keeping students engaged, interested, and excited about the material. The course readings and discussions speak to the real-life advantages and issues with the law, and also tie them to history & current events.

Was refreshing to have that in the gov department for once lol. Heavy focus on econ in this class rather than gov. I kept forgetting that it was a gov class and not just a standard econ theory class. As the other review says, if that's your thing, it's super interesting. It wasn't my thing at first, but by the end I was real interested.

On the other hand, the writing in this class is miserable. Lind advocates for a truly horrendous style that takes all creativity, expression, and intrigue out of writing. It becomes a boring, monotonous, impossible to win task. Her office hours are also terrible. She has very little availability and is cold, distant, and not remotely helpful. If you can figure out what she wants writing wise, you'll have no problem in the class, the problem is that this is a very difficult piece of information to divine. Finally, the reading load for this class is horrendous. Many of the JSTOR and academic journal articles are frankly useless and bland and her book is perhaps the most dense thing I've ever attempted to read.

Readings were varied in terms of subject and style\u2014a good mix of academic journal articles, newspaper opinion pieces, book chapters, etc. The reading was at times immense, but the occasional (announced-ahead-of-time) reading quizzes were quite fair, and discussions did not demand memorization or pure regurgitation of reading material. The three essay assignments invite creativity and reward interest in your topic. Professor Lind is clearly knowledgeable and genuinely nice; her interjections in class discussions made the class for me. While office hours are sometimes difficult to get, Lind gives extensive edits on all first drafts and ample time to implement them before submission of a final draft. In addition, she limits out-of-class readings to give you more time to write. Lind is an academic: she doesn't hand-hold students (she can be blunt) and she expects a dispassionate analytical writing style (as is used in the field). Her expectations can be vague at times, and her standards high, but she recognizes and rewards good writing. Her grading is fair, though she does not sit you down and tell you how to write to get an A. If you are a good writer and are interested in nationalism as a topic, you will go far. However, if you dread analytical writing or care little for prolonged (at times repetitive) discussion of nationalism, you may want to steer clear.\"",

Coincidentally, when it came time to grade, she suddenly had a ton of comments about what I should have done to make my paper good. Funny how she would never say anything in office hours.

The only thing I want to tell you in advance is that balancing an internship and doing two courses isn't always easy. I'm not trying to dissuade you from going on the FSP. In fact, I highly recommend that you go. I just think that it's important that you have a good sense of this FSP going in. Professor: Bafumi is the best. Workload: For this course, you have to write daily journal entries. Mine were somewhere between 3 to 5 sentences each and I usually BSed them at the last minute. You won't get a letter grade for this course, but it will still count toward the Gov major. The other two courses met once a week. For each class, you had to read a book. Most of these were really interesting and were seldom longer than 200 pages. By in large, you could also skim them. However, you can't skip them. Bafumi will know if you don't read consistently and will take that into account when he puts together your final grade. Additionally, there is a final paper for each class. One of the papers is a group assignment and the other is an individual assignment. I highly recommend not leaving these to the last minute. If you start on them by about week 5, and do a little bit whenever you have free time, you'll definitely be fine. If you meet all the basic requirements for the courses, you'll almost certainly get at least an A-. If you do a little more than what's expected of you, you'll probably get an A. Overall, I highly recommend doing this FSP.\""

One student presents each paper and one student serves as the \"discussant,\" coming with prepared questions to kick off the discussion (you only have to do each of these once a term). The remainder of your grade is participation and a research paper. Participation is a good chunk of the grade, so don't take this class if you don't tend to talk a lot/don't like seminars. The research paper is a ton of work, but a very fulfilling exercise. As grading goes, Friedman's standards are pretty high, but he gives super extensive feedback on your presentation, participation, and draft paper -- and he returns it all to you very quickly (unlike many GOVT professors). I would say it is fairly easy to do well in the class if you put in the work, especially if you've taken other international relations-related GOVT classes. In class, Friedman gives useful context for each reading/discussion -- he is clearly extremely knowledgeable and lays out the syllabus very intentionally. The course will give you a wide breadth of knowledge about America's foreign engagements. He warm calls and cares a fair bit about participation. He's also friendly, funny, and very available in office hours. I took this class sophomore summer, which was really fun since everyone knew each other.

        "Stephen Brooks": [
            "review 1: \"23S with Stephen Brooks: One of the best classes I have taken at Dartmouth, hands down. Do NOT listen to the first reviewer. Professor Brooks is incredibly knowledgeable about U.S. grand strategy and he has a clear opinion that he does not hide (he's a liberal hegemonist, or what he calls a strategy of \"deep engagement\") but he is not afraid to be challenged, and he even invites students to argue for the opposite side. Much of the class is a deep dive into the overarching debate of grand strategy, which is whether the U.S. should pursue a policy of hegemony or restraint, i.e. how involved should the U.S. be in the foreign affairs of Europe, the Asia/Pacific region, and the Middle East. Other aspects are then added into the mix, such as economics, international development and aid, terrorism, humanitarian interventions, climate change, and public health. Students have to think about how each of these issues affect their overall view of U.S. global involvement, and what our strategy should be when it comes to dealing with them. I learned a TON in this class, and the discussions we had were some of the highest-level and most interesting of my time at Dartmouth (I'm a graduating senior and a GOVT major). Here are a few more things I like about the class: - There was a lot of reading, but it was both extremely interesting and surprisingly manageable. He makes you read quite a few articles written by himself, Wohlforth, and Valentino, as well as Barry Posen and John Mearsheimer on the restraint side, but the rest of the readings are interesting articles from a wide range of authors, each with a different or unique view on the policy topic of the week. And he assigns all of his readings on a weekly basis instead of a class-by-class basis. This meant I could knock out all the readings for the week in a few hours over the weekend. - Professor Brooks rarely lectures. He will say a few words at the beginning of most classes to put the readings in context, but most of class time will either be discussions in small groups or large class discussions, where he will write down student ideas or draw large diagrams on the chalkboard. - There are no massive papers for this class like there are for other GOVT seminars. Our class was the first time he took out the final paper assignment. Instead, 50% of your grade comes from \"weekly response journals,\" where you write your impressions, reactions, and opinions about questions related to the readings for that week. Participation is 35% of your grade (and he REALLY wants you to be involved in class, talking multiple times per day), and a final GROUP policy project makes up the final 15% of the grade. This consists of working in a group of 4 to jointly write two op-ed style papers with a maximum length of 800 words each. My group was able to knock this project out in a single day. - The Tuesday class every week is almost entirely dedicated to small group discussions with a set of questions given out by Professor Brooks. If your group finishes your discussion quickly, you are allowed to leave early. - If the weather is particularly nice, Professor Brooks loves to teach the class and have discussions outside. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this class. A great (and not super stressful) seminar to finish out your GOVT major, or even just to take out of interest. I was intellectually challenged and learned a ton, and Professor Brooks is one of the sweetest people in the department. Take this man to Pine if you get the chance.\"",

I was hoping this class would consist of reading the facts or historical recounts and then having our own debates. Instead, we read foreign policy articles (see: which authors can shout their opinion the loudest) and our class time was filled with everyone stating their (usually uninformed) opinions. Such a shame - the class has so much potential. Do not recommend.\"",

You know all those PS theorists you read repeatedly (Mearsheimer and company)? Well, Brooks took ideas we came up with in class and posed our ideas in an email chain he maintains with some of the top IR theorists and they responded to our ideas. Pretty cool in a geeky sort of way. I hardly think it was an exercise in ego. If anything, he is going out of his way for his students. He doesn't have the knowledge to challenge his students? Haha ok. We did have our own debates, or as you call it \"everyone stating their (usually uninformed) opinions.\" Uh yea, that's what undergraduate classes are. Getting exposed to new material and trying to develop your thoughts on the subject through lively debate. I am excited to see where this other student goes in life. I didn't realize I was in the presence of an IR savant these past 10 weeks. Smarter than Brooks, more informed than everyone else in the class. Thank you for gracing us with your presence. Anyways, take the class, it's a good one, and Brooks is such a nice guy. He's also smart and stuff. Just look in his office, he has a library ladder for heaven's sake!\""

I'll start by saying I got an A- (the median) so this isn't out of a need from revenge. The topics we cover are interesting in an of themselves: the effects of negative advertising for campaigns, campaign finance regulation, how candidates invoke race etc. However, Prof. Brooks just completely mismanages this class (at least over zoom). It has so much potential so this is really disappointing. The readings are interesting (take notes, you'll need them later\u2014I'll explain soon), but you also have to go through what she calls a Hyperdeck before each class. It's essentially a powerpoint that a pre-teen obsessed with transitions would make. On some slides literally every letter would bounce its way in...ridiculous if you ask me. They're full of pictures graphs and videos. Not particularly helpful or interesting but oh well. The class over zoom itself always felt like a massive waste of time. You know those amazing govt profs who are incredible at leading discussion in a productive way? Yeah Brooks is v challenged at this. There were times when she'd ask us an obscure question once and then we'd take a second to think about it before raising our hand and she'd interpret that as \"we didn't read\" and \"we don't care about her class\" etc and call off the question after we've only had ~3 seconds to think it over. She's a very enthusiastic woman which is nice over zoom because she tries to really connect with us, but at the same time this means about half of the class is wasted by her rambling about nothing and we don't actually learn anything. She clearly picks favorites (I certainly wasn't her top fav, but she did like me so that really does help...I would recommend sucking up a bit given that her opinion of you goes a long way) so beware of that. We did have a couple neat speakers so that was enjoyable! The projects that we did were fun but also didn't really teach us much and it didn't appear that she factored them into our grade which was so strange. Our grade was almost entirely the weekly response journals that she had us turn in by Thurs 7pm. This is the best piece of advice I can give you: work VERY hard on those. I'm talking hours. minimum like 3 paragraphs per question. cite every single reading assigned for that week (unless you want to be docked points). Our entire grade was those response journals + final paper and maybe a bit of participation through the one group project she decided to care about, but she made them seem like completion grades so we didn't try that hard on the first ones. She took about 3 weeks to get us back week 1's journal so we also didn't know we weren't putting in adequate effort for a while. Last thing: multiple members in my class (including myself) literally cried as a result of mean emails from her. She can very very rude and condescending over email even if she likes you if you even give her an impression one day that you're grade grubbing or frustrated with her, so just take anything she says with a grain of salt! Overall the class wasn't horrible but we were all so done with her by the end.\""

            "review 1: \"24S with N Bruce Duthu: BEST CLASS AT DARTMOUTH! Professor Duthu is a fantastic lecturer is very knowledgeable about the topic of the course. His sheer experience in this field, as a lawyer and scholar of Indigenous history and legal rights, just demonstrates his knowledge and passion for this topic. Readings were dense, but Duthu does a great job at synthesizing information in class. Just be aware that he does cold-call, so just be sure that you know the basic facts of the cases that you talk about in a certain lecture. Overall, this course does a great job at explaining the complex world of Federal Indian Law, and is a great introduction to what classes in law school will be like for those that are interested. You are graded on a midterm, final, final paper, and participation. Midterm and final are in class, two essay questions: one open-ended essay question that asks you to synthesize information from a given passage, while using materials that we discussed in class. Second question is a hypothetical legal problem that asks you to use case precedent to explain the situation and your recommendations for/against legal action. Duthu walks you through each question before hand and thoroughly explains what he is looking for in an answer, so if you know the cases discussed in class and the general timeline of American Indian history, you will do just fine. Final is cumulative, but easy if you make an effort to study. Final paper is 3,500 words and based off any topic within the field of Indigenous law. Can, but does not have to apply to topics discussed in class. Highly, highly recommend this course to those that are interested in law school/Indigenous studies, or just want to take a very informative and interesting class.\"",
            "review 2: \"21S with N Bruce Duthu: I highly recommend this class. It's basically a law-school-esque crash course on federal Indian law. What that means is you spend virtually the whole course reading and discussing Supreme Court cases which have shaped the field. Your grade is made up almost entirely of two exams and a final research paper. The exams are traditional timed essay questions, one that asks you to synthesize material and one that has you apply legal principles to a new case problem. That aspect is unlike other gov exams I've taken, but Duthu gives you practice and advice. The research paper is pretty intense but not crazy, and the nice thing is that there's no busywork outside of class\u2014it's just reading cases and prepping for exams/writing the paper. Not an easy course, but definitely rewarding, and a really unique offering. Duthu is kind, brilliant, and fair; if you want to dabble in NAS or law, this is a good call. If not, there are definitely easier gov courses out there\"",

The grade is based on a research paper of a topic of your choosing and one midterm and a final, both of which are just two essay questions.

He has an admirable ability to explain complex concepts and decisions so that they are comprehensible to someone without training in law. The coursework is challenging every day. but the potential for learning makes it worth it. Some understanding of the history of the relationship between the United States government and Indian tribes, especially with regard to federal Indian policies, is very helpful. I would recommend developng some of this background knowledge before taking this course.

There is a lot of readings (it\u2019s a gov class, yet somehow I didn\u2019t realize what that meant lol) but you can probably get by skipping some of them. Grading is 3 3-page papers (30%), 1 group video project (10%), midterm (30%), participation (5%; entails quizzes and showing up to classes/events) and a final group paper (25%). The time you have to write the short papers is really tight on the schedule (if you follow it, you only have 48 hours) but two of the three papers ended up getting moved back so it was fine. Midterm is probably the hardest part of the course; yes it\u2019s online, but also it\u2019s super long with not that much time to do it. The final group paper was due really early (like before finals period starts) and also didn\u2019t really get moved back, which was rough. As for the teaching, each prof takes a third of the course. Irwin teaches the econ oriented positives of capitalism, Muirhead provides philosophical critiques against capitalism, and Wheelan provides a broad overview of public policy. Personally I thought Muirhead\u2019s bit was the most interesting; he provided a interesting framework to evaluate capitalism under. Wheelan\u2019s part of the course was too all over the place and didn\u2019t really address capitalism directly, and Irwin\u2019s part was literally just talking about abundance for two weeks. I was also disappointed that there wasn\u2019t more class discussion in the class (although I guess that\u2019s good if you just wanna chill.)

Class is kind of half lecture half discussion\u2014I found it engaging and thought-provoking, although I don't feel like I learned a ton of new information per se. That was probably in part because the class is co-taught by three professors; they're all brilliant rockstars, but things definitely got disjointed/disorganized from time to time. Still, they each knew how to lead discussions (although Muirhead could stand to let people finish their sentences), and hearing everyone's perspective on moral/economic/political issues was the highlight of the class. Most of the grade came from a written midterm and a big final project. Both were not hard to complete well if you put in time and effort, but both were graded pretty hard. There were two (maybe 3?) pop reading quizzes and a bunch of short responses, but if you do the readings they're easy to get full credit on. When it came down to it, grading was a little harder than expected, but I think a smart person who does the readings and puts in effort on the midterm and project can count on an A or at least an A-.\""

And the expectations for our \u201cjudicial opinions\u201d (essays where you judge a particular case in the voice of jurists you read) were a bit unclear. Grading is a bit hard. This class has been taught many years. The online modules were pre-made. The professor sometimes lost track of the calendar. And I feel like that made him not as in touch with how we were doing. I would still recommend James Murphy as a professor. Definitely a gem because of his expertise (Ancient Greek and medieval philosophy). This class this term was not particularly well-taught.\"",

Very easy to get a lot out of this course. Also, extremely minimal workload regarding assessments - but they were graded with rigor.\"",
            "review 3: \"19W with James Murphy: STAY AWAY. This is the advice I would give you for this class and for Murphy in general. The other two reviews for this term were right about class being chill and not having to do the readings for each class. They do not reflect the overall sentiment of our class after this term AT ALL though. Murphy is the most random grader you will ever meet. He's chill in the classroom but is insane when grading. He left comments on people's essays saying \"You will be on the Supreme Court Bench\" and gave them a B-. Another classic: \"You would make a wonderful lawyer\" accompanied by a B. He probably doesn't even read people's essays - there's close to no comments on them! He would start off telling everyone in their paper comments \"Wonderful Paper\" then would give B-s, B, and B+s to all. Extremely weird. And the highest grade he gives - period - is a 93 on every paper and essay. No one in the class got higher on any essay. You would assume that that means a 90+ is an A but no - the cutoff for an A is a 93 (you can get higher than a 93 on participation, attendance, and the daily blog posts). And don't think you'll be able to guess how he grades - it is extremely random. He gives people Bs and will leave almost no comments on their essays. People in the class were extremely frustrated with Murphy, so the other two reviews for this term were probably written by the two or three knuckleheads always sucking up to him in class. Be smart, and stay away from Murphy. He's a disaster, and so is this class.\"",

Murphy is a super nice guy, asks thought provoking questions, and has a quirky sense of humor. You can get by with just reading the lecture notes for class discussions. Attendance in this class is important if you want to do well on the paper's, which are graded very harshly. Murphy really knows what he's talking about though -- one of my favorite professors at Dartmouth.\"",

            "review 7: \"05F with James Murphy: Don't ever take this class. In fact, don't ever take a class taught by Professor James Murphy. He hardly qualifies as a professor in my view. His basic problem: the man cannot lecture effectively. I'm not really sure what drove me to attend nearly every class, but I greatly regretted it every time I went. I came into this class greatly interested in law and hoping to get a course that dealt with controversial legal issues with an eye towards political philosophy, but still a firm grip on the real world. Instead, I got a course where a man with a beard stood in front of an uninterested class (save for a few overachievers, but what class would be complete without them) and talked slowly and without clear design about legal philosophy, which seemed merely an excuse for him to show off his mastery of latin phrases used in the legal world. We covered Aquinas, Austin, Carter, and Fuller in great depth, but never seemed to go beyond talking about their philosophies. Other than a few in class debates, which only involved those who volunteered to present (these were the best part, especially because two of them were moderated by guest lecturers) and dealt with somewhat interesting situations, there was no discussion of application to current real world issues. You're probably looking for reviews on this course thinking, this would be a great course for law school...think again. You'll never find a class that's harder to stay awake in. As for the work, the readings got longer and longer as we went, although some were at least interesting (Fuller at least). By the second half of the course, it was evident that no one was really doing the readings at all. The largest reason was that Murphy DOES NOT INSPIRE ANY INTEREST in this subject, and I cannot stress that enough. He's enough to make you question why you would ever want to study law. The grading (other than class participation) was based on a midterm paper and a final paper. The midterm was 5 pages and based on our first debate case. There was only one choice and I can only describe the topic as uninspired. It also seemed that when the papers were returned about 4 days later with minimal comments and poor grades all around, that Murphy's grading effort was extremely uninspired. Afterwards, he emailed the class saying that we could write an additional paper to boost our grade, but the topic basically remained the same, just from a different perspective. From the indication of the final grade, doing this paper didn't actually improve my grade at all. Thanks a lot, Murphy. The final was 10 pages and again we had to represent the positions of philosophers we had studied on a certain case. This was slightly more thought out, but still not that impressive. All other political philosophy classes I've taken have always provided several choices for paper topics, but I guess those instructors actually care. When it came down to doing the paper, I just couldn't get intersted, which I suppose was a mircocosm of the whole class. Never take this, any other 60 level class is better. To describe this class in a quote from Lisa Simpson: \"Do you remember when you lost your passion for this line of work?\"\"",
            "review 8: \"05F with James Murphy: I walked into Jurisprudence having heard that it was a great class. However, the class turned out to be nothing like I had imagined. I was thoroughly disappointed with the fact that we discussed only philosophy about law and not important legal issues. We did have a few in-class debates, the highlight of the class, but these were few and far between and couldn't make up for all the other days spent wishing I had signed up for advanced organic chemistry instead. The readings were centered on the philosophies of Aquinas, Fuller, Carter, and Austin. Austin and Fuller were somewhat interesting but I feel that I was left with a knowledge of their thoughts and none of my own. Sure, its great to be able to take an educated guess as to what Aquinas would say on an issue of today, but I just don't feel that that is enough. This class seemed promising, but it failed to deliver. As for Professor Murphy, there is not much to be said. He seemed to command a knowledge of the subject and he seemed as if he genuinely wanted to be in the classroom. However, the lectures he gave were dry and sometimes painful to sit through. The clock never seemed to move. When swamped with 2 final papers (due the same day) and a final (which was on the day the papers were due) I requested one extra day for my final paper and was turned down without question. I realize that this class sounds like a good step towards law school, but if this was an indication of what law school is like then I would be forced to seriously reconsider that path. I was completely turned off by this class and hope I can spare someone else my pain.\"",
            "review 9: \"05F with James Murphy: Jurisprudence is a fascinating subject, and Professor Murphy managed to suck the life out of it very quickly. There are so many directions we could have gone in, and the only thing that happened was that I had to fight to stay awake in virtually every class I attended. Papers offered a brief moment of hope - they were relatively interesting to write and were usually set in a fun format. Grading on the papers, however, is completely arbitrary and usually based on how much Professor Murphy likes you. He returns a classful of ten page papers in about two days, which almost guarantees that he barely reads them (there are NO comments on them, just a grade at the end). Murphy is a terrible, boring professor who means well but just ends up being awful.\"",
            "review 10: \"02S with James Murphy: I really liked this class...the professor had a lot of class discussion and debates, and the topics were really interesting. The reading started piling up near the end, and while there were no papers, the midterm and final were both 10 page single spaced take-homes that took a lot of time. But I'd definitely recommend it if you are interested in the philosophy of law. Murphy tried really hard to make it interesting.\"",
            "review 11: \"02S with James Murphy: The class is a great class to take and very interesting whether you are a major or not. Lectures were interesting for the most part, but were sometimes difficult to follow. The midterm and final were very difficult and time consuming and if you don't have the readings done ahead of time they will make you miserable.\"",
            "review 12: \"02S with James Murphy: From the course description, I was really looking forward to the class, but Murphy totally killed the entire subject of jurisprudence. The readings were skewed to highlight Murphy's own views, and the midterm and final exams were extremely long and tedious.\"",
            "review 13: \"02S with James Murphy: Admittedly a dry subject, but lectures were not at all engaging. The occasional student debates over case studies were the only highlights of the course.\"",
            "review 14: \"02S with James Murphy: While both the reading and subject matter of this class were interesting on their own, Prof. Murphy did nothing to inspire passion for the material. He lectures for the most part with his head down, reading from his prepared notes. Otherwise, he asks blatantly obvious questions that no one cares to answer, allowing minutes of dead air to go by, as student shift uncomfortably in their seats. In addition to miserable lectures, Prof. Murphy is by far the laziest grader I have ever had. The graded components of the class consisted of two 10 page SINGLE SPACED take homes, which Murphy returned to a class of over thirty students in about a week. How did he get them back so fast, you may ask? Easy, he didn't write any comments on them, or offer any feedback, he simply slapped down numbers. I must assume he wanted single spaced only so that his little fingers wouldn't get tired turning pages. Anyway, if Murphy is still teaching it, I'd recommend you stay away from this class, and from Murphy in general.\"",

The material was dense but pulsated with the vitality of deep thought. Professor Edlin is also an incredible professor. Each class lecture was meticulously organized - every element of the reading was explored and explained - so even if you didn't understand it when you read it, you would after his explanation. He took questions throughout, and opened the latter half of most classes to discussion which proved insightful and entertaining. Prof Edlin was accessible outside of class as well.\"",

            "review 3: \"03F with Douglas E.: First of all, I have nothing but positive things to say about Professor Edlin, who is encouraging, intellectually cautious and impartial, and so helpful it's obscene. I've only had two profs this excited about helping students and willing to go wayyyy beyond the call of duty to commit hours upon hours to helping your stupid ass figure out what is so easy for him (the other prof, btw, is Farid in comp sci, and he's amazing and hot, too). One irritating factor is that he appears to be anti-A in that it's practically impossible to get even an A-, at least on in-class assignments. A B+ to him is excellent. But don't let that discourage you- even though my work would have been a plain A in any other course, and I'll probably get a B+ here, I'm so happy I took it. The course is refreshingly organized, with relevant readings for every class, something that is decidedly not true with other gov profs. Of course, the subject in general is a little dry, but if you're a gov major at all interested in philosophy, you'll love it. Admittedly, this is a biased review. I have an intense intellectual crush on the man for his genuine devotion to feminism and his endearing yet infuriating complete inability to dress himself. Of all the professors I've had mind sex with, he's the best, even if he had no idea.\"",
            "review 4: \"03F with Douglas E.: Jurisprudence is a fancy name for legal theory, not that it describes the class very well. Calling the reading dry is an understatement- after a couple of pages you'll either forget everything that was said or fall asleep. However, this course had two redeeming qualities. First, the material was theoretically interesting, and at a more macro level, the topics we studied were fairly complex issues that allowed for discussion. Second, Professor Edlin is great. Without him teaching this class, I wouldn't have lasted a week. He is a master at explaining even the most banal material, and he really does cater to his students in his interactive teaching style. However, as with most classes the papers and exams thorougly tested the material, and dissecting the theories gave me a headache. Take this course if you want; at the very least, you'll get a preview of law school. At best, you'll gain an appreciation for the finer points of legal theory.\"",
            "review 5: \"03F with Douglas E.: Edlin may be the prime example of a professor who really hesitates to cross student grades from the B+ to A- range (he makes an announcement that a B+ is an excellent grade in his class, despite what others may think), but any hesitations you may have should be heavily outweighed by taking a class from this professor. While the readings are very dense, sometime repetitive and difficult to understand, the professor will spend any number of hours necessary to make sure you understand the material...if you seek him out. He spells out the material in class, but you won't understand the full extent of the reading concepts unless you do the reading too (and you won't get an A w/o reading yourself). It can't be stressed enough that the professor is amazing. His calm tone (almost to the point of lacking inflection) may be a drawback on the first day, but you get past that and end up loving the prof. He's much more patient and straightforward than other profs in the dept. Participate in class...you'll enjoy it more when debating. However, studying legal theory can feel pretentious, and sometimes leave you feeling like you're sitting high in the ivory tower.\""

I would highly recommend this course. It is a good amount of reading, but the readings are interesting and provide you the opportunity to think about your opinions to controversial issues. I still enjoyed this course a lot over Zoom. I thought that Swaine was able to make the most of the online features through break out rooms and class discussions. I think this class is definitely still worth taking on Zoom. Structure of the class was before class pre-recorded lectures and readings (around 50-75 pages max) and discussions during class. We had 1 written midterm (open-book, open-note), 1 written final (open-book, open-note), and 1 8 page paper. Be prepared to discuss with peers about very controversial topics (immigration, abortion, torture, etc.). While it was uncomfortable at first, the other students were always very respectful of differing opinions and Swaine was good at moderating the discussion. It felt like a safe environment to talk about these sensitive topics. This is a great class to learn a lot, get outside your comfort zone, and take a class with a wonderful professor.

Professor Swaine is politically neutral and our class both (i) \"ran the gamut\" in terms of political ideology and (ii) respected ALL of each other's ideas, even on very controversial issues. As a conservative, I was worried this class would be one-sided or an \"echo chamber\" but I was proven very wrong. Currently, I have a great sense of various perspectives on these difficult issues and (more importantly) of my own opinion on each issue. It is literally an objective of the class to develop our own political opinion on moral issues that often require more than just hard evidence (they require your moral, normative beliefs to be incorporated).

            "review 12: \"07F with Brent Strathman: As a soon-to-be-declared ENGS major, I'm not sure why I took this course in the first place. Regardless, though, the class was definitely one of the best ones I've taken up to this point at Dartmouth. The curriculum revolves around lectures and discussions involving four models of decision-making. We had one written in-class final, one five to ten page paper, as well as an end-of-class simulation. The lectures are pretty interesting, and the discussions require participation. The simulation, however, is the highlight of the class. Students are divided into groups of one to four, taking on roles as the governments of a variety of different countries. During the three-day simulation, they must sign treaties and agreements, negotiate towards goals, root out spies and terrorists, and basically do a whole lot more. It ends up becoming extremely engrossing- you may not get very much sleep at all during the simulation, and most of your classmates will be in the same situation. Strathman is a great professor. He is passionate about the material, relates well to students, and is very accessible. He also likes video games a lot (we even caught a glimpse of Kotaku once upon his screen). If you don't take this particular class, at least consider finding another Strathman class. Overall, this is a relatively easy, interesting class taught by a gifted and passionate prof. Take it to fulfill your government major requirements! Take it to fill your distributives! Take it to crush your friends in the simulation! Highly recommended.\"",

For the final model there is no book so instead you read several articles. Each model is introduced in a lecture, critiqued in a lecture, then you read a case study where you examine how the model applies to the situation. There is a short simulation for one of the models, then you take a midterm after all four models have been introduced. The midterm is fair and not too difficult if you've done the reading and paid attention in class. After the midterm, you have a simulation. This is the best part of the class--you have a week for it and it's really intense but a ton of fun. There's a 5-10 page paper due at the end of class that asks you to use the models to analyze the Iraq War. Overall, a great class and Strathman is fantastic.

He's kinda dorky (some in-class examples he gives involve his mania - video games), but veyr interesting to listen to, with a good sense of humor.

He assigns every student to a particular role in a country (i.e. President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense) - about 2-3 students per country. Then he makes you formulate realistic goals for you country and lets you interact with each other, negotiate, sign treaties, etc. Everyone can communicate with all other actors, there's also assigned terrorists and spies. Apparently, this simulation was used by the CIA in training. It lasts three days of class, and it was so engaging, that all 40 people in the class barely slept during those days, trying to get the upper hand on negotiations through espionage and stuff like that.

Lind spent a lot of time in lecture explaining pretty simple concepts and didn't bring in a ton of new information or anecdotes to liven things up.

If you enjoyed Govt 5 and want to apply the theories you learned with Lind, Press, Brooks, or Wohlforth to some real world scenarios, then I'd also recommend taking this class. Professor: Prof. Lind was sometimes a bit scatterbrained, and though her lectures were organized, they usually consisted of her asking the class questions. Sometimes this worked well, but other times it made her lectures less effective. Also, the IDs on her exams were sometimes a bit frustrating. She would give you a term and then expect you to define it in only two sentences. After the first exam I realized that the best way to accomplish this was to state how the term (a) related to East Asia and (b) related IR concepts or IR theory. If you do both of those things, you should be fine. Other than that, she was a good professor. Workload: Prof. Lind was pretty fair with the readings. Also the readings were pretty interesting and less academic. Sure, there was your fair mix of International Security articles, but a lot of others came out of Foreign Affairs or other more popular outlets. We also didn't read one article with a regression table, which was definitely nice. Overall, I'd say the workload was pretty manageable.\""

It was also extremely difficult to set up a time to meet with Press--he was out of town often at conferences. Overall he's a really nice prof, though. The grading seemed to be fair, and the hardest part of the class was keeping up with the readings (which were important to know for the midterm and final). There was one midterm and an open-book final, and then a 6 page paper due right before the reading period.\"",
            "review 4: \"08F with Daryl Press: Most of the reviews for Press proclaim him as a great lecturer and professor. I'm here to provide other insight. Press is a good speaker, but maybe not the best lecturer. He's the kind of guy that can bullshit his way out of anything, and probably convince you to buy something without even showing you the product. I felt that this ability to do so didn't really translate into being an effective prof, however. The first half of the term was decent. His lectures were actually consistent with the assigned readings. He did go very, very fast though. A few of us brought this to his attention, so he did his best to slow down, but without a midterm until much later, there was at that point nothing really reinforcing the material. The first midterm was your typical blue-book government exam, fairly easy questions, but Press was a bit of a tough grader. He's the kind of guy that knows what he wants, and you had better figure that out early. After that the class went dramatically downhill. Press re-arranged the syllabus, he missed a few classes (actually cancelled them at literally the last minute, people had already arrived to class by the time he cancelled them). One of the lectures, albeit very interesting, had absolutely nothing to do with the assigned reading. Things just kind of became an unorganized mess. The problem was that he had devoted all of his time to his Gov't 83 seminar, Military Statecraft. I know this for a fact because I had two good friends in that class, and they had 50 page papers due, and he was meeting at nights to help them with it. He really didn't pay much attention to our class at this point. The final was pretty easy, and the 6 page paper due right before reading period wasn't too bad either. It was the kind of thing that just made sure we did the reading. So overall, if you take this class, you're in for an unorganized whirlwind of readings and lectures. Press is easy to get along with, although he can seem a bit forward/harsh upon first meeting him. I don't feel like I learned all that much, but a few of the readings, in particular the ones about Sino-Japanese relations, did spark my interest. So take the class if you'd like, it's not a bad decision to do so, but don't expect the utopia that I heard before I signed up for it.\"",

Also, at the end of the term, even though we were doing lots of theory work and such, we had no idea what he really thought. Good job presenting everything. The only hard thing is getting to meet with him not right after class. He's pretty busy, and sometimes double books things. But, he also tries really hard to always be able to meet when you when you ask. The week before finals, he would actually go home to have dinner with his family, and then come back to campus to keep meeting with students. So that's pretty cool. Great class. Take it take it.\"",

            "review 14: \"05W with Daryl Press: Press is an AWESOME PROF, basically the only reason i took this class was because he was teaching it Class was pretty interesting, it was a paper and a midterm plus reading quizes nothing too terrible, but really heavy reading, DONT FALL BEHIND!\"",
            "review 15: \"02W with Daryl Press: I'm an International Relations minor, and you could say that security studies is my \"thing\"... Having said that, this class was a big letdown. Professor Press, while obviously quite knowledgable and enthusiastic about the subject, could not seem to transfer that enthusiasm. This puzzled me to no end, until i realized it was because of the basic banality of his lectures -- he simply talked about the readings from the night before. I realized that coming to class was pointless so long as i did the readings, and stopped coming towards the end. The really bad thing was the grading. Press gave four \"reading quizzes,\" which were multiple choice exams of truly moronic proportions, containing 4-6 questions on about 10 differnt readings. Each quesiton had between 5 and 8 different options, some of which were hardly differentiable. I did all of the reading, and wouild still get 50% correct sometimes. They were basically designed to trip you up and bring your grade down. The final was also ludicrous. His question required the writer to coherently argue for a particular grand strategy AS WELL AS take positions on over 5 different issues and defend those positions as well -- in a 5-6 page paper. It was ridiculously too large to be done in that space, and probably couldn't have been done effectively in 15-20 pages. The topics were simply too disparate. Prof. Press's classroom attitude was also obnoxious. He has an awful habit of ignoring you when your hand is raised, and calling on you when it's not. this becomes rather obvious in a class of 25 people. The habit also stifles discussion, as the people who are prepared to speak on a question don't, and those who aren;t are forced to. Class discussion therefore stayed on the most basic level, and I rarely felt like contributing (as a humorous side note, I was at a large luncheon with Professor Press last week, and for the first time really opened my mouth in front of him. the man was amazed i had a voice and of course barely knew i was in his class) He also tends to be a fairly arbitrary grader, although I personally haven't been burned by that yet.\"",
            "review 16: \"02W with Daryl Press: I took 54 with Mastanduno the previous term, and this would have been GREAT prep for THAT class. This is a more theory-oriented class that helps you learn how to put together a good policy prescription and dissect other people's ideas. (He diced one of my friend's papers and failed it basically because it just wasn't logical, so understand that it's good prep, but you can't totally half-ass it) Press is a strong prof, and if you like this course you should DEFINITELY take 54 (which is easier and more history-oriented, which is easier reading and lecture, especially with Mastanduno). You can't get through Press's class without doing the reading really, especially since he really does penalize for not doing reading by a) constructing difficult multiple choice reading quizes (which are made all the harder by the fact that literally there's 6 questions and if you miss 2 suddenly you're no better than the median student who's done 1 in 5 readings) and b) making you draw on readings specifically in your midterm paper and takehome final to refute or side with. The ONLY downside to this course (besides that you can't really avoid doing pretty much every reading) is you get a lot of people raising their hands and saying inane nonsense... lots of apple polishers in this class too that try and kiss up, and unfortunately Press probably let's it go too far, and you suddenly get half a class devoted to people explaining why they think Huntington's clash of civilizations is the most racist, white thing they've ever read. (he would do well to reel in discussion and lecture more, but then again he covers the readings pretty comprehensively)) (His statecraft class is supposed to be REALLY good, which is why I'm pretty pleased that I'm going to be able to take it next year.) If you are turned off by the political economy aspect of IR, but are interested in security issues, this is a good route, and between the 53, 54, a bunch of the 50.x's and 85 courses, there's plenty out there for people who want to learn about IR but don't give a hoot about economics and international trade. 54 is definitely the easiest of the bunch, but if you're more serious about it, take this class and take it seriously: veyr worth it.\"",

I highly recommend this class and this prof!\"",
            "review 18: \"02F with Daryl Press: this was an interesting course, mainly because Professor Press is a very good speaker and interesting lecturer. Most of the course is extremely relevant to current events, although we didn't reference them too often. We did have one full hour and fourty minute course talking about the military logistics of invading Iraq. There is a lot of reading, and it's almost all loose essays and papers by other scholars. On average there would be about 140 pages a week of reading. The reading is necessary to do because there are three announced reading quizzes, each worth 5% of your grade. 15 percent of your grade isn't that much, but it is enough to get you to do the reading - at least it was for me. he makes the quizzes hard - kind of like AP exam questions - so you have to understand the reading, apply your knowledge, and think about the answers. The quizzes are multiple choice, but he gives you like 8 choices for each question. Also, you have to do the reading b/c you need to understand it in order to write your papers. You have two six page papers in this course. The first one is 35% of your grade and the second is 50%. He only gives you about four days to do them after he announces the assignment, so you generally need to have already done all the relevant reading in order to have enough time. As far as grading is concerned, he is a tough grader, but he gives you very specific criteria before writing your paper. After you get the paper back, you see he makes your grade by using a checklist of which criteria you fulfilled, and then adding up the points - not by just a general feeling like other professors often do.\"",

The early material is a bit difficult to read, because it is mostly drier theory, but it is very very useful to learn in order to understand the rest of the class. From about Week 4 onward, the lectures are a genuine treat because only half the time if that is used for actual lecturing, unless necessary. Govy 53 has a great deal of prof-student interaction during class, and the discussions really frame a large part of the lectures. The material itself is extremely interesting to anyone with any interest in international relations and military/security issues. The class is not heavily technical, except perhaps for the Ballistic Missile Defense section, and is easily accessible without any background in the subject, though measurably better for those with background knowledge. Prof. Press is a fun and engaging lecturer who's enjoyment of the subject is infectious. Rare combinations in any class with a good dose of pure theory. If you want to test out the waters of the IR section of the Department, this class is perfect because you get a good overview of the basic theories of IR which you learn in Govy 5. This class is indeed perfect for aspiring majors who aren't IR concentrators who are looking for the class in which the intro isn't taken. You basically learn all the important stuff from 5, and then some.\""

The class is usually half lecture, break, half discussion which is a little less structured/devolves a little more.

The first half of the class is largely focused around Russian history and so can be pretty boring at times. The first half was also where the readings (often ~100 dense pages) were pivotal to having any clue what was going on in class and on the midterm. The midterm itself was quite hard.

There is a little bit of math in the class, but nothing you can't do without a calculator (I literally got Cs in math all through high school so trust me when I tell you it's fine) and he hold special office hours/review sessions before the exam that are just for the math part of the class. The material is really interesting, and Press does a good job of making the point that the class is more about considering questions than having the right answers. Super reasonable workload, exams are very chill. Would definitely recommend.\""

No complaints about how the class was organized or taught online. Readings were generally manageable and always interesting and pertinent to the class. The most significant factor to consider about this class is that the assessments are extremely challenging: a final based on readings, course content, and examples, and two policy memos about how a change could be made to some event or doctrine that require heavy evidencing and research. Friedman was explicitly clear about what students can expect to do for these assignments, but the work itself was still difficult. The memo format is not so much important as your ability to do lots of research, synthesize an argument, and spend at least 80% of the paper supplying evidence.

The course content -- which focused on civil war theory at the beginning and case studies at the end -- was absolutely fascinating, making it easy to stay engaged for his hour long lectures. There were two memos (one on the Iraq Surge, one on the Taliban Peace Agreement) and one final, which meant that the entirety of your grade was based on pretty much three assignments. It was, without question, an incredibly challenging class that relied on a good amount of prior knowledge on international relations and memo writing, which makes me caution non-gov against blindly signing up for it.\""

If you do the readings (which are >most govt classes) you should be able to keep up with her. You're just going to have to decide whether it's worth the effort. Take tedious notes, on both the readings and classes. If you do, you should be rewarded for it, both in grade and in overall grasp of the Middle East. There was a midterm, a final, and a 10-12 page final paper. The midterm was easy, all id's. If you remember the major names, dates, events, etc. you should be fine. The final was simpler in that it was 1 essay question, but required more in depth analysis and was cumulative. Okay, so the final paper is probably what ate people alive in this class. 10-12 pages isn't THAT bad for a govt class, but Sa'adah expects you to do loads of research. Also, the topic was very broad and I think a lot of people were left scrambling to decide what to write about. DO NOT PUT IT OFF. Also, cite cite cite. Cite everything. The AIC is one of the most complex social enigmas out there, and if you do the reading (all of it) you'll start to become obsessed. My homepage was set to haaretz.com for a little while until I realized how douchey that was. Take this class and you'll see why god is in the details (that was also probably a little douchey). I don't want this review to be discouraging because this was one of, if not the, best classes I've ever taken at Dartmouth. Sa'adah recognizes hard work and will befriend you for it. And it's never bad to have a friend in the govt dept, esp when you need a rec. She's quirky and hilarious and a great person all around. She wants you to succeed and gives you many breaks to do so. So yeah, great class, awesome prof. Take it.\"",

Although, it is a lot of reading (but very interesting), as long as you keep up and do most of it at some point before exams, you should be fine. She is very fair and does not try to trick you on the midterm, giving fair clues beforehand about what might be on it. Also, there is a final paper (20-pages) but you know about it the whole term and the topic is given to you very much in advance. If you appreciate a prof who is an expert on the material and will challenge you so that you learn, then take this class with Sa'adah. Some people complained that she was condescending but I never got that vibe and even if she was, she has a right to be, she knows her stuff! Basically, as long as you're willing to put in the work (i.e. do the reading and go to class) and you show this to Sa'adah you should do well in the class. Don't be discouraged by a low median grade!

The level of her class is above that of most if not all of the other government classes I have taken here. She has standards. She wants you to think critically about the subject involved. It's not an easy subject, and the class is difficult because there is not correct or incorrect viewpoint and hence no correct answer. Her lectures are top notch. They appear meandering at times, but in fact if you step back and read your notes carefully you'll see why she lectures on the topics and order that she does. This class covers both the Israeli/Jewish viewpoint as well as the Palestinian, Arab, and Egyptian viewpoint of the conflict. It covers about 150 years of history and 6 different countries. You don't just learn about Palestine and Israel, but you also learn a great deal about other vital players such as Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria. I learned so much more in this course than I ever could have imagined. This is a reading and thinking intensive course, so if you're looking for a easy A don't take this class. If you don't care about your grade (she is a tough grader) but you care about learning, then you should most definitely take this class. This is one of the few classes at Dartmouth I would choose to take even if I knew I would get a really bad grade in it. Fortunately, she is a tough grader but a very fair grader. She expects you to write with both substance and style, and she wants you to source things carefully (nothing wrong with that.) There was a midterm that was worth 20% of our grade, and then a final and a paper due the week of our final exam that together were worth 80% of your grade, so it's a very backloaded class. Do not procrastinate on your paper and on your readings, or you will want to shoot yourself the last week of class.

It's all interesting. Stay on top of it as much as you can, and accept that you might not be able to get through it all. Grades were based solely on a take-home midterm and three papers.

If she's not your favorite, Sa'adah will screw you over. Her idea of good writing is so arbitrary it boggles the mind. She likes some words, not others, even if the difference in the shade of meaning is miniscule. 2. You can go to her office hours - she's not going to tell you how to write the paper. Or like your paper even if you follow her guidelines. Her idea of analysis is vague and fluffy, no doubt culled from her days pursuing a BA in Social Science. 3. She has a grading rubric but she won't use it consistently. Your mistakes on the paper may elicit a B-, but the next guy might get an A-. She cited 2 people to COS for plagiarizing 3 words on a midterm paper. 4. Oh - she ignores your blitzes if she feels like it. And she is pretty rude and demeaning in office hours. I love frank and straightforward professors, but not snide ones. She is firmly in the latter category. If you want to study about the conflict - study it with ANYONE ELSE. Read a damn book instead. Steer clear of this professor. Workload: Workload was ok. 3 papers. Lectures and readings were largely disconnected, and lectures were useless for the papers. Stress added only by crazy prof.\""

About half way through the term, his lectures diverged from insightful and thoughtful to a line by line reading of the various readings he had assigned for the day. Furthermore, he had told us on the front end he was leaving campus early and we would have our \"finals\" during the last week of class - which is fine. However, upon picking up my grades, the only indication he had read either of my two final essays or final papers were three incoherent scribble marks on the back. No comments, no criticism, nothing.

As a result, it can feel like you were supposed to already know the basics by the time you do the reading and attend lecture. Reading was immense (hours per session), but mostly interesting, and you could get by pretty well without doing it all.

The course material felt more like an unreasonably detailed history class as opposed to a government class. Productive student discussions of the conflict in class are rare, and the lectures are hard to follow (material is barely chronological and jumps around various time periods). Lectures are also comprised of unproductive cold calling, which makes class pretty stressful.

He was rude and condescending when people asked questions in class, and completely unhelpful in office hours--he made me and two of my friends in the class literally cry at three separate times when we came to office hours to ask a question about our final papers. The readings are also incredibly long and dense, and lectures are very dry. He is definitely very knowledgable about the topic but it's not worth taking the class as he isomer interested in hearing himself talk than in actually educating students.

Most of them didn't follow the time period that they were supposed to address. Avishai would often go on tangents about future or past events that, if you didn't already have background knowledge, were quite confusing. There didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to his grading, and honestly, the grades seemed arbitrary. We never received grades on our midterm, memo, or final until after grades were due.

He did a good job presenting the conflict in an unbiased manner (in terms of pro-Palestinian vs pro-Israel). He is an Israeli citizen (lives in Israel half the year) and would consider himself in the liberal wing of Israeli politics, meaning that he is for a peace agreement, against settlements/ the occupation, and believes in a secular Jewish state (rather than control by the rabbinate).

Basically all the material in the class is just from Magid's lectures which don't have accompanying slides, or a clear plan every class.

There's not that much reading (it was a 2A, and we'd have maybe a couple short articles and occasionally a longer one) but they actually fit with what we were learning about! Almost as if she had planned the reading to complement the class and enhance our learning, not to just screw over people with random questions to make a worthless class seem hard and detailed or to test on two completely different sets of material (being a gov major has made me bitter).

Class exercises and simulations were used to demonstrate concepts, and every class was really interesting.

The paper isn't a big deal, you can pick your own topic.

Gov midlevels are hard by definition... you are dealing with a strict B+ median but you also have more challenging material. Barabas doesn't make this any easier by being a frustratingly inconsistent/nitpicky grader at times. He will blatantly miss parts of your assignments at some points, or he will zero in on something that you did as bad and cite a source you were never assigned to read but he suggested once in class. Speaking of readings, there's a lot, and they are dense. And he assigns supplemental readings that you don't technically have to read, but he will take off points on assignments if you do something that contradicts those readings. And these aren't the complaints of someone who did bad in the class... I got above the median! Despite these flaws, it's still a very interesting/important class. You will come out of the class with a solid understanding of polling/survey research fundamentals, which are really important tools to have if you are interested in Gov/Poli Sci. The readings are really useful, and Barabas is a great lecturer. He's also willing to answer any questions you have/engage with your own thoughts, whether it be in class or in office hours. The workload can be tough with the readings, but the actual assigned work (6 Homework assignments, 1 midterm, 1 final project) is very doable if you plan your time well (which I didn't, but that's a me problem).

However, I often found it difficult to stay focused during the lecture given that Professor Bafumi doesn't really use slides all too much when he is teaching, which can make it somewhat difficult to comprehend the material in the virtual setting if you are more of a visual learner. Unclear whether this is just a \"Zoom term\" thing for him or if he just prefers not to use slides, but if you're a visual learner like me, it's something to consider and can be a bit frustrating when you realize at the end of class that you don't remember everything that was just taught.

I actually ran into Professor Clark this term (18F) and he suggested I drop by his office to catch up, even though I'm no longer his student. Definitely nice when professors are so openly invested in their students, even those who are no longer in their classes. 20.03 is a great class-- manageable and surprisingly interesting reading (engaging enough that I very willingly read all of it), concise and short lectures, and heavily discussion-based classes. Grades are based on participation, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a research paper. The research paper is long-- mine was 20+ pages and took me like 3-4 weeks to write but the prompt is extremely open-ended and I picked a topic that I was really interested in and am really glad I dove so deep into it.

            "review 1: \"21F with Deborah Brooks: Overview: DO NOT TAKE THIS. I am a Gov major and a WGSS minor and I hated this class so much, it ruined my entire term. Brooks is one of the most frustrating, uncaring people I have met on this campus. This class is full of busywork, totally unclear standards, and completely subjective grades. I spent hours on the assignments and readings every week and always contributed in class and she still gave me terrible comments on assignments and only called on my when forced to. General workload: WAY too much for what this class is. Yes the material is interesting, but there are so many readings every week that by week 3 everyone was already drowning. There is a response journal due every Thursday that is literally just regurgitating everything that the readings say (not hard, just very time consuming); these must be formatted EXACTLY how she wants them (which she didn't explain for several weeks) and cannot contain anything but Brooks' opinion and quotes for the readings or you will need to redo it or get a zero. There is also a \"hyper deck\" to review every week instead of a lecture, which is basically just a long powerpoint full of transitions that make it take forever to get through. Make sure you bring up points from the hyperdecks and at least two of the readings per week in discussion or your grade will suffer. Also, you need to submit a 7-page google form detailing what you learned that night after every class by no later than 8 pm that night; if you do not do this, your grade will also suffer. Major assignments: there are two, a country comparison project (everyone researched a country and did a long worksheet comparing it to the US) and a podcast project (people worked in groups of 2-4 to produce a podcast on a topic from class of their choosing). Literally everyone did absolutely terribly on the country comparison project, even the people she liked, so I guess she just really didn't make her instructions clear. The podcast project was fun though and you get to listen to everyone's/listen to them present about their topic at the end of class (this was literally the only thing I liked about the class). There is also a final paper if you go \"off contract\" (ie don\u2019t fulfill her minimum requirements for a B+) but no midterm/final (though the country comparison project is basically a midterm paper) Class discussions: the small group discussions are fine because you mostly get to do your own thing while discussing that week's material, but the full-class meetings led by Brooks herself are terrible. She is so unironically a girlboss feminist--think Kyrsten Sinema/Kirsten Gillibrand vibes. She also constantly mentions the need to consider intersectionality in the course materials, but that felt extremely performative to me as any time a person of color would actually discuss their lived experience with respect to the course materials, she would immediately shut it down and move back to white feminism only (also, anytime anything about feminism in Africa came up in class, she would refer to the one girl in class whose parents were African--yikes). She spends so much of her time trying to prove to everyone how cool and in touch she is, but is actually just perpetuating the conversation dynamics that she claims to hate. Also, she made us have every single one of our classes except for one outside; when one of my classmates who was anemic asked to move inside on a day when it was under 40 degrees, she said that a) classmate would have never asked that of a male professor and b) she could direct us to the silk long underwear she buys if we wanted to keep warm. To conclude: this could have been a great class but Brooks made it terrible. There is an upside as my discussion group got really close through our hatred of our prof, but overall I cannot discourage you enough from taking this.\"",

I am a STEM major and didn't find the readings that bad. It is not a light workload, but it is super fascinating. Her projects are probably the worst part - they are not specific. However, if you check in with her once early on, she will probably give you an A for engaging with her (anecdotally my experience). She can overwhelm discussions at times, but some of the best discussions I have ever had were in that class despite it. Overall, not a light class at all but an interesting one and one that skimming the readings is totally okay in. Also, the 'final' project is done week 8, and there is nothing due besides a reflection week 9, so you don't have a final in that class or a lot of work during finals prep time for other classes, which was really nice. Is it a layup? No, but it is not atrocious at all.

The few times she did open the class up for discussion, she oftentimes became hostile at students who did not have the most extreme \"feminist\" views. For example, she had us do an \"agree/disagree\" exercise about gender quotas in politics. I stood on the disagree side along with many other students and she asked for our reasoning. I said that as a woman, i personally wouldn't want to be elected to a position because of a gender quota because people might question my legitimacy. Brooks proceeded to compare me to Trump's education secretary saying that i \"sounded just like her\" ... it was honestly embarrassing and super inappropriate.

Lacy gives 0 to minimal instruction on what he's looking for and the structure of the class makes it really difficult to learn the greater substance behind the labs. We had several chapters of Statistics textbook reading per night, but the grade in the class relied exclusively upon our 7 labs which each took ~15 hours of group work with the breakthrough coming only after someone spent about an hour in his office hours (held once a week for an hour) in order to decipher what we needed to do. The grade in the class was based upon arbitrary labeling and wording and graded extremely inconsistently by a TA. When the TA made a mistake, we could petition for a regrade but rarely received the full number of points back.

You go over some interesting concepts, but applicability is a bit limited - for instance, a lot of the concepts you go over are predicated on defined utility values, but barely any time was spent addressing how to ascertain those utilities. Also, while other classes that have game theory readings focus on the policy applications rather than the theoretical basis, this class is the opposite - you'll spend the whole class figuring out why players act in a certain way with Prof. Herron making a 30-second aside to the real-life application. The problem sets can get very confusing, mainly because Prof. Herron and the textbook only teach you so much, and then expect you to do the more advanced problems. This led to frequent hurdles for the homework groups, especially those lacking smart students (and those willing to frequently go to office hours). Fortunately, though, the tests never throw any curveballs, so if you understand the homework, a lot of the test problems are doable. Prof. Herron gives you old tests and answer keys to work off of, making things go much easier for you.

By this, I mean that the game-theoretic results we discussed were probably not things I would have seen on my own, but once I saw them, they were clear; the ideas were so powerful and fundamental that they quickly changed my intuition. I think that's the most powerful kind of learning, when our intuition itself changes. It was amazing to see the extreme simplifications of real world situations that we made. For instance, we typically said there are two players, and each has two or three choices, for maybe four or six or nine total possible outcomes, and for each outcome a payoff for each player. And even in this highly simplified state, the tensions that really exist in the \"real world\" manifested themself -- the tendency to competition/cooperation, the problem of incomplete information, and so on. Professor Herron was a very interesting guy, and in general I'm fairly impressed with how he made the class accessible to students with almost zero math background (lol) and interesting to those with LOTS of math background. That said, the course was sometimes tedious... for instance, we did calculus review. I found myself tuning this out, and when I tuned back in often we were on a new topic that was unknown to me, so I was lost. Some of the textbook exercises we did for homework were truly fascinating. Some, however, were extraordinarily boring. One asked the student to go through the book up until that exercise, finding each \"extensive-form game\" given and describing whether it has perfect or imperfect information. And professor Herron actually made us do this exercise! As I discussed with a classmate of mine, there are other ways to teach a subject than through repetition, like through understanding. Anyway, in general a great class, and I may as a result do more game theory in the future.

The class uses a flipped- classroom format, where we used class time for homework and learned outside of class.

That subscription costs you 33.25 per month, so you are essentially paying what probably amounts to 4900 extra dollars for next to nothing. Professor Cooper is in class to help with your classwork assignments, but his input I found to be most useful in that he pretty much found syntactical errors and forgotten commas, parentheses, etc.- essentially stuff that you could find on your own. The reversed classroom was also kind of annoying in the fact that assignments were due 9 pm the evening following the class period- so you best have the time cut out after class to grind out the assignments. In terms of learning in the class, I found the most help in using Google and asking my classmates for help, and Professor Cooper's help to be very much less useful.

However this is the worst government course ever - had I been a sophmore or first year, I would have dropped the major (in fact, several students in the class dropped the class and the major.) Statistics is never going to be exciting, but some professors make it fairly interesting and informative. Moreover, this is supposed to be a class about political science research methods as well. It wasn't. Most of the classes were spent playing with STATA (statistics computer program) or writing regression equations without explaining what either the computer models or regression lines meant. The class was boring beyond belief. Reading - the book about research methods was interesting and well written. The Statistics book was organized poorly - moreover it was a more mathematical book. If the professor wanted to use it, he should have used it properly - including the problem sets in the book. Frankly, I would have learned a lot more about statistical math by doing those problems than from the class - unfortunately that had little to do with the assignments. Some of the poli sci articles were good - too bad they weren't discussed in the class / had anything to do with the class. Lectures - the lectures were boring, long, and difficult to follow. Lebo constantly made mistakes with the software, calculations, and so forth, so it was very difficult to follow him. Assignments - the course had four assignments, each worth a quarter of the total grade. Too bad what we did in class gave no substantive knowledge to use on the assignments (it did, however, teach us to play with stata). They could have been done well, and it would be better if the prof had assigned working groups and presentations or something, rather than have people do the assignments alone, which was somewhat impossible. Lebo - Lebo seems like a nice guy. And he's undoubtedly smart. However, he was the worst professor I have ever had at Dartmouth. He seems nervous around students - his emails are curt, and he failed to answer emails the week befor e the first assignment was due. He isn't very good about answering questions or helping students work on the course (which frankly, he should since its his confusing lectures that messed up student's thinking). He also is hard to follow in class. It might just be the nerves of a new professor, or he could just not like to teach this particular class. In sum, don't take this class from this prof.\"",

Often the entire class had no idea what was going on with the work. The concepts are explained quite poorly and at the end of the term, I know minimally more about statistics than I did at the beginning. The work consisted of three projects and a take home final, all worth 25% of the grade. Basically, you need to learn all you can on your own or in a group from the text or outside sources for each project as they are very hard to figure out based on lecture. A statistics/data analysis program called Stata is used, but it is mostly confusing because without understanding the concepts, like a lot of people didn't, it just seems like gibberish.

Professor Horiuchi would lecture most days and assign readings outside of class for each lecture. The readings are good to solidify and reemphasize the lecture material, but they aren't really necessary. The X-hours were used to learn the programming language R. The first 5 weeks were all about research design, and the second 5 weeks were all about statistical analysis. A stats background is pretty helpful, but not necessary. Professor Horiuchi was super nice and always helpful. He's interesting and he's very knowledgeable in the material he teaches. The curriculum is interesting and very applicable. Horiuchi taught the research design component very well, but he wasn't great at explaining some of the statistical analysis concepts. The assignments were all mildly to moderately difficult. The first three homework assignments were decently manageable, but the last three homework assignments were significantly harder and more time-consuming. The group project is kind of a lot of work, but it helps to have knowledgeable, friendly, and hardworking team members. The group project seems hard at first because it is hard to know what Horiuchi is looking for when you are first brainstorming and planning, but he gives feedback along the way and it becomes no more difficult than a normal group project. If you pick a good topic for your group project, it becomes more enjoyable and interesting. The exams weren't too bad, just be sure to give a good amount of effort studying It is very very ambitious to try to teach R in no more than 8 hours, and he didn't cover the basics of R well, probably because this aspect of the course had to be rushed. The whole class seemed lost in R, especially because it felt like we kinda skipped over some important foundational skills and got into more complex R concepts. There are questions on R on the final, and you have to do a statistical analysis in R for the group project (with Horiuchi's help).

Also, don't hesitate to ask him any question you may have. You can do so both in lecture and office hours. Workload: There's honestly not that much work.

He also puts his slideshows on Blackboard, which he explicitly says are the only thing you need to study for the midterm and the final. Aside from both of those, he assesses you in two other ways. First, he has you read political science articles of your choice and then has you write a \"Short Note\" on each article you read. He specifies what you need to have in your \"Short Note\". Second, he has everyone do a group project involving original research. Groups can either replicate a prior study and make a couple of small changes or research an entirely new topic of their own.

After that, he talked less and tried to guide the discussion instead of dominating it himself. He was available outside of office hours, but not a whole lot of help on the essays.

Additionally, Professor Murphy is too awkward with the discussions to let things proceed fluidly. He cuts points off, asks obscure questions and sits in silence while no one can answer, and makes nervous jokes that as best elicit a smile from two or three people. He is very intelligent, so it's really a shame that we didn't learn more from him in the discussions.

Don't take this class if you're not willing to do a lot of reading (it's a lot of dense texts like Plato, Aristotle, etc) and quite a fair bit of writing too. Structurally I wasn't a huge fan of his homework system - he makes you write a blog post reacting to the reading and submit it before class that day. Pretty easy (200 words) but also boring and felt like a chore. Class is pretty chill, he'd have us split into breakout rooms which would either be decent or completely awkward depending on if you got a tryhard freshman. There are also a fair few of those in the class too. I don't like his office hours, as he uses the third class of the week to hold an \"open forum\" style of office hours. Since everyone's there it's impossible to ask a personal question about your essays, and it means we really only have two classes a week. Everyone shows up in one 30-person Zoom room and he goes down the list of attendees and has them ask their question(s). If he accidentally skips your name you're out of luck.

Not hard to get that, but anything higher takes a fair bit of effort, and an A is pretty much impossible to get. I've enjoyed the debates, as the topics are pretty balanced so both sides get to put on a good argument.

Debates and discussions with the whole class are very interesting notwithstanding the inevitable TRYHARDS. We know participation is 25% but damn give other people a chance. To add to this Murphy is too nice to not acknowledge someone with a question or comment. Be prepared to be one of those who butts in every once in a while to put in your 2 cents. This is the kind of class where it seems like you can slack on the readings and still do well - you certainly won't be penalized for it because there isn't any specific exam on them per se with murphy. There are just three two page essays on a quote of your choice and a reading response blog for every assigned reading (200 words). That being said, your essays would be significantly better if you actually digest and internalize the material as you'll be able to reference and quote from various authors to synthesize a good argument or explication. HIGHLIGHT AS YOU READ. You definitely don't want to spend 2 days looking through all the readings to choose a quote for your essay.

The format is essentially this: we do the readings for class (they are long, and if you're going to read them to understand them, you'll likely need a couple hours), listen to Prof. Murphy's lecture, write a ~200 word blog response, and then \"discuss\" the text as a class. Once every 2-3 weeks, we'll have an essay due (very manageable: two pages single spaced with no outside research). There are three essays total, and each essay is more difficult to write than the last. For each essay, you pick a quote (1-2 sentences) that stood out to you from the text. In your first essay, you explain the quote you chose. In the second, you apply the quote you chose to your own life. And in the third, you evaluate whether or not the quote you chose is true, similar to writing a philosophy paper. None of these assignments are incredibly challenging (I always wrote my essays in the day before they were due), and because they focused on specific quotes, you weren't really encouraged to do the reading. The lectures also have all of the content necessary to contribute meaningfully to in-class discussions. So while I did the readings for each class, it would sometimes feel a bit as though I was wasting my time. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the class, and I would suggest doing the readings if you can. Murphy is a nice guy, very well-versed in political philosophy, and although a tough grader, also very clear (imo) with his feedback regarding how you can improve your essay.

This is a nice approach because the class is pretty relaxed, but makes for a LOT of reading outside of class, and requires a blog post to be turned in before each class. I think the blogs are OK, but it gets old after a while and it's pretty easy to lose interest in that part of the homework. The class had 3 papers of 2 pages each, which were pretty easy so long as one takes the time to write and edit at least once. It's basically impossible to get an A in this class though, as the writing assistants are of little help in actually making your paper deserving of a higher grade. My WA did basically nothing, and I think I would've done just as well without their help. Murphy barely gives out any 93s (which are A-s), and no As on papers, and to get an A one has to score above 94 on everything other than the papers, and participate in the extra credit debates (which are really easy).

I've also heard that he favors papers that share his opinion or the viewpoint he discusses in class, but I have trouble writing solely about an opinion that isn't mine.

An A- is completely doable if you're a decent writer, but from what I can tell, he does not give A's unless you do the extra credit debates. In short, if you are looking for a layup that will bring down your GPA and suck your soul a little bit every time you trudge to Murphy's mind-numbing lectures for no other reason than the attendance points, this is the class for you.\"",

Pick your favorite, the class reflects the tone of either. I recommend this course with the same level of excitement as I would for foco cottage cheese. I don't think Jim Murphy is a bad guy but his grading was based off of a) how good your first paper was and b) how much your writing reflected his thoughts. The course only has three papers, each worth 25%. I submitted a meh essay for the first and got a fair grade back. I submitted a trash essay for the second ... same grade as the first, down to the percentage point. Saved the best essay for last ... same grade. I learned very little from this class about political thoughts but quite a bit about sucking up to professors. Jim told my friend she was \u201cover gendering\u201d an experience from her own life that he knew nothing about. She begrudgingly changed her essay and earned a class-high grade in fear of penalization. The assignment, for what it's worth, asked for a personal story.

Lots of class time is devoted to class discussion, but discussions will inevitably be dominated by the same few people.

My favorite anecdote from this class was going to office hours to discuss a personal essay that included a story from my own life and then having Murphy tell me I was misinterpreting my own story. In the course\u2019s defense, I will say this: the class is by far the easiest intro gov course in terms of workload. There are readings, three short essays, one optional revision, and NO final.\"",

Only 3 papers throughout the term (no midterm, no final!!!!), which isn't bad at all. The class was stimulating because only the die hards stuck around after Day 1.

The exams (midterm, final, and one for extra credit) were all open notes/open book, and could be reviewed by the prof. before they were due (a week after being assigned). I liked this course for so many reasons. Reading such important philosophers and discussing them at an advanced level was an excellent introduction to government at Dartmouth. Actually being able to participate in a class that had less than 100 students (around 40 i think) was also a plus. Lastly, even though the material studied often carried a certain intellectual depth, the class often was conducted in a more informal and lighthearted manner, which was certainly appreciated.

He provides useful lecture outlines and invaluable (yet optional) study questions to aid critical evaluation of readings. He is quite effective at conveying the strengths and weaknesses of moral and philosophical theories. That said, he lacks charisma and is not a skilled public speaker, so students who stay up all night may have difficulty remaining awake for the entirety of his lectures.

            "review 28: \"05F with Lucas Swaine: very funny prof\"",
            "review 29: \"05F with Lucas Swaine: I had been waiting to take Govt 6 to cycle in Prof. Swaine for about a year - the other professors had poor reviews, and people had many negative things to say about them, so I decided it would be wise to wait for Prof. Lucas Swaine to come about so that I could get the most of my Govt 6 experience. In terms of the other professors, I felt I made a good decision - I don't see the other professors (being both biased and boring) being better than Lucas Swaine. Prof. Swaine is an amazing guy. Nutty, funny, weird, warm, understanding, and nice begin to describe him. He starts off each class asking if the students (mostly freshmen) have any questions about the course or Dartmouth life in general. His lectures pretty much condense the previous night's reading in 40 minutes, in which he highlights key points, and most importantly, provides parenthetical citations (he actually says, \"On page 30, 2/3 down the second column, he writes...\"). Sometimes I felt like because we had to cover so many pieces in so little time, Swaine had to focus on those key points, and didn't have enough time to clarify the arguments enough so that the majority of the class would understand the texts. Prof. Swaine remains as unbiased as he can be, and that entails the usual ups and downs (unbiased and doesn't shoot down, but on the flip side we never get to hear his opinions), since it is apparent he knows the texts inside and out. In addition to the 40-minute summary, he opens the floor to roughly 20 minutes of discussion, where he helps guide the conversation with probing questions, pointing out misinterpretations, and jotting down brief notes on the board. Unfortunately, many of the things talked about seemed restricted to the piece itself, and ended up being boring or abstract enough to limit the discussions to the same handful of participants each day. As for the readings themselves, while a cursory glance over the syllabus might lead you to believe they're short, don't be fooled. Not only are those readings a) textbook readings (where the pages are huuuge), but they're also b) very, very dense at times. Only a handful of authors are direct with their views, leaving the majority having these confusing readings that you have to go through at a sluggish pace to comprehend what's going on. Fortunately, being famous texts, there's a multitude of online summaries available, so if you don't feel like reading about one guy, you can rely on the summary. In class, if you can type fast enough, you can play stenographer for those 40 minutes and get down all of Swaine's lectures, textual allusions, and citations, which makes your notes come in extremely handy when it comes paper time. The take-home papers are always masterfully crafted so a) depending on how you read them, you can go about them in many directions, and b) are never too hard. They're always within the grasp of the main argument and allow you to really have to understand it to draw upon it. That being said, since chances are Prof. Swaine will know the texts inside and out, and you won't, there's always a problem of him pointing out something in the text you may have carelessly looked over. As for grading, Prof. Swaine does not curve. I got the impression that he starts off grading low and eventually (whether intentionally or subconsciously) boosts the grades as the term progresses. He analyzes your arguments with a fine-tooth comb, and in addition to providing a good amount of comments (in a timely fashion, too), points out the holes in your argument, and what you could/should have included. I feel that sometimes he'd deduct from your grade for not being able to cram some arguments in when you were already pushing the length cap, which I thought was pretty sketchy, but overall the papers went okay. The test formats ran the gamut, all paper-driven. He went through multiple test formats: take-home (over the weekend after you read the materials for one, two weeks ahead of time after you read half of the materials for another), an in-class midterm the Friday of Homecoming that he made the D for (two questions, answered in the blue booklet), and what may have been more infamous than that, the final. The final was take-home. You had to write an 8-page paper, due two days before finals week ended. We were given an envelope with the paper questions. After opening the envelope, we had 24 hours to write those 8 pages. We were to open the envelope, choose one of the three questions, plan out your essay, and ask/blitz Prof. Swaine questions (hoping he'd reply in a timely manner) in a day. While it was stressful, the variety of questions and the range they encompassed was good enough so that writing the 8-pager wasn't so bad. Overall, the class okay. I would've appreciated applying the concepts to real, everyday life, rather than discussing what-if Utopias that although are inaccessible, are supposedly worth pondering anyway. Thus, The Prince (Machiavelli), The Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels), and On Liberty (John Stuart Mill arguing for free speech) fell into this category and ended up being possibly the most important reads of the course. If you plan on majoring in or working with the government, it's worth knowing the arguments of some of the most important political philosophers of all time (many whose influence upon American government is definitely seen). I'd recommend taking the course if the pieces fascinate you and you're willing to put in the (mostly mental) effort into everything, as it is very possible that you enter the class without the motivation, that you'll be leaving it without it as well. (On a side-note, one of the questions typically asked in a Govt. Dept. course evaluation at the end is whether the course was better than the others you've taken. While I'm sure the freshmen were impressed, my answer to the question came quickly: no. Govt 6 does not compare to the interest level or importance of the previous government courses I've taken.)\"",

            "review 36: \"03W with Nelson Kasfir: Government 6 with Kasfir is a hard course for me to review; the material is so good, yet the professor was so bad, despite his best intentions. Before I go further, I should say that Professor Kasfir is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I have ever met (let alone professors). Professor Kasfir's behavior has garnered nothing but respect from me, and I fully appreciate his intellectual genius and curiosity, dedication to the material, and forgiving nature. In short, Kasfir is a great human being, it seems. However, being a wonderful person does not necessarily make one a great professor. Kasfir uses the \"old style\" of pure monotone lecture, although he tries to disguise it in a faux discussion atmosphere, which more closely resembles Joe McCarthy picking on unsuspecting victims while hiding his voice behind one of those cancer-induced mechanized voice-boxes. In short, Kasfir's lectures are painful. And in the 2A time slot, Kasfir's lectures border on deadly. What makes it all so sad is that the material is incredible. Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Locke, and others constitute the core of modern political philosophy. It's really some great stuff. But Kasfir manages to kill the material through inflexible (indeed, totally intractable and indebatable) interpretations of the text. He also scores zero points for enthusiasm for the subject matter. He had a couple of moments in class where he improvised, seemingly deviating from a script, where he was simply brilliant. There's a lot of passion hiding behind the cool, opaque exterior, and Kasfir just needs to let it out more. If he even did it once a class, my entire experience would be better. To boil things down, this is a class to take if you're unbelievably into the material. It also really helps if you have had experience with the subject matter beforehand, as you can do more thinking for yourself rather than buy Kasfir's interpretations hook-line-and-sinker. Oh, right, one last thing: The exams and the paper. The paper is totally open-ended and must be less than 6 pages in length. Not something to stress. The exams, though, are so unbearably time-limited, it's impossible to do representative work. Unless you're able to write 20 pages in a blue book in one hour, you're going to face some difficulties. With multi-essay exams with 4-7 identification questions (with 1-page recommended lengths), 1 hour per test seems and, indeed, is woefully lacking. Complain loudly and early about the time limits. My class learned that the hard way. So, I'd say take the course, definitely. But take it with Professor Lucas Swaine, who is a rising star in the Government Department. Between Swaine and Professor Press, Dartmouth might just be blessed with having two of the most promising young intellectuals in the country. Kasfir, a top intellectual of a past age, is beyond his prime, and a professor to avoid, unless you're fine with skipping lectures and not having the \"correct\" interpretation.

So as long as you attend class for the discussions and read at least summaries of the reading materials, you will do fine. This course is good for making you familiar with important works in philosophy and politics that you really need to know anyway.

The lectures were a bit boring and fast sometimes; Professor Kasfir used the Socratic method, meaning the class is based around discussions, reading excerpts from the texts and analyzing the texts. There are two midterms and a final paper. The midterms aren't bad; just make sure you take good notes and understand the overall concepts, and you'll do fine on the midterms.

Professor Kasfir is also a very kind, gentlemanly professor. However, there are some things students should know before taking this course. The class is structured around the \"Socratic method\" of teaching. Ideally, Prof. Kasfir asks questions of students and then provokes discussion about the ideas expressed. However, there is little balance between getting what needs to be done out of the way and asking students questions. The \"discussion\" consists of Prof. Kasfir waiting until he gets the answer he wants to hear so that he can go on. If there is a question that strays from what he wants to get to, he'll say that we're \"off-topic\" or \"we'll get to that later.\" While the idea of discussion sounds interesting, its style could have been replaced by lecture. The class is a 2A, which should seriously be taken into account. I found that the first hour was generally interesting, but I usually dropped off after the break. Be ready to spend a ton of time doing reading that is extremely rewarding. If that's what you're looking for, then by all means take this course.

However, this persona tends to hide the side of him that is exposed as a professor: that of a traditional, pedagogical teacher. Class discussion is very, very contrived. Since Kasfir teaches \"Socratically,\" he answers students questions by stringing them along a series of related questions of his own. This process takes a while, and does not produce much benefit for the effort that it requires. As a result, classes often drag on, and material is seldom discussed in time, per the schedule given on the syllabus. Discussion is more or less dead. Kasfir has complete control over it. Several times a class, he will cut off interesting subjects, dismissing them by saying that \"we'll save that for later,\" or \"you're getting ahead of yourself,\" or \"we can't discuss that right now.\" If discussion waivers from his lecture's outline, which he apparently brings to class every day, he quickly nips it at the bud. The problem with this is that the course material is amazing. You could not possibly have more interesting reading. If you're a political theory buff, you'll love it even more. Plato, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and more -- they're all amazing, and the texts, as a result, are enthralling. While you may enjoy the reading the night before class, you'll find yourself nodding off while discussing it during class. Kasfir may be one kind and warm gentlemen, but he has the capacity to make the most interesting of subjects appear tedious and boring. During the 2-hour, 2A time-slot of this course, he often forgets or ignores breaks. Worse yet, he tends to go past the time alotted, as well.

Before I go further, I should say that Professor Kasfir is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I have ever met (let alone professors). Professor Kasfir's behavior has garnered nothing but respect from me, and I fully appreciate his intellectual genius and curiosity, dedication to the material, and forgiving nature. In short, Kasfir is a great human being, it seems. However, being a wonderful person does not necessarily make one a great professor. Kasfir uses the \"old style\" of pure monotone lecture, although he tries to disguise it in a faux discussion atmosphere, which more closely resembles Joe McCarthy picking on unsuspecting victims while hiding his voice behind one of those cancer-induced mechanized voice-boxes. In short, Kasfir's lectures are painful. And in the 2A time slot, Kasfir's lectures border on deadly. What makes it all so sad is that the material is incredible. Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Locke, and others constitute the core of modern political philosophy. It's really some great stuff. But Kasfir manages to kill the material through inflexible (indeed, totally intractable and indebatable) interpretations of the text. He also scores zero points for enthusiasm for the subject matter. He had a couple of moments in class where he improvised, seemingly deviating from a script, where he was simply brilliant. There's a lot of passion hiding behind the cool, opaque exterior, and Kasfir just needs to let it out more. If he even did it once a class, my entire experience would be better. To boil things down, this is a class to take if you're unbelievably into the material. It also really helps if you have had experience with the subject matter beforehand, as you can do more thinking for yourself rather than buy Kasfir's interpretations hook-line-and-sinker. Oh, right, one last thing: The exams and the paper. The paper is totally open-ended and must be less than 6 pages in length. Not something to stress. The exams, though, are so unbearably time-limited, it's impossible to do representative work. Unless you're able to write 20 pages in a blue book in one hour, you're going to face some difficulties. With multi-essay exams with 4-7 identification questions (with 1-page recommended lengths), 1 hour per test seems and, indeed, is woefully lacking. Complain loudly and early about the time limits. My class learned that the hard way. So, I'd say take the course, definitely. But take it with Professor Lucas Swaine, who is a rising star in the Government Department. Between Swaine and Professor Press, Dartmouth might just be blessed with having two of the most promising young intellectuals in the country. Kasfir, a top intellectual of a past age, is beyond his prime, and a professor to avoid, unless you're fine with skipping lectures and not having the \"correct\" interpretation. My advice: Go with Swaine and you'll have a top-notch experience.\"",

Taking the class with Clarke ensures that you will learn (and retain) so much information and enjoy it as well, but be prepared to put in the work. This class isn't a layup because Clarke is an unfair grader or her expectations are too high, but that there is a lot of material that must be understood in order to do well on assessments. Delivery during a virtual term consisted of meeting once a week with a third of the class as a discussion section (but still included Clarke talking for longer periods about specific topics). Two or three asynchronous lectures by a Yale professor were assigned each week which were good but obviously not ideal. During this virtual term, the class was graded on participation, weekly discussion posts, a 24-hour paper, and a 3-hour final exam of short essays. All assignments and classes require a solid understanding of each thinker; it would be hard to participate or develop an answer with just the SparkNotes. Clarke herself is brilliant: extremely knowledgable and enjoys teaching. During term she was very accessible, having seven hours for office hours a week. The demanding nature of the course and her high expectations can make her seem intimidating, but if you just roll with it she comes across as a very friendly professor who wants you to succeed.\"",

Instead of teaching synchronous classes, Clarke just assigned us pre-made lectures from Yale's introductory political philosophy course which were online and available to the public. Don't get me wrong: I'm sure the Yale professor is highly regarded and more than competent. However, as Dartmouth students paying $75,000 in tuition annually, I would have expected to actually receive direct instruction from a Dartmouth faculty member. We did have weekly group discussions to summarize the readings and Yale lectures, which I found to be alright. That said, instead of asking broad questions that could have elicited greater participation, Clarke focused on more nuanced details, which made contributing to the classroom dynamic more difficult, especially for those not deeply versed in political philosophy. Overall, I wouldn't say Clarke is \"mean,\" but she definitely does not come across as pleasant and encouraging -- mostly through tone.

In my opinion this class would be much better if she focused less on the background of the philosopher, stopped talking for more than 3 seconds and allowed for more discussion and conversation. In terms of assessments, she gave reading responses that were a pain to write (she also switched the due date for them last minute screwing over what she claimed to be 15% of the class), 2 huge exams with the worst structure I have EVER experienced (they were too dependent on the readings and partial credits isn't a thing), and then one final paper ~5-7 which was not bad at all. I think as a professor she's sort of off putting making me not want to go to office hours, and she's extremely abrasive over email.

The defining feature of this course was its pace: where most colleges split political philosophy into ancient and modern, GOVT 6 covers Plato to Nietzsche (and beyond) in 10 weeks. This means that you need to read ~20-60 pages of dense philosophical writing between each class, and understand basic premises on your own.

But I know plenty of people were disappointed to have very little opportunity for writing (just 10 one-page journal entries graded for completion and one essay) and have so much determined by exams that required quote identification and paragraph-length short answers. In short, this class is pretty hefty, but Clarke keeps things simple and is a great lecturer and a brilliant academic. If you like philosophy, ideas, and reading, you'll get a ton out of this course; if not, you'll find it to be a slog.

Lots of class time is devoted to class discussion, but discussions will inevitably be dominated by the same few people. If you want an A, skim the reading and then go to office hours to ask Murphy about his ideas. Regurgitating Murphy\u2019s own ideas seems to be the key to success. My favorite anecdote from this class was going to office hours to discuss a personal essay that included a story from my own life and then having Murphy tell me I was misinterpreting my own story. In the course\u2019s defense, I will say this: the class is by far the easiest intro gov course in terms of workload. There are readings, three short essays, one optional revision, and NO final.\""

He is quite condescending and takes ten minutes to answer a question he could've answered in one. However, the class was a very minimal time commitment (attendance at only one hour of one of the 10a blocks was required) and getting the median is quite easy, so if all you're after is the credit, then go for it.\"",

You can get by skimming all of the readings, but knowing the main ideas/key terms ends up being important for the midterm. The workload isn't that bad, just the midterm went pretty into detail (especially from the lecture material) and you should write more for the response journals than you might think you need to. Brooks made the response journals sound quite casual but ended up telling a lot of people their responses needed to go more in-depth after we turned in a few. In general, you'll barely get any feedback and it's not super clear what Brooks wants/what will meet his expectations, but he is still a pretty understanding and approachable prof if you go to office hours.

The weekly readings are long, and you have to take good notes to do well on the midterm, which is all fill-in-the-blank questions. The weekly response journals are important, and you have to be very thorough to do well on them.

I was also pretty annoyed at the fact that we got absolutely no feedback on any of our assignments except for one journal throughout the term. After doing about three of them, Brooks gives you recommendations on how to improve moving forward. But that's it. No other communication from him in terms of where you stand in the class, and he really does not like to give tips/pointers on writing assignments because he believes it's part of the writing process.

The second half of the course (Global Economy, Environmental Issues / Climate Change, Humanitarian Interventions, the Developing World, and other topics) was more interesting because it was grounded in real-world applications. The final paper ties the course together decently well, and Prof. Brooks' podcasts are very well-done (though beware; although they are 20-30 mins, it takes a focused -- and fast-paced -- hour to take good notes on them). The synchronous discussion sections weren't that helpful, and the format of office hours this term was a little time-consuming (we had to wait a long time, but I could see him possibly moving to an appointment-based model). Prof. Brooks is a nice guy and great lecturer, but he doesn't give much feedback on student work. This can be tough for a first-year student, but this -- at least virtually -- may also be a class where it's hard to get below the median.

There is usually like 60ish pages of reading a week, 3 30-minute lectures to watch, and a Response Paper. We had an op-ed project and final paper. You get the readings on Thursday night, and the Response Paper is due Thursday morning. The readings can be a bit tedious and academic (they're very theory-based until the last few weeks) but the Response Papers are actually kind of fun to do. They're really your only interaction with Prof Brooks, outside of a 1 hour a week Zoom call where we ask questions of him. Only problem is Prof. Brooks doesn't give any scored feedback on the response papers, op-ed, or final paper, so I have no idea what my final grade will be.

Classes were almost entirely lecture-based except for maybe three times where he turned it into a discussion for part of the class. It's absolutely essential to do all of the readings and come to every class. You don't need to do them in preparation for each class, but because the midterm and final are fill-in-the-blank and short answers, you need to know the key points of every reading and class topic. The exams themselves aren't hard, but preparation takes up a lot of time if you have fallen behind. Other than the two exams, the remaining graded component is a short essay at the end of the term. My only critique of Brooks as a professor is that it seemed like he went out of his way to not get to know his students (like arriving to class a minute late and being the first one to leave, not learning any names) and we only got grades back for the first midterm.\"",

He doesn't give you back your score on the second midterm or the final paper, so 60% of your grade is kinda up in the air until you get your final grade on DartHub. I took Writ 5 and CS 10 with Govt 5 this term, so Govt 5 ended up being my easiest course. I made practice exams by making my own fill-in-the-blank questions, and about 1/3 of them showed up almost verbatim on the exam. Though Brooks has a good sense of humor, he conveys his political attitudes a bit too explicitly. I think his belief that America is the world's largest superpower may have to change considering the US' ineffective treatment of COVID-19. But then again, he's a realist and probably had the same belief for several decades, so perhaps his thoughts remain unchanged.

This was mostly due to the structure of the midterm, which I found incredibly frustrating: it did not seem designed to test a student's actual understanding of the material as much as it seemed to test a student's ability to perfectly regurgitate lecture. I felt that I was heavily penalized on the exam because I had not developed silly pneumonic devices to remember the exact seven \"causes\" for something or other. Perhaps this was particularly bothersome for me because, having an understanding of the material, the natural way for me to study was not to memorize language and think of it almost as I would a math class (memorizing rules and spitting them out). I can understand how a student with less experience in the material might study in a way more conducive to doing well on that midterm. But it was incredibly frustrating for me, and I don't think it was because my prior understanding coupled with effort put into the course was somehow insufficient. I think it's telling that, after the exam, in order to try to understand some of the questions I was unsure of, when I asked a government major honors' student (one of six or seven, I believe) he didn't have the slightest clue how to answer those questions. I understand that there is a certain burden on the student taking the course to be more intimate with the immediate details and readings, but given that this is supposed to be an intro course, the fact that it does not seem to accurately reflect the knowledge base of one of the department's top students seems relevant. In explaining my frustrations to others, the most common responses I get are \"I hated Gov5\" or \"I hate intro classes.\" All in all, I was 1,000% sure that I would be a government major coming into Dartmouth. Now, I have severe reservations - the material is substantially less interesting to me and the way I have seen it taught at Dartmouth (which includes a high-level government class I took in the fall) is not consistent with the way I learn - or, to put it another way, I no longer feel this department is as strong as I once did.

Prof. Lebow is really enthusiastic and loves his topic, which is great. His lectures aren't too organized, but if you just listen it all makes a lot of sense, since he hits all major points multiple times in each lecture. Disorganized lectures usually drive me nuts, but his felt more like a narration, and weren't frustrating. He is very biased and opinionated, so just accept what he says with that in mind. Atleast he makes his bias blatantly clear, and allows dissenting voices to speak. I wasn't prepared for so many readings, some of which were dry and repetitive. In general, they were interesting supplements to the general ideas covered in class. I didn't keep up on the readings completely; so missed out on some interesting material and applications of the general ideas covered in lecture. However, the tests focus on the general ideas from lecture, and a solid understanding of those ideas and a few examples of the application of those ideas to countries is sufficient to do well on exams. Exams are very straightforward and seemed fair. Just answer the questions completely on a pretty basic level and you'll be fine. Overall it was a good course and I'm glad I took it. Lebow is really nice and enthusiastic and informed about the subject.\"",

He's a great speaker, and has lots of stories from his days working with the CIA, etc. He's a Cold War expert, which was good because he has all the inside information (from interviews, etc.), but bad because the Cold War inevitably became a focus of the class. We did get through the basics, but a lot of the readings were repetitive or filled with unncessary details. While the exams were perfectly fair, he's a somewhat odd grader - the points he awards for answers are a bit arbitrary. (There were two exams and a \"final paper\" -- basically two one-hour short essay tests, and one two-hour long essay.) However, he was very nice about grading, allowing students a chance to discard the worse of their two exam grades (many students did very poorly on the first midterm) - however, this means our final grades are determined by two grades. Overall, I'd say this is an interesting class. Those interested in IR will definitely enjoy it. However, it was entirely lecture (discussions were very limited). There weren't any interactive projects, like the nation-simulation some other Govy 5 profs do, which would have made the class a bit more relevant. I would probably recommend to definitely take Govy 5 (major or not), but maybe with a different prof.

In the end, I would recommend taking this course, but with one of the more experienced teachers (Wolforth and Press both made guest lectures and are really good) Also, it is possible, and quite likely, that Prof Lebow will get way better at this course.

Lebow the man, in general, is quite personable and helpful, worth talking to outside of class. His writing, from what I have seen of it, is equally engaging; there is some truth to the saying that clear writing is a consequence of clear thinking. That students consistently filled the lecture hall four days a week is a testament to Lebow's skills as orator and teacher. Judging from a lot of the readings assigned for the course, there are a lot of IR theorists out there who could stand to hire a writing tutor, or at least an editor. Still, their work nicely accentuated the ideas presented in lecture, and gave the student a good idea of the debates in contemporary IR research. What struck me personally was the shallow, repetitive, and unscientific nature of many of the articles (a common malaise in the social \"sciences\"). They examined isolated historical examples and extrapolated tremendous, unwieldly generalities from insufficient evidence -- not much different at times from op-eds, except they liberally apply jargon in order to disguise their trivial natures. I longed for logic and order, and rarely found it. Such flaws in IR theory may be the source of many a misguided or irrational foreign policy.

He is obviously very brilliant, and his lectures were great (he does a very nice job of using a web site to make lectures, readings and relevant docs available); one fears he has too much on his plate. The class was huge. lebow lectures two out of three classes; the third is usually a q&a class, with students asking the questions. the questions are interesting when they pertain to either the readings or the lectures. The questions are stupid and annoying when either the russina girl in the front row askes them or when they are about what was on Good Morning America. Lebow's assignments are a lot of reading. he gives a midterm (this term, do to overall \"disappointing grades\" the midterm did not count for the year unless the student so desired) and a final (or a final essay).\""

The exams involve a lot of memorization so be prepared to explain the concepts that you write down there. Valentino succeeds at combining his lectures with powerpoint slides that are fun and relevant. The readings aren't very long at all (~30 pages per class) and they dovetail very well, making them easier to remember. He gives pop quizzes on the readings, but if you've done them, you'll know the answers because they've usually appeared something like 10+ times in the readings. Valentino also does a simulation exercise (nuclear non-proliferation was ours) where students are grouped into different \"countries\" for negotiations on one Saturday. Valentino gives you the week off from class to substitute for this. This simulation, though it might not be perfect, definitely allows for active learning in an intro class, which is unusual.\"",

My advice is to do all the readings, go to all the lectures, and take notes that accurately reflect what he said in class and then repeat whatever he said on the exams. The simulation was time consuming, but not an extraordinary amount of work. You're not graded on it, and it doesn't affect your grade unless you completely do nothing or do something exceptional. There's a final paper thats about a third of your grade, but its short (1500 words) and not too bad.

The two midterms consisted mostly of memorizing and regurgitating the central arguments of the lectures/texts. The first was fill in the blanks and short answer, the second just short answer. The fill in the blanks was ruff since Valentino only accepted the EXACT phrase he wanted. The final paper required more original thought and harder - but not impossible.

Scripted lectures were decent/well-organized but sometimes sleep-inducing; dimmed lights and not-so-engaging powerpoints didn't help anyone stay awake. Tests are straightforward and fair and basically require memorization if not understanding.

The tests, however, were a different story. Each question was very directed, and was best answered in about a page. The problem was, Professor Valentino wanted you to write more than that. Besides that small problem, the course was great. I recommend it to majors and non-majors.\"",
            "review 28: \"05W with Benjamin Valentino: Government 5 encompasses a lot of topics: IR core theories, terrorism, weapons proliferation, economics, internal war, the environment, the spread of democracy, etc. Some of the readings, particularly most of the economics ones, are dry, but they're easily outweighed by a lot of interesting, thought-provoking ones. The reading lengths and difficulties vary greatly, from 6 pages to 60, easy to thick, but the class in general is never too time-consuming. Professor Valentino is very organized. His scripted lectures are accompanied by PowerPoint presentations, and are always very informative and interesting; they focus on and expand particular parts of the readings with historical facts, pictures, graphs, etc. A handful are entertaining (especially the nuclear proliferation one), but the strength of the majority is instead being interesting. Alas, with a bit over 100 students, there's no discussion, and while Prof. Valentino might know many of our faces, he knows only a handful of our names. While more of an interactive class setting may make the classes more fun, it cannot be done, but frankly is unnecessary to get the job done and teach the material. Go to class. You should, or your grade will suffer in several ways. First, he gives pop quizzes throughout the term to encourage attendance and keeping up with the readings. It rewards responsibility, since the more diligent students would do the readings and attend class anyway. Quizzes are worth 5 points each: 4 points for putting down the right (and usually ridiculously easy and obvious) answer, and 1 point for putting down your name. So even if you skim the readings you'd probably get the answer right. As for the tests, we had two midterms: one in the middle of the term, and one at the very last possible day roughly 1-2 weeks before the last day of classes. While extremely straightforward, Prof. Valentino likes short essay questions to be perfect to receive full credit; as he says, he's very stingy with the last 2-3 points on every such question. Alas, when your test consists of five of them, a 90 isn't too hard to come by even when you feel you have the material down pat. Tests allow some latitude, for he never asks you to answer every question; he follows the \"every question but one\" rule: if there are two parts, you'll be allowed to skip one question from each part. The final paper encompassed all the readings we did throughout the term, including the ones assigned after the last midterm. The question was very broad and difficult to answer given the 1,500-word cap and that some parts were much easier to answer than others. It's given during finals period, and in my opinion, harder than the midterms since due to its lack of direction and preparedness that I felt compared to the tests. The Arms Control Simulation took place during the last third of the term, right before our second midterm. This activity fully utilizes our large class size, as Prof. Valentino broke up our class into many countries: USA, UK, France, Russia, China, NK, SK, Japan, India, Pakistan, Libya, and Israel. When it came to nuclear nonproliferation, some countries were definitely able to play much bigger parts than others, as the US was bogged down with responsibilities, NK & Russia were big focal points, and Japan played a minor role. Fortunately Prof. Valentino tries very hard to encourage deception amongst the students and between the countries to maximize their countries' profits and screw over others'. While it's very easy to slack off, it's a lot of fun to be one of those evil people. Although he's only taught the class at Dartmouth twice now, Professor Valentino knows what he's doing and sets off to accomplish his job well. You are bound to learn many things about world affairs and their causes, and leave the course having been fascinated by many readings. Add to that one of the less common distribs, and it's definitely a worthwhile course.\"",

            "review 33: \"05W with Benjamin Valentino: Valentino is the best professor (albeit, out of 6) that I have had so far. He really strives to show all the main points of view and his lectures are amazing. His examples are clear, concise, and often very creative. For example, on our nuclear proliferation lecture he started his PowerPoint presentation with a picture of a fishing boat. Later in the lecture he used this seemingly innocuous picture to demonstrate just how easy it is to transport WMDs: a fishing boat. Why would North Korea trust its unreliable missiles to attack the U.S. with a nuke if it could just deliver the nuke on a relatively small fishing boat, since less than 2% of shipping cargo is inspected even superficially? It\u2019s examples like these that serve as real eye-openers and show you just how complicated IR is. The simulation is also a really important and lots of fun. We got to play representative parties of 9 different nations in nuclear proliferation talks (Which Kofi Anan happened to hold in the granite New Hampshire at Dartmouth). Each country\u2019s delegation tried to negotiate according its national interests (NOT JUST, \u201cHEY, WHY CAN\u2019T WE ALL JUST SHARE OUR NUKES AND HUG?\u201d), so some countries (ejem, NPRK) were more manipulative and subversive while other (i.e., Japan, Britain) focused more on diplomacy. People took it really seriously, so even some spying took place. At the end, the results were surprising and taught a lot, because uncoordinated, unfocused negotiations often lead to manipulation, and the countries you least expected of questionable actions played the system like a slot machine. The rest you can find out for yourself. The tests were relatively straight forward. His tests usually include a mix of fill in the blank, i.e., name four out of the 5 main principles of realism (a sentence or incomplete phrase is fine) and short answers (10-12 sentences). The test questions cover a combination of lectures and readings, so you will definitely have to know both well. I suggest STUDY GROUPS, i.e., splitting up the readings so that each person will do a short review for their section. That way, you write a summary for your 50-90 pg section and then have 10-20 pages of summaries total to study and not 350 pages of reading to cover for the tests. Nonetheless, it is good to highlight and even write short notes in your readings, because the final paper is usually a topic that could cover any or all of the readings (you don\u2019t have to do outside research for the paper, but its short 5 page length means you have to be very focused and concise, which, from this review, you can tell that I am not). TAKE THE COURSE!\"",

She uses a flipped classroom model, so we didn't have class on Mondays but had lecture videos to watch from home. DO NOT SKIP THESE. The videos are super important and where she explains what you really need to know. On Wednesdays and Fridays we had discussions in class which were very interesting and low-stakes.

She doesn't test on obscure things from the readings that she doesn't go over in class.

We also had two midterms and a final paper (30% each). The midterms are totally manageable if you pay attention and study but aren't out of a ton of points so you have to really know your stuff to get an A.

Dicussions sometimes got off track but Lind always did a good job dealing with it. WATCH THE LECTURES, everything on the lecture is fair game for the tests and the readings are mainly used to highlight takeaways from the lectures. Bit of a strict grader on essays and selective point deductions on tests, but writing in as simple of language possible is your friend. Overall, Lind was incredibly down to earth and rewarded interest in the class, participate during discussions and go to office hours with actual questions and she'll love you. Lind has also become super popular in the think tank circuit and has a book coming out on the rise of China, so expect her to be a good relationship to build if you're interested in East Asia/China work.\"",

The midterm and final weren't that hard but there wasn't much room for error. The readings were lengthy some weeks, but sometimes weren't essential. With the paper, I went to OH and talked through my outline with Lind and I wrote according to her feedback and got a good mark; so I would say, write how she wants you to and you'll be fine. She was pretty accomodating with exam times and deadlines for the whole class, and I really enjoyed the course itself. We covered a lot of material at the beginning of term but it kind of relaxed a bit by the end of term once you had a decent understanding of the underlying concepts.

I found the most effective method was watching the video lectures and then reading only the authors she referenced in the lecture. The discussion was held with the whole class of 40 people, making it not too difficult to keep up. She loved bringing up her work in China studies. The course's most important concepts are covered in the first few weeks before the midterm; after it, things get more relaxed. Also, there were weekly reading assignments, papers, and study groups set up by Lind.

She clearly explained all of the main points in the class, and then reinforced them again and again until it was impossible for anyone not to understand them. We covered a broad range of topics but she kept everything within the perspective of international politics, so I never thought anything we covered was superfluous. There is a lot of reading usually for every class, and while some of it is unnecessary and never seen again in class or on tests, the majority added to my understanding of the topic at hand. Many people complain about how we never went in depth on topics in class because of how much we had to cover, but if you do all the readings then you can learn the details that the lectures don't include. Between the in-depth readings and Lind's clarifying and easy-to-follow lectures, I feel like I have a very solid foundation in international politics. I can't imagine a more effective intro class on IR, and what it may have lacked in not having a world class prof, it made up in just teaching me the basics of IR. Timing is everything, and if I would have taken gov 5 a few years from now I guarantee I would have hated it. Its a big intro class with little discussion and fairly basic material, and even as a freshmen I was annoyed by certain other freshmen that always took up class time with innane questions or rambling answers that held things up. But overall I think it was a great course to ease me into Dartmouth and the gov department, never giving me much stress but also teaching me valuable information.

Professor Lind was, to say the least, not my favorite teacher. She gave her lectures along with a powerpoint, which is helpful for note-taking. However, she certainly has favorites for students and will continue calling on them during class while ignoring the majority of the students.

A word of warning about the lectures: Coggins puts up her slides on Blackboard, but they do not have much information on them. While I agree with her philosophy, I think this and her teaching style did make it hard sometimes to identify what was important in the lectures. Sometimes I was confused about whether she was just taking an incidental digression, or actually making an important point. The readings are reasonable, not too large and not too technical.

The first test tends to be a bit hard because you don't quite know what to expect, but just make sure you've read the readings and taken notes. What I recommend is highlighting as you read and then going back and writing a summary (in whatever format you like) of what you just read. You will read a ton of different works, so having that compilation of summaries can help you orient yourself as you study for the exams. After each class, take some time to look at the notes you just took and see how much you can remember and explain. That will help for exams as well.

As long as you do the readings and really understand each sides of theory and what the authors are discussing, you'll be fine. There are two midterms and a final paper. The midterms aren't bad as long as you pay attention and take good notes in class, and do all the readings. I highly recommend Professor Powers to anyone interested in taking this course.\"",

We started with theory for the first few weeks and then moved into applications, like the Iraq War, the Rwandan Genocide, apartheid, global environmental policy, and a bunch of other things. Prof. Powers also showed us a diagram of the class structure at the beginning of the class and checked in with it whenever we moved onto a new section. The class was really well organized and there were plenty of moments to discuss the topic in small groups, and Canvas posts were made available if you preferred not to contribute in class or if you had something longer to say. The midterms were straightforward and Powers sent us memos before each midterm spelling out what she wanted from us. She also passed around candy during the midterms which was really cute! The final was a 5 page paper double-spaced, so you need to be more concise than your average English argumentative paper. I regret not being able to go to office hours but I still felt like Powers was super approachable and kind, so definitely take this class with her!\"",

Prof. Powers does put emphasis on in-class participation and weekly discussion posts. These discussion posts are work that some other GOVT 05 professors might not require.

As the term came to an end I immediately looked to see what classes she was scheduled to teach in the future! The class, as expected, is reading heavy but it is very manageable with other non reading heavy classes. The first half of the class established a strong foundation of basic government ideas/theories/terms for someone new to the gov department and then we applied these ideas in the second half of the class to real world events. We had two tests which were completely fair if you answer the guiding questions for the reading and take minimal notes in class. Lastly, we had a final essay about any topic you wanted which is both exciting and overwhelming at the same time. Overall, would 10/10 recommend! A traditional workload with a passionate and approachable prof in a comfortable environment!\"",

If you have the option of choosing between professors, take it with Powers. Even if you don't, wait a term to take it with Powers. She is incredibly passionate about teaching and creates a class environment that makes participation (which is 8% of the grade) easy, even in a class of 40. If you don't like talking in class, you can post on Canvas discussion boards. She's super fun to talk to in office hours and will answer any question about the class with full transparency. Her transparency is one of the best things about how she runs the class. The reading questions are literally the only study guide you need for the tests. If you do them before every class, participation will be a breeze. The worst part of this class is the readings. There are a lot of readings and they take a lot of time, especially if you're new to gov classes. There is a lot of academic jargon that is hard to follow for the readings in the first half of the term. If you put your head down and do them, you will do well. Don't let this be a reason not to take the class though. All the readings are incredibly interesting and you will learn how to analyze state behavior in the international system.\"",

Going to his office hours didn't help. Some people in this class loved it, and loved Walker, but I'm not one of them.

It doesn't relate much to current events, but the patterns and theories you study will help you gain new perspectives on current events if you do some thinking. About the work: Read the \"questions to consider\" on the syllabus because they're mainly what's important, but be aware that doing the readings will help you in class. There are only six reading quizzes per term and only four of them count (he grades pass-fail and if you get four right then you get 100% on RQs). Start the papers ahead of time and go to office hours. Mainly, this course is fine if you keep up with the readings and concepts. Try and wrangle the study guide for the midterm and final from Prof Walker ahead of time. Mostly, GO TO OFFICE HOURS because Prof Walker has some interesting perspectives. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Office hours may not end up being about the assignments persay but the prof's got some intriguing things to say about his subject. STUDY AHEAD OF TIME. Honestly, that's the basic one thing to do in this course. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CRAM AT THE LAST MINUTE and you'll be absolutely fine. Cramming might work partially but you'll end up working so, so much harder than you could have. Just study in advance! Prof Walker is good but he expects a lot of us, especially as first-term freshmen. The class size was supposed to be 25 but ended up at 55. Participate, pay attention, and study.

He is friendly and helpful to those who approach him- but you have to make a sincere effort. (Don't think that you'll get by with skipping class, though. He doesn't keep attendance, but he's very good with names and faces, contrary to what he says, and if you're not frequently in the class's ranks it will sour his opinion of you.)

His exam format is perfect because it is a very fair evaluation if you 1.study and 2. go to class you will do well. also, he gives very good lectures and real life examples of theories that might otherwise be boring Overall he makes the topics interesting, covers exactly whats in the reading and if you do the reading and listen in class you will be fine.

On a side note, he also gave pop quizzes, which got really annoying. Workload: The reading was inconsistent at times. It nonetheless was a relatively fair amount each night and didn't impede any progress in other subjects. Studying for exams was another matter. Rather than drawing from class lectures, Prof. Carey based his exams almost exclusively on the readings. In order to do well, one had to more or less memorize each paper's arguments and some of its specifics. I found this very infuriating. Though studying wasn't hard, it ended up taking awhile and ate into a lot of my time. Nonetheless, Gov 4 is certainly worth it if you're willing to put in the time.

The class is broken up into several sections, all of which deal with different aspects of government that relate to the broad questions of the course: what are the ideal conditions for democracy? is democracy the best form of government? There is also a section on electoral systems and voting methods. While the readings are all interesting, they are at times quite dense--many are studies that involve a lot of statistics that could be a bit overwhelming--and there can be up to 90 pages of reading from a Monday to Friday class. Carey also used a lot of the x-hours at the beginning of the term but expected us to read the same amount, even though we had only a day to do 30-50 pages of reading. And you have to do the reading. Carey gives pop quizzes on the readings that are difficult and DETAILED. They also prepare you for the exams, however, so take them seriously. They make up a significant portion of your grade, so you can only afford to really mess up one out of the nine or so you get (you can drop your lowest score). The course has two midterms, both of which have a multiple choice section and one-three essays. The multiple choice section has some broad concept questions mixed in with some VERY detailed questions that require you to have thoroughly read the articles. The final is cumulative but weighted towards the end of the class and is slightly longer than the two midterms. You're also required to write two 750 word Op-Eds by the end of the term (you can turn them in whenever). Because of the extremely short word limit these can actually be pretty challenging because you have to come up with an argument and support it convincingly in about 3 pages. However, they force you to apply what you're learning about theoretical things (like the collective action problem) to real-life politics and I really enjoyed writing them.

Although most people didn't like the quizzes, they served as a motivation to do the assigned readings and not fall behind. With the exception of one quiz (the one right after Thanksgiving recess), all of the quizzes were fairly easy if you had read the material. The material itself was mostly interesting. Although some of the articles that we read in class got repetitive at times, they kept my attention. Only one of the required readings, Shepsle and Bonchek's Analyzing Politics, was dry, boring, and dense. Fortunately, Carey explained the material in that book extremely well. I also really liked the fact that the material developed as the course progressed. Each reading led in to the next reading very smoothly. I felt that the course was very well designed. The midterms and final are a pain to study for because there is so much material covered in the class. Fortunately, Carey posts all of his lectures online and you can use them as your main study tool. Most of the questions on the exams are fair, but sometimes he'll ask you to recall random tidbits of information that are pretty irrelevant to the course material. Each exam includes a short answer (multiple choice) component and an essay or two. The exams aren't too hard if you study for a few hours the day before. Professor Carey asks his students to submit two Op-Eds at any point during the course. I HIGHLY recommend turning the first one in early so that you can see what he looks for (he'll write comments). You can write about almost any topic or country (as long as it involves politics outside of the US). All in all, this class with Professor Carey was excellent.

He's friendly-ish, never yells or anything like that (brings candy on halloween, plays music clips someitmes)... but MY GOD. I honestly can't say I was really interested in anything he had to say after the first class or two. He seems really energetic at first, but then you realize that he's actually rambling about things that don't make anything in the readings clear. And the readings, mind you, are pretty bad (except for Zakaria -- which was pretty good, but everything goes downhill from the first 2 classes or so). Also, I don't really think this class, in terms of material, is at all interesting... it's all theory-based, which I wasn't expecting, making it all VERY DRY and rather hard to grasp. He also brought in a lot of game theory type stuff which I really didn't sign up for... So Carey seems nice (though he's one of those really exact by-the-book types with a bit more of an edge)... but I never managed to stay entirely awake in any of his lectures. Also, he gives POP QUIZZES on the reading which is REALLY BAD because you can't fall behind at all... and frankly I thought they were sometimes really annoying about stupid details that I couldn't remember because I read all the material at 3 AM etc... (come on, I know you'll do that a few times too). The 2 midterms weren't terrible but they're a PAIN TO STUDY for because Carey's lectures are useless, his Power Points suck (as in, can't serve as viable study aids), so basically you have to figure out what it is you want to remember from all the baaaaaaaad reading you have to do. The final for our section was much tougher than I expected (the other section got off easier on the essay apparently) and I didn't really feel like the effort I put into the class helped me out. You have to write 2 Op-Eds by the end of term, which aren't tooo bad, but are annoying anyway because the information needed to write them is hard to aquire if you're not extremely well-informed about all foreign countries. bottom line, if you KNOW FOR SURE you want to major in gov, and you really don't want to take one of the other Intro's, I guess you could take this class, but be prepared: you might not dislike it as much as I did, but I can tell you that I didn't know anyone who liked it a lot, loved it or felt inspired by it. If you're not sure about gov, spare yourself the trouble. I wasn't too sure about my major so I guess this class helped me realize I'm not interested enough to take a crappy intro and move onto the great upper classes (which are really good). I got a B, which I'm reallllly happy with considering how badly I thought I did on the final... All in all, I don't recommend this class... at all.\"",

The same goes for the essay: the professor clearly states that she does not want any outside research, so all the information you need is in the material covered in class. To top it off, all these assignments are graded very, very leniently. Having said that, if you want to learn things from a knowledgeable and effective teacher, don't take this class. This professor is incredibly underprepared and disorganized. On more than several occasions, Prof. Baldez would apologize for her lecture slides omitting relevant material, being outdated, confusing names and dates, etc., because she had \"just made the slides last night.\" On the night before the first midterm, she blitzed the class to say that she had forgotten to include, on the syllabus, an article that she had put on the midterm.

Sometimes it was bad enough to make me question her scholarship. As far as the grades go, there is a mid-term, a paper, pop-quizzes (of which you drop the lowest grade), and a final. The midterm and final are full of moderately hard to soft-ball questions that she grades extremely leniently (I got full credit for a question answered objectively wrong on more than one occasion). Read the book and you'll be safe in the 90s percentage-wise. The quizzes are 5 questions, one of which is your name; the rest are split between multiple choice and single-word or very short answer. The timing of the quizzes is fairly easy to predict and they just focus on the major parts of the readings you had to do the night before (when you're done reading the articles, ask yourself what the big questions are; those will be the quiz questions). The paper is short and easy to do, although Baldez demonstrates in a grading exercise she makes everyone do, her ineptitude when it comes to grading: often mistaking bad writing for good, and valid points for invalid ones. Grading here is a crap-shoot, just sound intelligent and you'll do fine. Of the government classes I've taken so far, this is one of the most interesting in terms of subject matter.

She often seemed unprepared for her lectures and quite often commented on how she wrote her PowerPoints late the night before or that very morning, and it showed when she would randomly say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh, woops, I should delete that slide.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Although the in-class discussions were insightful at times, often it seemed that she was just trying to fill time, as her lectures rarely lasted the entire class period. When the lectures did take the entire class period, however, it was often because she had spent too much time with creative class-participation exercises at the beginning of class and was thus rushed to get to the real material at the end, causing only further confusion and frustration. The tests and essays were overall fair, and although the detail asked for in the first quiz was a bit of a surprise (there were multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short answer, as opposed to the multiple-choice-only practice quiz), I found the quizzes (2 in total, each worth 7.5%) to be a fair test of reading and lecture knowledge. However, her essay grading (2 essays, a Locke/Marx essay worth 20% and an essay on Mexican democratization worth 15%) to be inconsistent, as she was very critical on the first essay and much more relaxed on the second. The essay grading exercise (in which we took one essay from the stack and made comments on it, gave it a grade, and gave it to the teacher to give back to the student) was helpful in looking at different strategies of approaching the topic, and it helped that our comments didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect the grade she gave the essay. She also had us go to any IR/Comparative politics-related lecture and write a 2 page, double-spaced critique (worth 10%). This was also a useful exercise that got, especially freshman, to go out and see some of the amazing lectures and debates Dartmouth holds free for students and the local community. The final was worth 35% and was not very long, with about 35 total questions (multiple choice, fill in the blank, define terms), and a long essay comparing all of the case studies we had done. I found that I actually understood the case studies better after that test, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it was well-written. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent class, and a good alternative to govt 6 (political philosophy) for a pre-requisite to the major, although Baldez sometimes babied us too much (taking attendance while not counting participation for a grade, making us sign in our essays when our essays already had our ID number on them) and showed a clear liberal leaning. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m liberal, but even I got tired after a while of her talking about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, wishing she would have had a wider variety of examples.

In terms of the midterm/final, people did \"unusually well\" on the midterm so he graded the final harder, but that's unlikely to happen again.

I think the worst moment was meeting with him during office hours alone (always go with a partner!). Though he invited us to come in and ask questions, he mocked my \"belligerent\" nature and mistook my asking questions about my exam as personal attacks on his exam. \"Are you going to argue another one, huh?\" \"You really like to argue don't you.\" \"NO! How did you not pick up on this! I said it like every day in class!\" Horowitz needs a serious attitude adjustment. Making fun of a freshman with, at the time, a genuine interest in Government and making me feel bad about engaging in critical thinking via asking questions seriously does not adhere to Dartmouth values.

There is about 35-40 or so pages of reading assigned for each class meeting (with some historical readings occasionally that are longer but that we can read more quickly / holistically), so make sure to allot at least 3-4 hours (or longer, if you're a slow reader like me). Prof. Horowitz goes over the readings well in class but you still need to do them in order to do well on his exams.

Dr. Becker was by far the most boring lecturer I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had on this campus. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read from his lectures, but clearly makes no effort to make them as palatable as they possibly can become. As a History major, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found professorial outlines written on the board before class (and then scrupulously followed by the professor) as methods conducive to lectures that are both interesting and understandable. Not once did Dr. Becker venture to write an outline, especially given the fact that at least a few of us were not GOVT majors amenable to the techno-babble-laden nature of Government courses. His exams were awful, in the respect that they asked questions whose very nature demanded that you already have an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intuitive idea\u00e2\u20ac\u009d over the outlines of the lectures (which he did not give) and therefore could have named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the two certain of this\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four methods/characteristics\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of that. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse, there is absolutely no choice; for both the final and midterm you are required to do all the questions. There is no way out if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done anything less than 95 percent of the reading. Only the paper was graded fairly, and in an odd sort of way, the non-majors probably did better than the majors, who probably got so enamored with their own GOVT expertise that they placed too much emphasis on advanced concepts not congenial to material on Comparative Politics, precisely when Dr. Becker only want an analysis of a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political institutions in the context of liberal democratic ideals based only on some very basic materials solely taught in the course and not elsewhere.

If you do not find learning about the internal politics and governmental institutions and policies (political, economic, and social) of different countries interesting or enjoyable, then this course is probably (or even clearly) not for you. The grade for the term in this course was based on two exams during the term (one more or less mid-term and the other in the second-to-last week of term) that together composed 60% of the final grade (30% each), one final paper (20%), and class participation and attendance (20%). Although the final grade was based on relatively few grades, I found Prof. Vandewalle's grading policies to be fair. Professor Vandewalle is an extremely engaging, knowledgeable professor who is more than willing to discuss class material and other aspects of comparative politics, etc. at length outside of class with individual students, despite his often-busy schedule. He plans his lectures well, in them elucidating the main points of the assigned readings and bringing in his own and other perspectives on the topics at issue. Although Prof. Vandewalle is a highly effective lecturer, the fact that the class was a 9L this term, I think, detracted substantially from the energy in the room. I am not a fan of the 9L time slot, but if this class is offered in the future at the 9L to be taught by Prof. Vandewalle, I would recommend it highly nonetheless. The material in the course as taught by Prof. Vandewalle focuses first on the fundamentals of comparative politics and then on four case studies: the Middle East (primarily Libya, one of Prof. Vandewalle's specialties), Russia, China, and India. The democracy-authoritarianism dichotomy and institutionalization are major themes throughout the course. Perspectives from political economy are often highlighted. My main (merely minor) complaints about this course were: (1) that it was taught at the 9L, not a good time for us college students generally; and (2) that the case studies did not include a Western state (i.e. France, Germany, the U.K., or even Mexico, a state that is now studied often in the field of comparative politics).

            "review 1: \"08F with Richard Winters: Upon entering this course, I thought that it would an in-depth version of a typical AP United States Government class, but that was not the case. Thankfully, it was assumed that students already had extensive background knowledge of United States government, which allowed the course to take a theoretical approach to examining United States politics. This theoretical approach was strictly an empirical one with a narrow focus, solely exploring why participants in the political system act the way that they do, not on the benefits or downsides of particular features of the American political system. This theme was conveyed through daily readings of old political science works, almost all of which implemented utilitarian and economical models to explain the entire political framework of the United States in terms of self-interested, rational strategic decision making. The course itself was not a particularly difficult one. One single-page, single-spaced essay was due each week, which could be written on any one of a number of topics that Professor Winters selected. Additionally, there were three exams, not one of which was cumulative, including the final exam. Personally, I rarely read the readings more than a few days in advance of the three exams, but managed to effectively learn the material and completely destroy each of the tests. Participation in class is optional; in fact, I rarely, if ever, participated, and I did just fine. However, be aware: about five of the students in the class dominated all of the discussion, asking pointless, unrelated questions under a thin guise of great verbiage, probably just to show off to the professor. While this was at times very amusing and/or laughable, particularly when a few of them physically shook with anticipation of getting to make unnecessary comments praising President-elect Obama, it was often merely annoying. Professor Winters has a clear interest in what he teaches and is always ready to share his enthusiasm. Although his writings on the board and his unusual short-hand abbreviations for different terms are hardly discernable, his amusing and infamous tangents manage to make up for them. While Winters does have an observably left-leaning political stance, it does not unfairly impact those in the course with different views. Overall, The American Political System is a solid introductory course, but nothing to get too excited about.\"",
            "review 2: \"08F with Richard Winters: Prof. Winters has no structure in his lectures and bases the entire class on whatever he thinks is important in the New York Times that day. That's great, but the tests reflect the reading, nothing of what he says in the lectures! There is an incredible amount of reading and most is incredibly boring. Other than the few staple pieces of poli sci literature, Winters has just chosen readings that are way out of date and many that he never talks about and are not on the test. When he creates his tests, he tries to find the most obscure term and then even if you know it, he takes off points without any explanation. He was useless in office hours and a very strange grader. For grading papers, he just underlines random words and phrases and you get a grade with no justification. This can be good or bad because if you get an A on the first paper, then you pretty much get an A on every paper. Likewise with a B. Avoid taking this class and ask Winters to retire :)\"",

He also helps you out by narrowing down the list of what you are expected to know for each test.

They usually involved about 12 short answers, many of which did not reflect basic understanding of the articles but rather arbitrary knowledge of random things mentioned in the articles.

On top of this, Winters is GREAT. He has a hilarious sense of humor and clearly is very passionate about his subject, a passion that makes the class exciting and is contagious.

He constantly allowed the class to become a series of (rarely enlightening) discussions without any direction, which made it difficult to sit through class, much less get anything out of it. While his tendency for tangents and discussion was exacerbated by the election season, it seems that it would have occurred anyway. Furthermore, he required weekly two-page papers (well, one page single-spaced) on the reading and would only blitz out the questions for the papers 24 hours in advance. The questions weren't usually that hard but they required you to do the reading and having to write once a week was difficult. I was interested in the material, enjoyed some readings, and occasionally found Winters entertaining but it didn't make up for the majority of the lack of real lectures and the weekly papers.\"",

The midterms and final are fair and really short which is nice. Take this class if you want to learn a lot about government, mainly through reading and somewhat through lecture.

Most of the reading he assigns was annotated sometime in the 1970s and thus doesn't show up very well when you print it out.

She teaches exclusively from Powerpoints, which either convey arbitrary information that you will not be tested on or reiterate the more obvious points in the textbook. Though a class of fifty people is small enough to learn through led discussions, Brooks opts instead to use Powerpoint, usually disengaging the class and leaving the majority wishing they had not bothered to attend. Her Powerpoints are never made available online, however, and the suspicion that she would sneak something novel from them onto a test (such as the Mid-term, which featured 13 arbitrary fill-in-the-blank questions)was the only thing that prompted students to continue to show up. The paper (worth 30%) was on a topic distantly related to our readings and what we had been discussing in class, and was not graded in time for us to receive it before the Final. The Final essay was also on an extremely broad topic, one you would probably be able to sufficiently answer without having gone to class or even done most of the readings. The readings were perhaps the biggest problem with the class. I took a class on the American Government again because I felt that I had learned little from my junior-high Civics class, and that at Dartmouth, I would be presented with a plethora of new, objective material that would allow me to formulate my own opinions on aspects of the government and on political topics relevant to the day. Instead, the material was, without exception, ultra-liberal; only one side was presented for every issue. I do not affiliate with one political party or the other, but I resented the biased material that we were assigned to read daily. The 'textbook' was informative, but was interlaced with Democratic propoganda that added nothing to the text. The fact that the book was written by Samuel Jacobson, a huge proponent of the Democratic party, should have been clue enough. The O'Connor book is worth reading, and introduces the class to a variety of notable political science scholars and some of the most famous essays on the government ever written. The David E. Price Congress book must be purchased from an outside source (it is not sold on campus), and is not worth buying. The quantity of readings is manageable, but can get difficult, especially on Tuesdays, given the fact that Brooks assigns the same amount of work between Tues/Thurs as she does between her Thurs/Tues classes. All in all, I did learn a variety of useful information from Gov 3 (mostly the textbook). I don't think that Brooks adds anything special to the class, but think that her 'Polling and Public Opinion' class could conceivably be interesting, given her knowledge on the subject and assuming that she does not teach that class exclusively from Powerpoint as well. The class, despite my complaints, was relatively easy, and the subject matter is generally pretty interesting. There are worse classes you could take at Dartmouth than Gov 3 (Vampires and Firebirds, anyone?), and probably worse Profs out there than D. Brooks. It's up to you.\"",

I have to say, I'm biased because I took AP Gov't but I got a four. Thus, I had to sit through all this material that I already knew listening to Prof. Brooks go on and on about how she went to Yale and how she worked at Gallup. On top of that there were the regular government douches who never shut up. Take it if you need it, but don't take it with her.\"",
            "review 15: \"06W with Deborah Brooks: For someone unfamiliar with how the American government ticks (esp. international students), there's a plethora of information to learn. But for a govt major and/or someone fairly knowledgeable of current events, the class has trouble fulfilling its true potential. The course appeals most to the least common denominator - those who know barely anything about the American government. But for others (namely people who are born here), a good portion of the class is devoted to learning about how a bill becomes a law, the three branches of government, civil rights, civil liberties, etc. Even for someone who never took AP Government, I found myself repeating a lot of what I had learned through social studies classes throughout high school. The class shines the most when focusing on specific, relevant topics. Getting a taste of Professor Deborah Brooks' passion, public opinion, entices many a student to want to take that mid-level course. Getting to know more about Congress members on an individual level through a) an autobiography and b) two visiting ex-Congress members was truly an enlightening experience. Producing 30-second ads, albeit time-consuming, is nevertheless an enjoyable experience that flexes your political consulting skills. Her short-answer midterm is the trickiest part of the course. Ample studying guarantees an appropriate grade that's relatively much higher than the class median/average. The questions are specific, but never too nitpicky. The answer that required a paragraph-long response was surprisingly simple. It seems that the more we had to write in the assignments, the broader they got. The paper asked us to argue for or against a particular topic, allowing us much leeway for responses. The final was extremely disappointing. It was easy, broad, poorly developed, requiring us to laundry-list our way to an appropriate response. While naturally all three branches are covered, in the assignments, lectures, and readings, Professor Brooks showed a ridiculous bias towards the legislative branch. I think it was rather fortunate since it's the branch that's often given the least exposure, and she did a good job teaching us about it. It also helps if you ever plan to go intern for a Congress member. When compared to the other government intros I've taken, I must say that this had the poorest quality. If it were more in-depth, focused on more particular topics, and dropped the HS recaps, it would succeed more in enticing the students. If you're looking for an easy government course, then this is by far takes the cake. If you're looking for an interesting, worthwhile one, try another. On a side note, I keep hearing Deborah Brook's intro is atrocious, while her Public Opinion course is amazing, so only take this course if you have to. If you want a better Brooks course, go with Public Opinion.\"",

The beginning starts out a little slow, talking more about the Constitution/Founding Fathers, but then the class picks up when you get to more modern, relevant topics, such as interest groups and lobbying. I'm not a fan of the essay tests -you have one or two short answers, which require a very specific answer from a randomly selected reading or chapter from the textbook. These can be a little rough because you can do a lot of prep, but happen to miss what she asks. The longer essay (worth the bulk of the points) is much more general, however, and lets you draw in a lot of your knowledge from lecture/readings and show off what you have learned.

The paper and the majority percentage on both exams are very general, completely encompassing questions.

The class is set up so that it's lecture-based 2 classes per week and then a class discussion over a given topic on Fridays. There are 10 lecture/discussion topics, 1 per week, and you have to write an essay to be brought to discussion on 2 of those weekly prompts (your choice). The good thing about that is that you can see all the promots at the start of the course and plan ahead on which ones you'd be interested in writing about. One problem I had that with this course that decently affected my experience in the class: Lacy is a game theory guy and would include it in lectures and tests -- and an alarmingly large portion of the midterms was focused on game theory and voting mechanism theorems that adversely affected many people's grades. I felt it was not explained clearly in class, had little to do with the rest of the course material and was NOT advertised in the course description.

He did not miss a class the entire term, contrary to other reviews, and he only occasionally used the X-hour. I loved every second of this class, and while there is about 50-60 pages of reading each week, it is incredibly manageable if you stay on top of things. Take this class with Lacy. We just had our last class and I miss it already. Grading wise, the class is very manageable - the median on one of our exams was a 92. There are two cumulative exams throughout the quarter, worth 20% and 25% respectively. Each week, Lacy offers a few discussion questions based on the week's focus that students can write papers on. You must write two papers throughout the course of the term but you can choose any two weeks to write them, depending on what interests you. Topics range from US foreign policy to Medicare-for-all to the Electoral College. These two papers are also worth 20 and 25% of the grade respectively. The last 10% of the grade comes from occasional weekly quizzes that cover in-class material and textbook readings. These quizzes are very manageable if you take good notes and revise before the class, and all of our quizzes were open-note and online. Once again, Lacy is awesome.

Let me give you some anecdotes: [1] Before the first midterm, a peer raised their hand and said \"you have given us about a thousand pages of reading, but we have talked about maybe 10% of it in class. what do we need to know?\" and Lacy said, with a straight face, \"all of it.\" [2] A large portion of your grade is decided by a group project. Instead of watching these groups present, Lacy spent his time during the presentations on his phone. More reasons why the class is terrible-- [1] the readings were horrendous - want to read a 300 page book on \"what is a state?\" interested in completing a 150 page reading on the formation of political parties in the US? and most importantly, have Lacy tell you this is going to be on the test and then not be tested on it? this class is for you. [2] Lacy is oddly obsessed with the math behind voter preference. It got SO bad that Lacy would be drawing diagrams with points and lines and polygons and numbers on the white board and no one had a clue of what was going on. This theory was also not backed up by any papers so it wasn't like you could take your own time to figure it out.

A lot of it is interesting though and you can get away with skimming some parts. He occasionally gives pop quizzes based on the reading (we had in total 4 I think) but all of them together plus participation/attendance only count as 5% of your final grade. There were 2 tests- a midterm and a final- each worth 25% of your grade. They weren't super difficult, but you have to put in a good amount of time reviewing your class and reading notes to do well. He also lets the class vote at the beginning of the term whether to make them closed or open note and in class or on canvas.

The midterms in particular were not difficult at all - a few fill-in-the-blanks, short answer identification, and one or two essays.

We had two tests and two 2-page response papers, all of which were easy and the course was not stressful at all. The reading is somewhat substantial but if you don't get behind it is managable.

Indeed, there wasn't much new for me in the curriculum or the readings, but by virtue of Prof. Lacy, I learned a surprising amount. Prof. Lacy is highly responsive to student comments and questions both in and out of class, one of the best profs I've had in terms of responsiveness. He allows the class to go on tangents quite frequently, but they're always relevant tangents that students don't seem to mind, either related to the day's lecture, a future lecture, or related material. He grades a little too easily, I think, and the final grade was based on a midterm, a final, and two two-page papers - each two-pager was weighted the same as the final and midterm, which is a little disconcerting.

In short: each week, we had two class meetings \u2014 a big group with the prof., and a small one with four other kids. This meant that 100% of our learning came from assigned readings, which were interesting but not incredibly comprehensive. Most of our class discussions focused on tangential issues or current news, which is fair given that 2020 will go down as a notorious year in history, but it also meant that we didn't learn that much about American government.

To that end, he always said stuff like \"this is GOVT 3, not GOVT 300\" in reference to not expecting you to know a bunch, but then basically everything he said expected that you kept up with every little bit of political news. As somebody who is not intending on majoring in government, this was definitely a negative of the class.

The class discussions are super interesting, and the small group discussion/Canvas discussions always added to my understanding of materials.

There weren't any questions on either that I felt were too difficult or out of line with the material.

Basically, there is a paper, midterm, final, simulation, and discussions. The paper isn't too bad, and I think she's an average grader as long as you show that you are understanding the material. The midterm, again, was pretty decent. The lectures, I felt, helped with this because the questions were fairly simple. The simulation was fun, although our topic (Budget Proposal) made it a little difficult to get through successfully. The final is what killed me (counting for 50% of the grade)! She said it was cumulative over the entire course, so I spent 50% of the time looking over the first half of the course, when in all reality, the final was on the latter part of the course (and I didn't realize her final was only 2 hours and not the typical 3).

He made the exams all short answer, recall questions (write a word/phrase/list/sentence at most). They were really easy, but you do have to memorize a LOT in case it comes up (I made a giant Quizlet), and there is a B+ median so you have to perform really well to get above the median.

He's a nice person, don't get me wrong, and I think taking a stats-type class with him might be better because maybe that's where his expertise is. But the lectures for GOV3 are MIND NUMBING. I'm not someone to fall asleep in lectures ever but I came very close on multiple occasions. He comes to class with a list of notes taken word-for-word from our online textbook (which is the ONLY source we ever read for this class) and reads off of it, word-for-word. I was frankly pretty astonished to find that a class at Dartmouth was taught like that. I learned some basic valuable information in this class that I never got in high school because I didn't take AP gov but the lack of critical thinking, debate, questioning or reconsidering of \"facts\" and ideas in this class was astounding. The textbook makes broad sweeping statement after broad sweeping statement about American culture and history and we were simply required to memorize these ideas for the multiple-choice tests. The worst part was that if you had a question about anything in the reading or the textbook, there was an 80% chance that the prof didn't know the answer. Seriously. And instead of admitting that he didn't know which amendment was which or which supreme court case dealt with what or how certain historical events transpired, he would pontificate about it, spouting various hypotheticals and theories, before finally concluding that he wasn't quite sure. This is clearly not his area of expertise. I learned early on that google was a much more reliable way to find a correct answer to any of my questions. So all in all, perfectly nice and understanding prof who may be great in other courses but did not make for much learning or intellectual stimulation in this one. My advice is take the class with someone else or don't take it at all, especially if you have AP gov under your belt.\"",

This class had so much wasted potential. We could have had interesting class discussions, listened to fascinating lectures, or done more work/assignments related to current events, but we did none of that. Instead, we read out of an online textbook outside of class, and then came to class and listened to the prof read off his notes WORD FOR WORD from the textbook. Class as such was an absolute waste of time and I would have stopped going after the first or second week had he not taken attendance at the beginning of every class. However, if you need extra time for other work or maybe online shopping, by all means enroll in the class. I bought some of my favorite pullovers during Bafumi lectures. I guess another saving grace was that there was almost no work required for this class. However, don't be fooled - this class is NOT a layup. Practically your entire grade comes from your midterm and your final. Our midterm had 100 multiple choice questions for one hour and the final was 200 mc for two hours. Many of the questions were also VERY subjective/debatable. The exams were online but closed book/notes, so you can imagine cheating may have been rampant. For a course where the median is supposed to be curved to a B+ (your grade may end up being a result of how your classmates score), this presents a real issue. He did end up giving our class an A- median because our scores were high, but he needed to get special permission to do so, and it seems likely he won't be inclined to violate the median policy multiple times so may be more strict in future years. The other part of your grade is participation, but how could he reasonably grade that when it didn't even appear he knew most people's names? There's almost NO transparency in how grades are calculated for this class. Let's say someone got a 90 on the midterm. Was that an A, A-, B+, etc.? I wouldn't know then and I still couldn't give you an answer because he never published the final grading scale. I wouldn't be as mad about the final grade if I felt I got something out of the class, but as someone who took AP Gov, or even as someone who's an informed American citizen, it's fair to say I learned almost nothing in this class. If you happened to be someone who needed help understanding the course material, though, good luck. Bafumi had no scheduled office hours and any time you would ask a question in class, you would almost never get a clear answer. Bottom line - AVOID THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN.\""

            "review 3: \"23W with Mia Costa: Professor Costa is really chill and interacts with the class. Definitely take this with her if you can. There were 3 exams, all equally weighted, that got progressively harder each time. Though, the final was ROUGH, to say the least. There are also 4 additional assignments that you grade yourself. The coursework is reasonable and interesting. Attendance isn't super important but she does throw some curveballs in the exams that are only mentioned in class. You don't really need to do the readings but review the final questions at the end of the chapters, she uses so many of those questions on the exams!\"",
            "review 4: \"23F with Mia Costa: Lowkey just kind of... mid? The biggest critique I have of this class is that, by the end, 60% of the total grade was still up in the air (final project + final + participation) which is really stressful going into the end of the term and studying for the final. The class is pretty much just AP Gov but for college students and it's really just memorization and regurgitation. I don't think I had to critically think at all for this class but it could've been worse I guess.\"",
            "review 5: \"19S with Mia Costa: If you've already taken AP US Govt. then it's a fairly easy class. Don't really have to do any of the readings. Even if you haven't taken AP govt., I highly recommend the class. Costa is an awesome prof...super nice and she's very into research, so she'll even share some interesting studies she's done. Also gets good guest speakers. Midterms are fairly straightforward. Last 2 were even take-home (but only have an hour to do them). Easy to get A-/A.\""

            "review 1: \"13F with Michael Herron: Very easy and straightforward class: one midterm and one final with short answer questions based on major concepts covered in lecture, and a few short, easy homework assignments. Herron has a very quantitative bend so you'll cover a little bit of median voter theorem and similar concepts, but beyond that it's basically what you'd expect out of an introductory American government course-- checks and balances, roles of the different branches, Constitution and state's rights, etc. Herron is a funny and engaging Professor, and the readings are more or less optional if you attend all the classes.\"",
            "review 2: \"04S with Michael Herron: As a Government major with a concentration in American Government, I expected this class to focus on American politics. However, Herron, while a very nice man who is actually a statistics professor, turned it into a class on game theory and statistics. The class moved slowly and was little work, but Herron made an interesting subject into something that was actually pretty boring.\"",
            "review 3: \"04S with Michael Herron: While this class was fairly easy (with an easy textbook and minimal assignments), Professor Herron made the topic of American Politics incredibly boring. As a statistics professor, he related almost everything to game theory and stats which did not fit the ORC description accurately. I definetly wish I had gotten more out of this class.\""

            "review 1: \"18F with Jason Sorens: This was a really interesting class and I feel like I've really gained a lot from it. However, you need to put in effort if you want to do well as there are assigned readings before every class and they can be difficult to understand. There are also weekly tests but they're pretty short and easy. The professor is great and he makes you understand everything he's teaching and has helpful office hours. He's a great grader as well. All in all, it's a really fun class and Professor Sorens makes it even better.\"",
            "review 2: \"18F with Jason Sorens: This class is an incredibly interesting one both if you are looking for a starting point in a Gov major or if you are a different major looking to learn a bit more about American Politics. Professor Sorens is pretty great. He is one of those special professors at Dartmouth that teach a political subject but also manage to remain completely unbiased, instead giving leading questions and comments that lead to further discussion in the class. The structure of the class isn't too difficult. There are readings before each class, and one quiz each week over the readings, which comprises 48% of your total grade. The quizzes aren't incredibly hard to get a B on, but it takes a bit more effort if you want an A average on them. 12% of the grade comes from participation, and the remaining 40% is from three short essays you write that comprise your final, so there is no final exam. The readings are fairly intensive (though not that difficult), so be prepared to spend at least an hour or two on the readings. Professor Sorens does a good job of keeping the lectures interesting. I would highly suggest taking Gov 3 with Professor Sorens.\"",
            "review 3: \"18F with Jason Sorens: Not really what I expected going in, but still an enjoyable class. Learned a lot from the lectures and Prof. Sorens kept them super interesting and easy to follow. It took me a while to get into a groove with the readings, as they were often pretty dense and usually required some re-reading, but my weekly quiz scores gradually got better. Gov 3 was definitely a good class which I enjoyed taking. However, this is by no means a layup. You have to do the readings and listen in the lectures because any of it can come up in the quiz. Even with the generous curve, not doing the readings/not listening is gonna land you a C.\""

He was always actively trying in influence his students' political views and was very intolerant of conservative thinking, which was annoying most every day. If you can deal with the most extreme liberal perspective on politics currently alive in teaching, take this course, its little work and a way to get a good grade.\"",
            "review 2: \"05X with Jeffrey R.: Have you read the Constitution? Do you, on occasion, peruse the New York Times? If so, you won't exactly LEARN anything in this class, but you can display that knowledge and perhaps boost your ego to some extent, which is a nice thing, especially in the summer months. I would assume you get a SOC for this class? If for some reason you dread this distrib, this class would allay your fears. Anyway, if you need to take a gov class, or ever need an easy third or fourth class, this is a pleasant if occasionally tedious option.\""
