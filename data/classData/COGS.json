In terms of personal enjoyment tho, really know what your interests are before you sign up.

If you aren't pretty interested in either philosophy, cogsci, or neuro, then these readings will be pretty tedious for you and the class might not be worth your while. But for those who are interested in one or all of these things, it's a good opportunity to see what's currently going on in philosophy-oriented cogsci work. Solid 7/10 for me.

Also will say Jonathan's lectures were better than Adina's, although the material in both were simply not great. This field is just emerging - at least, that's what they said - so many concepts were up for debate. Yet it seemed that when Adina graded my papers, everything I said was wrong. Quizzes/exams were so hard (average was incredibly low, like in the 60s) and revolved around trash multiple choice questions with vague answers, where it seemed like multiple answers could be correct. Yet (in this just emerging field where there isn't always a \"correct\" theory), there was no option for appealing/explaining your answer. Multiple choice was trash, just want to say again. The exams were also designed to be incredibly HARD, and quizzed us on the most minute of details. Like others have said, the readings are useless, and are really long - you have to work really hard to skim and try to distill ideas if you don't want to sink all your time into these readings. This class has steered me away from a major in cognitive science. There's too much breadth, and not nearly enough depth in lecture, and so its hard to go in depth on the essays when you really don't know what's going on. It's really cool that this field is interdisciplinary, its really not cool that we spend one or two lectures on each discipline and move on. AI was one lecture, perception was another, etc. If you found something interesting, well too bad, we're already moving on. Trash, cannot emphasize enough.\"",

The lectures were often very dry (I will say Jonathan's lectures were much better than Adina's) and we jumped from topic to topic really quickly without getting into much of the science part of cognitive science. I hated how it was so theoretical (it could be this or this... no one knows). Adina graded all three of my papers and I the comments were so unhelpful, basically said \"good job, but that's all wrong.\" The midterm and final were impossibly difficult and time consuming (some students spent upwards of 12 hours). I barely got the median grade but there's no way I could have done better because Adina and Jonathan never put in the time to tell us what they were looking for. The readings are useless for the class but some are interesting if you have some extra time. This class wrecked my confidence and just left me more confused than I started.\"",

I had never taken a social science class before this and I'm not planning on majoring in it, so this was a nice broad intro to a lot of different topics and fields of study. There were a lot of readings at times, but most of them were pretty interesting, and they were mostly used as examples of the concepts being covered (I ended up skimming many of them and being ok). The lectures were very fast at times, but very interesting, and it was cool to hear both professors' perspectives on topics being debated in the field. There's one lecture on each topic, which is good as an overview and points you towards other classes to take if you want to go more in-depth. Sometimes it felt more like philosophy than science, like for the papers - make sure you know how to write a good argumentative essay. Grades were based on the 3 papers (relating to a topic that interested you, and you would present topics in small groups beforehand for feedback), a midterm and final (these were open note since we were online, but they made the questions more confusing to make up for it... the curve saved us all), and attendance/participation. The TA, Catherine Holland, was so nice and gave helpful feedback on paper topics. Overall, I learned a lot and really enjoyed this class, would definitely recommend!\"",

Its really stressful to study for exams given how much content there is, but the exams tend to not be TOO specific. Roskies is kind of a hardo on response papers. Advice: really focus on a philosophical, well-structured layout and be concise. She is a philosopher and carries that heavily into this course. This course is definitely not a layup, but its not hard to get in the B range. I did find Roskies to be a super nice prof and she brought her really cute giant dog to class everyday. Professor Phillips co-taught this class, and his lectures were definitely easier to follow. I think he would probably be an easier grader, though he never graded one of my papers .\"",

She constantly assigns 30-60 page readings per class, and in her own words, \"You shouldn't memorize it, but you should know exactly what it is saying\". I attended her office hours to ask her how she structured her tests and which areas she would focus most on, and she replied, \u201cA little bit of true and false, multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short answer. You need to be prepared for everything\u201d. Possibly the most unhelpful reply I\u2019ve received throughout my time at Dartmouth. Professor Roskies makes no attempt to help her students succeed. She does not provide a textbook, clear notes, practice tests, or study guides. She grades essays harshly, but she does not provide clear commentary on how to fix it. Asking her to explain her comments simply causes more confusion and does not allow room for improvement. Her tests can range from anything from any reading of her choice, her vague powerpoint slides, or anything she happens to mention in class. She is available for office hours, but those are nothing short of useless, as she is incapable of explaining any of her lectures coherently. In addition, Professor Roskies constantly interrupts and argues with her guest/co-professor, further confusing her students and preventing them from understanding the point of the lecture. I was interested in majoring in Cognitive Science prior to taking this course, and I left the term having lost all interest. Unless you truly enjoy the field of Cognitive Science and plan on becoming a major, do not take this course. Professor Roskies is an example of an extremely well-qualified researcher who has no business teaching students. Cog Sci I is a waste of the 36 courses you will take at Dartmouth.\""

Some of his videos are funny but completely pointless, and some of this time would be better spent going over concepts before the test. The His lectures are terribly imbalanced, oversimplifying certain concepts while overemphasizing others. When the exams come around, certain \"easy\" concepts that seemed almost stupidly obvious become difficult due to the confusing way he asks questions. On the final, I truly walked out of the room not having ANY idea of how well I did, even though I studied pretty thoroughly. The TA was terrible, she Wikipedia'd the questions I had when I went into office hours, meaning that she didn't really know the material. Professor Kelley also was not present on two separate occasions when I tried to go to office hours. For some, this class is very easy, but for others, even some that succeed in other Psych classes, it is a struggle. This is very indicative of the randomness and almost pointlessness of the class.

            "review 28: \"06S with William Kelley: This is a strange class. Whether you like it or not depends on if you enjoy multiple choice tests and don't mind crazy lectures that are often disorganized and feature random stuff that has nothing to do with the topic at hand (yet are highly entertaining). With that in mind, here's some more detailed info. The Good: 1) The lectures are never dull. Kelley always has video clips, random games, or demos ready for your enjoyment. People don't typically fall asleep in this class because the lectures are enjoyable (and because class is at 2). 2) Lots of canceled class. This is great if it's your senior spring (like it was for me). Kelley must have canceled at least 5 classes (although one wasn't his fault because his hypnotist never showed). 3) Easy tests. If you're good at multiple choice this class is not difficult. You just have to take decent notes, actually read the text book, and use the study guide that comes with the book. If you're willing to put the time in to study and are generally good at figuring out what goes on multiple choice tests, then you'll do really well. If you did badly in Psych 1 you'll likely do badly in this also. 4) Interesting material. I know a lot of the reviews say the material is boring, but I didn't think so. I mean it's psychology so most of it is common sense, but there's still some good info to be had. 5) Light work load. The work just consists of reading from a textbook, about a chapter every other class or so. The reading is easy and short (about 20-25 pages per chapter). The Bad: 1) Disorganized lectures. It seemed like sometimes Kelley would just forget to organize his slides the night before or something, because there were quite a few lectures where he'd skip over stuff or not know what was coming next and have to just try to fake it. 2) Crazy demos/movies. Kelley will often show these completely random movies (e.g., \"Psychology Hunter\", \"Leeroy Jenkins\") that take up about 5 minutes of class but have nothing to do with anything. He'll even admit to it afterwards (or else come up with some lame justification, like he did with the Leeroy Jenkins movie). And even the ones that do have a point just go on too long (e.g., \"Star Wars Kid\"). Ok yeah they're funny, and they make the lectures fun, but there's too many of them, they're too random, and they go on too long. It's like he doesn't respect the material to want to teach it to us, so he throws in these movies he makes to show off how funny he is. There's a fine line between using multimedia to really enhance a class (e.g., Jay Hull) and just going overboard with it (e.g., Bill Kelley). Then again, I'll likely never forget functional fixedness because of that Star Wars Kid movie, so maybe there's a method to the insanity. 3) Lots of canceled class. Yes I know I listed this as a positive. Canceled class can be good. But when you're paying $40k a year, you expect to get your money's worth. And frankly, I don't feel like I did with this class. Yeah, it's great to have a day off every now and then. But when you have a class canceled pretty much every week, then something's wrong. There was so much cancellation that Kelley wasn't able to lecture on one of the chapters in the book, even though it still appeared on the final. And there were times when he just rushed through stuff so he could get through everything he needed. That's really not an effective way to teach. So there you have it. Would I recommend taking this class? I'd have to say yes. It's entertaining if nothing else. But don't be surprised if you get frustrated at times when it just seems like Kelley refuses to stay on topic. Sometimes I get the feeling he knows we're not going to remember any of this stuff anyway so he just doesn't care. But I'm probably wrong.\"",

Then Prof. Kelley notes that he will \"seriously consider\" your petition, but, \"most likely do nothing.\" In addition, he does not round up, ie when the cut off for B- is 80, and you receive a 79.99, he records your grade as a C+ unless you go through this process which will, as he states, \"most likely\" not benefit you in any way. This process of making students post for \"grade grubbing\" demeans students who are otherwise fighting for the generally less than one percentages point that they already deserve in standard grading policies.

This course used to be known at Dartmouth as a major layup, but this course is absolutely no longer a layup. Old reviews that talk about the layups of midterms have been replaced. They are still multiple choice, but they are so contrived and ambiguous that for 50% of the questions it feels like there are two to three possible answers. For what it is worth, the one positive of this class is that there is ZERO attendance requirement, and because the lectures are recorded and the sessions are all lecture, this is a class that you could never go to once if you wanted to. I went most of the time, but by the second week we only consistently had about 30% of the class there on any given day. The course grading scale is: 10% for online experiments (these are very easy and you definitely should get a 100% on these), 25% for the first midterm, 25% for the second midterm, and 40% for the final. Because tests account for 90% of your grade, and because the tests are no longer layups, I really wouldn't take this class again. I took it because it seemed interesting and I needed an easy senior spring third class, but man was that a mistake. If you really really love psych, take the course. The topics are actually very interesting, but the book is one step short of sleeping medication and the lectures are very dry. Probably wouldn't take again had I known.\""
