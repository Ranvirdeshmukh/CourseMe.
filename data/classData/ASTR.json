We also have a final paper which is 6-10 pages on any topic of your choosing as long as you can relate it to the concepts of the class. The textbook isn't good. Elizabeth is a fucking gem though and I will defend her honor to the death; I went into her office hours sobbing about worrying I would fail the class and she gave me a hug and told me it was going to be alright. She's wonderful, and when she went on maternity leave we were able to convince her and Ryan to cut out the final exam just because no one wanted to do it.

There aren't any tests or exams, but instead we have a final 6-10 single spaced review paper on radiative processes in astrophysics. Basically talk about some astrophysics topic and how the course material relates to it. Class composition is mostly grad students with one or two undergrads. Prof Newton is super nice and helpful with everything and the class itself is super interesting. It's also really hard in case you haven't gotten the memo.

Psets were infrequent and pretty simple. Exams were extremely fair. The final project is easy to do well on if you put in a consistent effort all along, go to office hours, make a good plan, etc. No computational background is expected but you do some rudimentary Python notebook modification.

This course has by no means discouraged me from taking other ASTR classes in the future, but I will try my best to avoid taking them online.

The entire course builds toward each student making an original calculation to the field of astronomy and writing a paper about it, and while that sounds difficult, professor Newton was constantly available for questions and consultation and was by far the best part of this class. That being said, the switch to remote learning was awkward and the rest of the course could have flowed more smoothly than it did.

There is a *lot* of room for improvement in the course setup, but in my opinion the content and the relative lack of work makes up for it. Class was entirely lecture-based (though the first three weeks were asynchronous virtual for seemingly no reason...) so if you want a discussion class this is not it, but if you just want to show up and take notes, that's definitely what it is. The course is definitely a history-based astro class, so if you want that (with no math at all. like literally none.) this is a good way to get a sci distrib. The readings and extra videos are actually optional, everything we were tested on was in the lectures. There are two projects, a midterm, and a final- one of the projects is an observing project which I thought was a lot of fun, but could definitely wreck your sleep schedule if you don't routinely stay up super late. The other project you can choose-- i made the astrolabe (which wasn't too terrible but was a lot more work than I thought it would be), but you could also just write an 8 page paper on pretty much anything, or watch a movie from a list and write a paper on that if you wanted to play it pretty safe. The midterm and the final were mostly short answer/paragraphs, and mostly followed the main points of the lectures. Now, for my complaints-- I definitely agree that the TAs were really hit-or-miss on grading, and the one time I emailed them about my project, they never got back to me, even just to say that I had emailed too close to the deadline and they couldn't give a decent response. Additionally, the lectures started out perfectly fine and easy, but once we got to modern theories they got much more confusing and difficult to understand, because we weren't really given the foundation to actually understand stuff like string theory or inflatons. The prof could also do much better with regards to powerpoint slides, they don't really have most of the actually important info on them and are usually unnecessarily vague/confusing (and the prof tends to go off on tangents sometimes). This was much, much more noticeable in the later weeks of the course. Overall I'd say that it's a solid sci distrib to take if you don't want to do any math or problem sets, but there are definitely some frustrating moments that I could do without.\"",

Prof is actually a super nice guy, but the material is all over the place and he just uses his same slides from the physics classes he teaches.

He is a worldly reknown physicist with much experience sharing scientific ideas with the public, so his lectures were always the most engaging.\"",

I don't actually know who our \"professor\" is, or even if that matters at all. We were initially told that it would be taught by two professors who were present on the first day, only to switch professors (sometimes within the same week) throughout the course. The TAs remained the same, and I think they were the only highlight of the course, but the adults made it incredibly hard to attain a general trajectory. For example, a new professor came in, spent an hour lecturing slides that we had done last week, and then we had a quiz on the slides he was supposed to teach (but did not) a few days later. Additionally, it's pretty hard to develop a relationship with a professor and understand who to email for questions when they just go AWOL. I think everyone had to rely on the TAs (who are sick/deserve a raise). Finally, just a general gripe, the workload is constant and the questions and material is taught on a very surface level, leaving you to figure it out on your own. On the first day, they lecture you about the merit of a B immediately after conducting a survey that showed 97% of the class is not an astronomy major and 85% is taking it for a graduation requirement. Pretty irritating. Don't take this class unless you want to think about Astronomy quite a bit.

The carousel of professors that rotated through the class were horrible lecturers and turned off any interest we might have had in astronomy.

The group exercises were switched to completion grades because so many kids were spending hours on these assignments so that was pretty good. If you have last year's quizzes you'll be golden and cop an A or A- with close to no effort. HOWEVER, the sequence of pointless essays you have to write is totally ass. 5 total: final essay overview (1.75% overall grade), a pointless practice essay, first draft (3.5 % overall grade), second draft (5% of final draft), and a final paper (29.75% of your grade). These essays are complete shitter tier I-do-not-care papers. They will put a damper on your summer vibes. Each word typed is like taking a needle to my fingertips.

He is excited to talk to any student and readily accessible, and chill and flexible with deadlines. Good at explaining things. Office hours at his house and over zoom were interesting and extremely helpful. Observing nights were a good time and helped rediscover the awe of the night sky and the fact that there is so much out there. The final project feels a bit isolated and disjointed from a lot of the coursework. It's a lot of work, but it's spaced out throughout the term, so it doesn't have to all happen at once. It's all about a specific telescope and then a specific observation, and it feels limiting and needlessly complex at times because the scientific papers and data you have to look at is beyond the scope of a beginner course. There are a lot of small assignments that can be overwhelming and feel somewhat pointless sometimes when you have to write yet again question for a guest astronomer about research that you can barely understand from the press release, let alone the scientific paper.

Ryan Hickox is a terrible teacher btw - I don't care/know how good he is at his profession but he always glosses over the important stuff during lecture and always announces quizzes/utilization of office hours/observing sessions/basically every non-official-class thing at the LAST minute, which is super disrespectful in my opinion. Aside from this, I second all of the comments about the unnecessary and super difficult work - take the \"question for guest astronomer\" thing for example. It's graded based on the \"interestingness\" of the question:) - which in order to have you should/need to - and this is what he says himself - read crazy difficult journal articles on that guest's work and demonstrate \"deep understanding of the concepts\" that you literally just learned today and might very well have no clue about.

He can be a bit dull sometimes, and you'd do fine without going to every single lecture. Weekly quizzes were doable with your notes and the textbook, but sometimes were pretty hard. The math in this class wasn't too bad, mainly just plugging into equations and finding variable relationships (physics 1 level math, no need for calc knowledge). The midterm was pretty easy tbh, he lets you write out anything you want on a piece of paper and bring it to the exam. You basically just need to read the textbook summaries and take notes in class to get an A. The research paper is the only part that I was a little iffy on. There is almost no elaboration on his expectations or even how to do a research paper (this was my first time doing a scientific paper like this).

But all the assessments were pretty rigorous. I spent about 8 hours each week studying -- although I usually study more than most students claim to. I think the course focused far too much on memorization. During orientation, Professors claimed that Dartmouth teaches classes focused on building skills, not learning information. So far that has generally been the case; but it was not the case with this course. The Professor would lecture about all the names of various parts of the universe and then we would be assessed rigorously in the form of 11 quizzes and 4 exams. It was as if the department thought this intro science class was too easy and cracked down on the Professor to make it hard, but since the class covered little to no conceptual thinking the only thing the Professor could do to make it hard was to test us rigorously on random facts that we will likely forget 90% of in a few months. That said, the exams were at least predictable. If you watch each lecture carefully and memorize all vocab terms, you will do well. I just wished the college would recognize that is ok to occasionally have a class with a high median. Sometimes students need to balance hard major courses.

Then for final class they all sat in and it was like Lego Star Wars when you see everyone in the cantina. Terribly logistically done - none of the individual people teaching knew where our level of understanding was because of all the shuffling around, so it resulted in a lot of redundancy and confusion. That said, it's an interesting class and a FANTASTIC choice if you want a Science distrib without taking a real science course. If you were good at science in high school you'll crank here. I'm by no means a science student but am of the opinion that Astronomy is perhaps the most important science to know a little about to be a well rounded person (esp. because it kind of puts physics + chem + biology all together). Best science no doubt. My two SCI distribs were this and Astr 4, taking which was a breeze after taking this. Would recommend that path to people who don't want to go do a real lab etc. In this same way that CS30 is more about how you think & write about math rather than the actual discrete math, this course is more about how you approach scientific writing and thinking about the universe rather than doing the hard calculations.\""

            "review 1: \"24S with Graham Edwards: Interesting class if you like astro but definitely an easier lab class. There are 4 labs but the last one was canceled. His lectures can be boring, halfway through the class period would never be full. There is also 5 cumulative quizzes except the first, a writing assignment, a group project, and then a final project. Would consider this to be a busy layup.\""
