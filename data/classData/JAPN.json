She grades much less harshly on the kanji quizzes (which do not happen during class anymore) and ends class on time and doesn't pack too much into the tests without giving us as much extra time as we need (if we have another class, but aren't yet done, she'll tell us to take the test with us, finish it later, and drop it off at her office); on the other hand, the prof has this habit of sending out important announcements over email, and class is much less serious and ... class-ish. There's still drill. Fortunately, it's only three days a week (though which days changed every week, which was really annoying). Just remember to keep demanding an afternoon drill section. We only did two non-textbook readings, but we spent like maybe three weeks total on them. There were random guests, and a skit at the end (which didn't require that you jam as many new vocab and grammar structures in there as you could, thank goodness), of course. The skit was fun, and my group's was awesome, but I felt like we'd put too much time and effort into it when we found out that 30% of the skit grade was going to be class participation after other people's skits. I mean, I don't regret spending hours and hours and hours working on the skit; it's just that finding that out at the last minute was kind of a letdown.\"",

You learn a great deal of vocab and kanji (125) plus new sentence structures. If you struggled through Japanese 1, think about putting in twice the time and effort because that's what you'll have to do in Japanese 2. There was also a wiki project where you research a prefecture and make a presentation on it to the class. Overall, this course goes by too quickly so if you're going to take it, make sure it's the only difficult class you're going to take, unless your THAT good with Japanese.\"",
            "review 2: \"08W with Mayumi Ishida: Listen all you Japanese Anime fanatics, Language buffs, and Badminton players: Japanese is tough. Monstrously tough. It will break you, and suck up all the free time you thought you had coming into this class. For me, Japanese was much more work than all of my other classes for the term COMBINED - which in turn, provided for the most stressful term of my Dartmouth career (and I've had...4 terms so far). I don't think any of the other languages at Dartmouth are taught entirely in their native tongue - they usually start off with English instruction. Japanese is the exception here. There's just so much work required in Japanese for so little payoff (and yes, you Economics majors, I'm counting opportunity costs as well). The Major/Minor in Japanese aren't exactly the most marketable degrees in the world and furthermore, the intensive Japanese sequence requires that you sacrifice many classes in order for you to just achieve the Minor (3 Introductory classes, 3 LSA+ classes, and then STILL a few more classes). Plus...my friends in Chinese and French enjoyed better grades and had fewer time commitments than I had. The class is composed mostly of Anime fanatics from East Wheelock (for at least 2 straight years, the Dartmouth Japanese Program has had a large EW contingent). After about 2 terms, I decided to give up the Japanese Program - and that turned out to be the best decision I have ever made here at Dartmouth (for in the Spring term, I took a 3rd class in place of Japanese 3 which turned out to be extremely pivotal in my Dartmouth career). I know people who are so far behind now in their majors because they committed to the LSA+ (one of them even dropping out of all of his major classes entirely). It's just not worth it. If you're thinking about this class, make sure you're passionate about Japanese language and culture. If you're just another Anime fanatic...well...just get Rosetta Stone instead.\"",
            "review 3: \"07W with Mayumi Ishida: This class is effectively self-taught (though you still have to come to class because the prof takes attendance). About the only thing we do in class is to practice speaking, not actually learn new stuff. If you can't handle teaching yourself everything from the textbook, this course is not for you. What I did not find out, however, until towards the end of the class is that this class is SUPPOSED to be like that, but they didn't bother to include that little caveat on the syllabus. At least we had afternoon drill, so basically if you had morning drill and you overslept/had homework to finish/needed to skip it for some other reason, you could (and were probably expected to) go to the afternoon session. If the prof ever says that they chose not to have afternoon drill because of lack of interest, that is a total and complete lie. Poll your classmates and DEMAND it. That's what one of my classmates did at the end of last term, and it worked. The end-of-term project this time is a presentation instead of a skit. It's a page long and you have to memorize what you've written and present it to the class with pictures or other visual aids. Just be prepared to have to present during reading period, which is what we had to do. We also had to come in and take a kanji quiz (this class doesn't have any other kind of quizzes) during reading period. I don't think either of those things is allowed, but you shouldn't find that surprising because the prof seems to think that Japanese is special and not subject to the rules that every other class is subject to.\"",

For those of you who have taken Japanese 1, that class seems almost leisurely compared to Japanese 2, and that's saying something. Ishida is a hard teacher and a hard grader. She expects you to know all of the material in the reading before coming to class, including memorization of dialogues in Japanese, new vocabulary, and new grammatical forms. She'll talk to everyone in class several times, and if there's one thing you didn't study or can't remember, she'll find it. For much of the term, my hard work was inspired pretty much by fear. It also doesn't help that about a third of the class comes in with prior knowledge of Japanese, giving others something of a disadvantage. That said, you'll learn more in this class than in other language classes. The teaching is very effective.\"",

Ishida Sensei is very nice, but her tests are harsh (I always ran out of time before the end). There are a lot of homework assignments graded on completion which cushions your grade for the tests (of which it was not uncommon for the lower score to be in the 50s). As someone who is naturally bad at learning languages, I always felt like I was a step behind the rest of the class, although about a third of my class dropped because they were struggling so much, leaving mostly just the people who already knew some Japanese coming in. Despite the stress this class put me through, I did learn a lot and will be continuing to Japanese 2.\"",
            "review 2: \"22F with Mayumi Ishida: A very fun, engaging, and worthwhile experience. However, DO NOT take this if you are planning to take other hard classes in the same term. Japanese 1 does not conform to the \"language classes are easy\" generalization. Firstly, 8 meetings a week (5 classes, 3 drills) is quite a commitment. Secondly - although I will say that the work itself was not particularly hard IF you pay attention in class and at least skip the textbook - assignments are plentiful and can really add up even if you manage your time correctly. Lastly, the Japanese language requires a lot of memorization (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, long form/short form conjugation, and kaiwa - conversations to be memorized for each class) so it is challenging and time-consuming in that way. Despite all this, Ishida-sensei was a fantastic teacher and super nice, and I am impressed at how much I learned in only 9 weeks. If you want a quantification of work, it was 1 sheet of character memorization per weekday (Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji), listening practice and homework sheet weekly-ish, and quizzes weekly or sometimes twice a week. Four exams and a final exam, all timed. Ishida-sensei was a fair grader so pay attention and do the work and you'll reap the benefits.\"",
            "review 3: \"22F with Mayumi Ishida: NOT a layup at all with Ishida. The class is heavily split up into sections for exams, quizzes, homework, in class participation, drill, attendance, etc. This is definitely not an easy language course simply because Ishida grades pretty hard. We learn so much through the Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji and actual course material so there's a lot to keep memorizing throughout the term. That being said, exams were very fair and if you could keep up in class and read Ishida's Japanese textbook, you could get 95+. It would be kinda annoying asking questions in class because sometimes Ishida just deliberately would pretend to not understand you--so just use Jinglish and try your best. Drill was extremely annoying with how Ishida mandated the drill instructors to dock attendance grades just downright ruthlessly. Other than that, if you want to learn as much Japanese as possible within 1 term, I'd recommend this class with Ishida.\"",

Ishida-sensei is super fun and engaging, and overall teaches this complex language very effectively. Also, I was able to create some really close bonds with my classmates because of the amount of time we spent together though class 5 days a week, drill 3 days a week, and doing homework. My classmates were all super funny, friendly, and different from each other, which will probably be true every year, and took the class for lots of different reasons (yes, beyond anime). The struggle came in with self-directed study outside of class. The workload is intense and there are currently no tutors, so if you're coming in knowing no Japanese (like I did) you'll need to work hard and may want to ask your more experienced classmates for help. In my experience this last year (2021), there were at least two take-home quizzes every week and remote, timed tests once every two or three weeks.\"",

It was my first term at Dartmouth with the whole 10-weeks thing to get used to, but still, the amount of material covered is super impressive for language learning. But the class is GREAT -- usually very small, and the prof is always directly engaging you and your classmates (often via conversation with you) every minute of the class. It's fun and very low-key in class (lots of silly sentences result). Almost all of the material is initially self-taught via homework that usually just tells you to look at the textbook (it'll be pretty obvious in your small class the next day if you didn't do it)--and the textbook is free and online. The major drawback to the class is that the only drill section is 7:45am. Yikes. But in my class at least we went to breakfast together afterward in the time between drill and class, which was fun. Oh, did I mention that after the first day you don't speak English in the classroom anymore? (Don't worry--somehow it all works out.) Professor: Ishida-sensei can seem a little intimidating at first, but she really wants you to succeed! And she's excellent in the classroom. The one thing is, if you want to ask her questions in ENGLISH, you have to go to office hours (or you can ask your drill instructor). She is very generous grading most work (quizzes can sometimes be harsh if it's fill-in-the-blank and there can't be partial credit, but if there is a partial credit opportunity, she has been known to take off one-tenth of a point for a mistake, just to give you an idea). Workload: Because class is 5 days per week, there's a LOT of time invested in nightly homework (most of which isn't turned in, but it is immediately and painfully obvious if you didn't do it, and it'll be a nightmare catching up for the next quiz or test since they happen on a pretty regular basis). That said, if you keep up every night or almost every night, there's not going to be a single day when you're crushed by the workload from this course--it's pretty well spaced out and constant (with new material every two days), so even though I spent the most time outside of class on Japanese versus my other two courses, it wasn't the direct cause of any near-sleepless nights.\""
