In essence, this class is structured around having students doing unpaid labor for archives and responsibilities that should be placed on paid staff at the library. Because the digital exhibit will be kept at Rauner, the professors, ESPECIALLY Professor Rabig, want perfection. Prof Rabig will contact you even after the exhibits and grades are due so that you can continue to revise the exhibit even after the term is over. To make matters worse, they do not make expectations clear. They will email the class and post Canvas announcements sometimes the day items are due or even AFTER. Unfortunately, I did not find this course to be well organized and would not consider it a layup at all. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the content and had a great experience interviewing my narrator.

Lectures are clear, organized, and relatively straightforward. Trumbull is an effective lecturer: not exactly inspiring but very knowledgeable. There are plenty of opportunities to ask questions, and he's usually pretty good at answering them. This class involved a lot of work. In fact, the workload was unnecessarily large. The readings were very long, generally tedious, and hardly inspiring. The lectures helped to understand the material, but the discussions were usually pointless, superficial treatments. Trumbull is not an easy grader. Nor is he particularly good at communicating his expectations. In fact, he never seemed to take a very keen interest in his students. If you want to talk to him outside of class, make sure you go to his office hours. Trumbull is terrible at communicating through e-mail, often taking several days to answer questions if he doesn't ignore them altogether. At the end of the term, I can't say that I really learned a great deal. Ultimately, it was an unnecessary use of time and effort that I should have opted out of before it was too late.

Great mix of classic African literature and more contemporary books, as well. Our major assignments were three papers, each 5-7 pages, and they were graded very reasonably.

Talk little in class, listen a lot. I loved most of the books but we were expected to finish one almost every week (between 100 and 600 pgs), so be prepared for a massive amount of reading.

I felt like Ayo was always yelling at us and she seemed to treat us like middle schoolers with her harsh rules and seriousness. I don't think I ever saw her smile in class. Classes were mostly class discussion which was ok though depends on the students in your class, but I wish Ayo had spent a bit more time lecturing on the background of the books since I often felt like knowing more about the history/culture would have helped me understand the book better. The papers were SUCH a drag. There were 3 6-7 page papers on an assigned topic and then a final 15 page paper. I though she was an unnecessarily tough grader and not really a fair one. Luckily the oral presentation and class participation part of the grade will help your grade. Overall, not the worst but not the best either.

There were three assigned topic five-page papers, an oral mini-group (2-3 people) presentation, and one open topic 12-15 page final paper. She did tell most of the class they didn't know how to write after the first paper and that they should go to RWIT for help. Although a little harsh to some, she also gave TONS of hints in class as to what she wanted in the papers. If you aren't a strong writer, don't take this class. Finally, she was pretty strict on attendance, being on time, and having done the readings. However, I think it was pretty fair within our small class atmosphere. It was a matter of respect to her and to other students who did do all the work. In addition, if you are actually sick (I was twice during the term) she's super nice about it and even gave me a pretty long extension on one of the short papers.

We had cyclical discussions about the environmental devastation of African and Asian countries. I didn\u2019t feel like I could speak to specific, intimate examples of environmental colonialism due to the dense amount of readings. This is NOT a layup, but provides a survey of environmental world history. I took this as AAAS50, expecting a more focused framework to study the degradation of our environment on African and Afro-descendent people. Too reliant on white historians & pre-colonial/colonial scholarship, but fair breadth on Asian (South-Asian) scholars. On the last day of class Haynes played the trailer for Born Free- about a white woman who grew up in Kenya raising lion cubs. Not ONE, like always, African was present in this ancient movie. It was just generic African wildlife and your typical white safari savior. Black people were reduced to employees of the white game ranger, or as a woman attacked by a lion. In the AAAS course (recommend) Idea of Africa we deconstructed the same trailer and critiqued how european entertainment presents Africa. In Hayne\u2019s course, last day of final presentations, a white student presented context on Africa. His very first slide he wrote \u201cMost underdeveloped continent (except Antarctica).\u201d Now HOW do you attend 10 weeks of classes on COLONIALISM & DEVELOPMENT and bring zeerrooo critical analysis as to why that may be? Some students consider this class a layup because papers are spread out, and although you write a total of 4- you aren\u2019t required to note-take or remember anything from lectures/readings.\"",

Overall the class is a lot much more work then expected\"",
            "review 3: \"22W with Douglas Haynes: Overall, I thought this was a decent class, but that statement comes with quite a few qualifications. First, the lectures are not particularly engaging. I'm not a big history guy so that could have played a part, but most lectures were quite dense and Professor Haynes is not animated like some other professors at Dartmouth are. He knows the subject material incredibly well, but unless you already have an interest in the area the lectures probably won't draw your attention. Second, this class was quite difficult: I averaged about 6.8 hours of homework a week to receive an A, which is a good deal more than other classes I've taken. The two biggest culprits behind this are the volume of reading he assigns and the final paper students have to complete. He assigns more readings than any student -- recognizing the other responsibilities we have -- could reasonably complete in a week. There was one week where he assigned 320+ pages of readings, not all of which was even relevant to the topics we were discussing. The only way to get by with that kind of workload is to skim -- which I think everyone in the class who bothered to look at the readings did -- and this left me feeling like I had a shaky and superficial understanding of the material. If you decide to take this class and the volume of reading has not changed, be ready to skim AND plan out your time/assignments very well. The final paper, a 12 pager on a topic of our choice related to environmental history in Africa or Asia, was also a bit of a doozy. He expects a ton of research behind these papers, and that can be hard to deliver. Start it early in the term if you can! All of this being said, I still found the class to be decent because I did find myself learning quite a bit and the discussions he holds for each module were quite interesting. He's very good at leading a discussion without letting his own opinion dominate the conversation. If you do take this class, just be aware of the volume of reading and the difficulty of some of the assignments. And I would not recommend taking it unless you already have a decent interest in the subject area.\"",

Definitely less work than 76 (his class on modern india), but similar course style (readings, regular papers, a final, if I remember correctly). Probably the best thing about his classes is how much he's willing to help with writing and how available he is in office hours.

The study guides he prepares allowed me to discuss and debate the exam questions with other students, leading me to a much deeper and longer lasting understanding of the material than in other history courses in which profs simply tell you what to read for the exams.\"",

According to Freidberg, the West is pretty much the root of all the problems in the world. The current conflict in Kenya is apparently the fault of white colonials who have been dead for a hundred years, not the people who are holding the guns. Let me be frank. This class takes objectivity, feeds it to a pack of dogs, shoots it with an AK-47, lights it on fire and scatters the ashes to the ends of the earth. Freidberg does not present a balanced version of the facts. Every new concept she introduces, she immediately takes on an opinionated slant that never lets up. We never get to see both sides of the issue. I knew very little about African politics or history before this class, and I am frustrated that the professor refused to present me with a balanced narrative so I could decide what to believe. She constantly impressed her own viewpoint on us with almost no recognition of other ideas. That said, the class is interesting. We got into the nitty-gritty of international politics and development economics, both their history and current events. The class integrates economics, history, and government, so if you have an interest in any of these areas, it should come in handy. Overall, the material is varied and interesting, but like i said, FAR from objective.\"",

The class consisted of a midterm, a research paper, a takehome final and three book commentaries each worth 5% of your overall grade. Personally I found the development aspect much more interesting than the ecology but Freidberg demonstrated that the two topics are intertwined. The class was a bit frustrating because it covered such a wide number of topics for example we spent only one day on famine, one day on HIV/AIDS, one day on tourism etc. Though not always successful, Freidberg did attempt to facilitate discussions and in doing so present a variety of opinions. Overall, the class gives a basic understanding of the variety of development issues plaguing the country of Africa and shows how solutions are far from simple of easy.\"",

Some of the book 'reports' we had to do felt like busy work--but overall, the assignments and readings she had us do were very helpful. She definitely has her spin on the material--but she is heavily supported by numerous other scholars on this spin (so i don't agree with the other review). She's available outside class--but you have to make a real effort her as she is only here tuesday-thursday most weeks. Good class.\"",

            "review 6: \"08W with Susanne Freidberg: First of all, \"Prozac\" is definitely correct in saying that this class will depress the hell out of you. But if you're even considering this course what did you expect? Africa has been f***ed over by the Europeans for centuries and there are still plenty of ramifications of this. Most of the readings were interesting, although there were some that were pretty boring. Generally there were two readings a night (20-30 pages ea.) and an occasional NYTimes article or two. I feel the class attempted to cover way to many topics to be truly effective: all of pre-colonialism in one day, two days for colonialism, and then one day on diverse subjects like HIV/AIDS, eco-tourism, structural adjustment, and others. Freidberg is a good lecturer, with her subject material very well-organized, and it is very apparent that she knows a lot about the subject, and has spent much time studying about and in the continent. While she does present somewhat biased views, I agree with one of the other reviews in saying that \"Prozac\" is a little dramatic, and that she is backed up by a lot of evidence to support her biases. I think people in a class like this may get tired of all the despair and tragedy (I mean I did too), but that doesn't mean we can skip over the hard facts of poverty and disease in Africa (with much of it caused by the continuing effects of colonialism and persisting outside involvement of other countries --- not to say this isn't needed). Perhaps it is just the title that may be a little misleading, Africa (obvi), ecology, yea there was some of that, development... sort of. Yes, the course talks about development, however this could lead you to believe that the course is on current reforms for development in the continent. However, when Freidberg says development, she means more the lack of development and the struggles to attain any level of development. Keep this in mind. Overall, I'd say a good course, which allows someone to discuss the continent with at least a broad knowledge of different issues and their historical contexts.\"",

Case in point: one day a couple of girls in the class made a comment that was a bit un-p.c., but not wholly offensive. I understood where they were coming from and it was easy to see how they could misinterpret what they had read. Coly however, was very offended. She displayed a lack of academic grace that most professors have with students. The next class felt like an inquisition and everything was a bit uneasy for the following week. Dartmouth should be a place where people feel comfortable enough to stretch themselves mentally, and yet I feel like these girls were burnt for doing so.

This is the kind of class that if you aren't a lazy person you should do well. Prof. Colbert is an expert on anything to do with blackness, so she's good at facilitating discussion and generating topics from the plays. The bad part of class discussions was she'd just throw out questions and expect people to raise their hands and answer, but sometimes it'd be better b/c we broke up into groups to discuss. There were 2 group presentations or \"sparking\" during the term, which can be nerve-wrecking if ur that kind of person, but otherwise simple if u put the time into them. The 2 dramaturgy papers can catch u off guard if u put off research until the last minute, but if u pick a play u like to write about then they're actually fun to write and that should reflect in your grade.

Then Professor Colbert did not discourage free thought and new thinking, however she seems not to really consider your thoughts into the analysis of the play. Overall, I think the class was interesting because of the plays and also the study sessions that the other students put together.

            "review 14: \"04F with Benjamin Forest: I took this class for two reasons -- I needed to satisfy some distribs, and it sounded interesting. I have long thought segregation is wrong (as does everyone else). This class showed how prevalent segregation remains to be -- I guess I had never thought of it in those terms before -- and how this segregation is not just a result of personal preferences. It also showed that whites like to be around blacks in much smaller proportions than blacks would like, creating a dynamic instability, so that when blacks move into a neighborhood whites start to move out, causing ultimately all-black neighborhoods and extension of the ghetto life that blacks seem consigned to live in. Before I took the class, I was steadfastly against affirmative action (how can you end discrimination by discriminating?), and thought the class would be a good forum to share my views. Now, I'm less sure. We talked about two ways of looking at the fight to end discrimination: ending causes of discrimination (e.g. laws, policies, etc.), and ending effects of discrimination, by manually helping minorities. The first kind of action is more appealing, because it does not discriminate against whites, nor against blacks (at least in theory). But it cannot catch the myriads of small acts of (possibly unconscious) discrimination that occur all the time. For that, affirmative action -- unfair as it might be -- is also useful. So it's a tough call whether affirmative action makes sense. We talked about these issues with regard particularly to the laws that have come up to support people's convictions one way or the other, and the geographies that have affected the creation and interpretation of the laws. In the course of this class, we read many court cases, a few books, and several articles, relating to both the issues and how they have been treated under the law. All of this was good and interesting. The only objection I would make is that Benjamin Forest grades in a kind of scary way; I still have not found a pattern to it. On an exam, I got 8/10 on a reading I hadn't done, and 14/20 on another because I had read it and put too much information. On a paper, he accused me of \"technically plagiarizing\"; I still have not figured out why. I did not cite any source, because I thought it to be common knowledge. This was a very serious accusation to make against me, and he of course took of many points for it. So, take this course if you want your brain to be challenged and expanded, and you want to see the law in action. But take it with a grain of salt: there is a TON of reading to do, and if you're obsessed with your GPA you might reconsider taking it.\"",

He was incredibly unorganized and unclear in his expectations for the class. He would tell us to have a certain novel read by a certain day in class, and then when that day came he would ask how many people had read it, only a handful would raise their hands and he would not lecture on/discuss it since he wanted to \"avoid spoilers\" for the novels. These novels have been out for 30-40 years and I'm sure people would actually read them if he enforced the timeline he creates but no, you read an entire novel in the course of five days and then get told you didn't have to (this happened every single time a novel was introduced, so eventually I learned, but still). We also didn't complete the syllabus laid out, we completely skipped Tar Baby and The Source of Our Self-Regard despite spending plenty of time repeating the same few buzzwords the prof liked to hear. I stg if I hear about how Morrison is \"interested in a historical maturity and moral adulthood\" one more time. The work outside of readings was minimal. There was a midterm made of 3, 2-3 page papers that was graded incredibly loosely, and a final \"research\" paper of 8-10 pages. I say \"research\" in quotes since we were only required to cite three sources. Is this class a Layup? Yes, the prof essentially said day one that if you participated in class, and wrote the midterm and final, you would get an A. Is it what I was hoping for? No. It was painfully easy, and a victim of what I dub the 80/20 rule (80% of things being said in discussion are made by 20% of the people in class).

We read about 4-5 full sized books (historical, informative genres). After about week 4, the class started to pick up very quickly and we went from reading a book in 2.5 weeks to reading it in 1 week. In addition, we had two 500-750 word essays due every week based on the book we had read the week prior. But, the books are all very interesting and detailed. Each essay asked us to use the context of the book to analyze a contemporary and primary source within that time period. Researching and writing on these topics became a little tiring, just based on how much there was to do, but you were actually learning really prominent and insightful things about race and slavery. The good thing though is that there is no late penalty in the class, so all of the essays could be turned in way past the due date if not able to be finished on time without any penalty. So, I cant discount it. Barthe is also SUPER specific about how he wants these essays done - essentially less is more.

If you attend lectures, Darryl provides you with enough material to write a paper. There are daily quizzes, but they are less about the book and more about concepts. He will give you a question and you have about 5 minutes to answer. For example, he asked us once to describe a social construct. Attendance is not mandatory; if you miss a quiz, Darryl just drops it in the end. I wouldn't recommend skipping though if you want to do well in the class.

All of the readings and papers for this class were really interesting/rewarding, I definitely feel like my eyes were opened a bit to history that is often discarded in favor of the master narrative. Only complaint was the structure of online class--Prof. Campbell basically would ask us all to talk about the reading for the day, which didn't promote discussion between peers, just a lot of hands raised with individual insights. Of course it was interesting to hear what my classmates thought about the reading, but I would have enjoyed a little more discussion. Basically your grade is composed of 2 1500 word papers and a 2500 word final paper, as well as participation and a short outline for the final paper. The first two essays were kind of boring, but the final paper is anything interesting to you, so I really enjoyed writing that.

You notice her shifty eyes and awkward, arrogant tone the first day and wonder what she's doing teaching at Dartmouth... later you realize she's very smart and articulate but has major attitude and could care less about actually teaching. Because she's an English prof, this is an English class. You don't learn about historical events or contextualize any of the material, you just read and analyze literature. The readings are very standard, seemingly plucked from a greatest hits in black history list (Douglass, Baldwin, Hughes, Morrison). Every class is discussion about the texts and Colbert provides very little direction, instead sitting there looking like she'd rather be somewhere else. All in all a very scattered and strange class. Attendance is important, and grades are entirely based on two exams. Studying for the exams felt like high school -- sparknotes is your friend again.\"",

She was born in Nigeria, has lived through the Biafran War--is a storehouse of knowledge about Africa, past and present. Yet the seminar was a great disappointment. The course was structured around a list of novels by Chinua Achebe and two African women authors. Though Professor Amadiume assigned two or three of us to give a presentation on a book or a section of a book each class period, she made the reading optional for the rest of the class. (Nine students total.) The result: no one save a few people read the optional novels, and Professor Amadiume encouraged the presenting group to spend most of its time recounting the book's plot! When the group did raise questions for discussion, no one had anything to talk about because no one had had read the book, and the few students who did read didn't want to monopolize the discussion! When we could have been having intelligent discussions--and we did have a few great and heated ones, though not when talking about the novels--our minds (okay...my mind) was going numb. And I am indeed a culprit; I recounted many a chapter of plot summary. The title of the seminar was \"Power, Corruption, Resistance in Film and Writings of Contemporary Africa.\" I expected us to watch and discuss lots of films, but we only watched three feature length films (and two documentaries--about Africa's history with colonialism and Nigeria's current situation). The films were good, but we barely discussed them! I'd have liked Amadiume to show a whole lot more feature-length films and make discussion about them a priority. We barely discussed the three films; when we did it was during the next class, when the film was no longer fresh in our minds. My third contention is the amount of writing required. I'm pretty sure that professors for freshmen seminars are supposed assign four papers, miniumum (or something around that). Not counting a one-page paper we wrote for her to gauge our writing ability, we wrote a five-page paper and a 10-page final paper. I definitely wanted to write more--if only to keep my brain active between the week-long periods of plot summaries. I was pretty ignorant about Africa coming into the class, and I did learn a lot about Africa--the dynamic between the leaders and the people, the politics, the corruption--from the films we watched, the books I read, and, of course, from Amadiume's discussions. Yet it had so much more potential! The verdict? Take this seminar at your own risk!\""
