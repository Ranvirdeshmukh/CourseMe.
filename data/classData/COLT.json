This is my second class with her, I needed the lit distrib but did not want to read full books. We are responsible for 2 movies and 2-3 WGSS theories a week. I skim most of the readings, you really only need to read 1 piece fully because there is a writing assignment to write a reflection of one of your choosing. The movies are super interesting and many are in different languages and countries which can keep it interesting! Class is all discussion based. As I mentioned are a few writing assignments throughout the term but they are very \"reflective\". Martin is just looking to hear about your opinions and experiences - the writing is all VERY informal and casual. She gives you a 100% on every assignment as long as you truly talk about yourself and how you connected with the text. The final is a group project... once again she will give you a 100% if you just put in effort and make it personal.\""

            "review 1: \"21W with Klaus Milich: Took some time to figure out how this class works, but once you get it, 100% a layup. Professor is adamant that he is \"not a teacher\" and we are not his students - we are all scholars on the same playing field (we got a whole lecture on this maybe week 2). With this in mind, he really doesn't lay out assignments like other professors do - any sort of direction is really just suggestion in his mind and that wasn't clearly communicated at the beginning of the course. I definitely understand the frustration of the first two - I was in the exact same place for the first 4 weeks and I think that's when those were posted. After talking to the prof and finding out that the 2000 word paper with a specific focus on colonialism was really just an open-ended, word-countless paper and the guidelines were just his ideas and what he would write, I kind of started ignoring the prompts to write what I thought was interesting and my grades went up. Always keep your weekends open and look ahead on the schedule - professor won't announce papers until Fridays and will make them due 4pm on Sundays. Syllabus is hard to find, but I think that might just be the fact that this class is held via zoom during covid (when I say hard to find, I mean it didn't exist for the first few weeks and only exists for about half the term, and then we pick a topic and do our own open-ended writing for the rest of the term. Prof uses \"democratic\" and \"experimental\" to describe the structure of the class and why the syllabus is mysteriously empty. Anything expected for class discussion - readings - is listed in a canvas calendar event and not in the syllabus, which is why you should always look ahead). As long as you read a bit, write a bit, and don't take anything he says too seriously, it's a pretty cool class. Again, very frustrating in the first few weeks trying to figure out the structure when there wasn't any. If you have a question, set up a meeting with him outside of class time and be super specific in your question - he's misunderstood my questions a few times and it will take a few tries before you get a really good answer. He tries so hard to help everyone in the class, and is probably overworked since he's helping so many grad students on their theses. I say it's a layup bc I can just block off my saturdays, write everything I need to for the week and read, and then it's just a matter of showing up to class and sharing a few words here and there. Huge adjustment, but he went from being my least favorite prof to one of my favorites once I figured out the expectations. One last thing - prof will also say some things that might be a little out of place. They're just (slightly passive-aggressive and not super well-worded) jokes, but all said with good intentions. Quotes include \"I need a shrink and you pay for it\" when discussing his frustrations over student citation practices, \"scholars don't 'believe'\" when telling students to cut fluff words like 'believe' out of papers, and \"next time take the computer to the shower with you\" to a student who lost track of time taking a shower and wound up a bit late to class. All of which I thought were condescending at the time, but after getting to talk with the prof and understand his intentions, I see the miscommunication there and know he means well\"",

He will tell you he hates teaching undergraduates. He will ruin your day and blame you for it. I have no idea why he is teaching since I would be a better professor. My younger sister in 9th grade would be better. He is what is wrong with Dartmouth education. At least he let us go into breakout rooms once a class because otherwise it would be intolerable. And I am handling the class comparatively well to some of my classmates.\"",

He definitely doesn't mean to belittle anyone in the class - \"I need a shrink ...\" was just meant as a funny response to our essays, and not negative at all. Maybe people haven't got great grades to begin with, but he's always totally happy to go over with students in order to help them get better and ALWAYS happy to give you the time to get better, which is what I thought college is all about ... Btw assignments aren't that unclear either - he more just lets students choose an area that they are interested in, and if you are ever confused, he's totally happy to answer any questions / confusion with no negativity.\"",

The professor's instructions were a little confusing in the beginning since he gives a lot of independence with writing assignments, and that is not something most people are used to as high school writing assignments come with a lot of guidelines. But once you realize that, you will actually really like this class. You can find your own literary texts, theories, and research papers to incorporate within your final paper. The professor was strict about things such as showing up to class on time and following instructions to a T but is a funny and understanding man at the end of the day.\""

Readings are pretty regular but some are replaced by movies (some foreign with subtitles), TV shows (Law+Order, HTGAWM), and podcasts. Resvick is very nice and engaging. Deadlines are important to her but there are very few in the class overall. Midterm gave you an option of a group podcast or an individual essay. Final was a longer essay.

The way that the readings are curated is also really interesting, allowing you to see the connections from one text to the next and appreciate them from a more informed vantage point. I would highly recommend the class to anyone who is interested in literary analysis and especially in modernist literature (Woolf, Joyce, Rilke etc.) The writing assignments are reasonable, with a weekly one page casual response paper on whatever is the reading that week, two papers (one close reading and one on literary form) and one final research paper which although longer is very open in terms of topic, so it is easy to find something that interests you to write about in length. The quality of the course and how enjoyable it is I think also depends on the nature of the discussion (the entire course is discussion based) but if effort is made by everyone to sustain an interesting discussion it can really be extremely interesting. Generally, if literary analysis is of interest to you, this class will be great!\"",

The prof was nice and always available for questions, but tough grader. Her lectures were not always the most engaging, it felt more like she was throwing information at us to then make us discuss it right away. It was not the worst thing in the world during a four-course term, but probably would have been better had it been a third course.\""

This class should be entitled \"A Postmodern Perspective on Gender Roles in our 20th Century World.\" Like, seriously. Change the description to that. This class had little to do with the city, and when I tried to steer the discussions and my own written reactions back to a city-centric theme, I was often dismissed as being off-topic. The teacher was extremely biased against males, I found, with an exception being made for homosexuals. I'm not being prejudiced here, it's just plain true. While it's okay to be a feminist, it's not okay to call out those who don't share her beliefs in class and ridicule them, as she did on multiple occasions. Just...don't take this class. If you're in a fraternity, Martin won't even take you seriously. And unless you're a bra-burning feminist crusader who doesn't shave her pits, you're in for a term of frustration and boredom. Oh, also! Postmodernism is complete nonsense. It's speculation about nothing, attempts to draw conclusions out of thin air about things that don't really exist.

            "review 5: \"07S with Annabel Martin: This class is really not at all like other classes in the film dept. It was a very heavily theory-based study of issues in the films (lit. classes) and almost none of the readings were explicitly related to any of the weekly films (2-3 films, 70+ pages of reading per week) and very few of the readings were related to film theory. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the readings--I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in exposure to cultural theory. Prof. Martin is an interesting prof. in lecture, but class discussions became increasingly banal in the second half of the class. I really wish Prof. Martin had devoted more class time to just lecturing on and clarifying the theory readings. Each week a different student group presented on the week's readings and films--this was a pointless nuisance, both in preparing the materials for your own group's presentation and in sitting through other groups' presentations. Easy, but can be challenging and quite interesting depending on how much of the assigned work you finish and how much effort you put into writing your weekly blog entries.\""

To be fair, this class apparently was easy in prior terms, but it seems that the college has cracked down. There are two things that make this class a nightmare. First, there are now four 3-4 page response papers (10% each) that you have to do, which weren't present in prior terms of this course. The mere presence of that work is annoying, but what really makes it shit is the second problem: Kadhim no longer grades any of the work himself. He has outsourced the work to bitchy grad school TAs (yeah go fuck yourself AC '21) who love nothing more but to arbitrarily take off points whenever they can. As such, you essentially have to write full-fledged literary analyses of the books, which in turn, requires you to actually read the books in critical detail. Kadhim himself is also the most boring lecturer I've ever had---his slow, slurred speech makes you want to fall asleep. His lectures are essentially just plot summary of the books, which doesn't give you deep enough details to write the literary analyses the TAs want. And, if you try to contribute to the class, he will often make fun of you for not \"speaking loud enough\" (I think Kadhim has hearing problems? Well, that should be his problem, not the students'.) Oh, and attendance is mandatory and 20% of your grade, so you have to come to class. The final 15 page paper (40%) is the most excruciating paper I've ever written. The only positive things I'll say about this course is that there are no exams (which, to be fair, certainly matters to some people) and that you can 'skip' one of the books (there are 5 books---Kanafani's Men in the Sun, Khedairi's A Sky So Close, Mahfouz's Midaq Alley, Mahfouz's The Thief and the Dogs, Salih's Season of Migration to the North---but only 4 required response papers.)

Her courses are often described as \"easy,\" \"boring,\" and a \"waste of time.\" Some Spanish majors continually search for her courses because of that easy A and light course work. Then, the way she treated the material, \"the Borderlands,\" was through, what I feel, is a very demeaning anthropological gaze that, had this been on Asian American Literature, would be termed as \"Orientalism\". She moves about the course as if this were but a mere hobby rather than a serious intellectual pursuit of hers. I think it's insulting that the Comp Lit department allows her to teach a course on the Borderlands when she hasn't really had any publications (minor or important) on the Borderlands. She does hybridity, which is not the same. She repeats the following ad naseum: \"Latino/a literature is a literature caught between conflicting cultural and literary traditions: it is Janus-faced and looks to Latin America and the U.S. at once.\" And she also subsititutes \"Latino/a literature\" with \"border literature\" etc. I disagree with that aspect, and I find the \"Janus-faced\" description quite simplistic and misleading. Latino literature is not Janus-faced because, like it's writers, it looks AWAY from Latin America. She would also tell students that they were depressed. She was also vulgar enough to tell a student that \"Minorities are pampered at Dartmouth.\" With this, I end.

The class really isn't too difficult and the topic is really interesting. Prof. Schweitzer is a great Comp. lit professor so she's very good at lecturing for this kind of class. Median was A-.\""

The material itself is interesting, but there's a lot of reading (at least for a distrib). You do have to do all of the reading - the class is mostly lecture, but sometimes there's discussion where she asks very specific questions. The workload is a 1-page journal entry for each reading you do, a group presentation, a 3-4 page midterm paper, an in-class midterm, and a 8-10 page final project (everything is 1.5 spaced, because why not). The class is NOT well organized. There aren't really assignment descriptions, and the prof isn't super helpful if you ask for assignment descriptions. There aren't rubrics and there aren't really prompts either. Lectures are not posted on Canvas, so if you miss class and don't have friends to send you notes, you just miss the material. There's currently two conflicting versions of the syllabus on the Canvas page. It's difficult to know what she wants, and because the reading journals are turned in all at once at the end, I have no idea what my grade in the class is. Overall 6.5/10, interesting but also one of the most frustrating classes I've taken here.\"",

If you want to understand the prof, find out what Bloch was talking about in utopian theory. You never read it in class but she always refers back to him... Be prepared for very little writing, but a completely unexplained two-pager around week three that she grades strangely. Other than that, the class is good: not that much work, small, discussion-based. Note to freshmen: know what you're getting yourself into if asking to join a completely upper-class COLT class. It's not impossible, actually kind of fun, but make sure you're genuinely interested in learning all about utopia.\"",

We had a two-page paper, a two-part midterm (part in class, part take-home), group presentation, and an 8-10 page final paper. The assignments were not too difficult but I think that there was some confusion as to what Professor Pastor wanted, especially with the two-page paper. The workload was manageable though and I still recommend the class 100%. Professor Pastor really knows the material and is very interested in the subject. This was a great class overall and if you have any interest at all in utopia then you should take it.\"",

Since it was capped at 25 students, it was a really great discussion environment and everyone contributed. I learned the most from the discussions and they were really interesting.

Don't miss this chance to have them co-teach your class - they are extremely willing to help and sit down and talk at length about your paper, your lives, the rain falling outside, walking across the green with the sun out... They infuse each class period with their obvious passion for poetry and two hours can blink past in a jiffy. Workload: The profs are pretty conscientious about not over-assigning reading, although what we do have to read is pretty hefty at times.\""

The problem with this course is that Professor Jewell is pretty unwilling to accept new ideas, especially in class. her teaching style is stiff and sometimes confusing. She asks questions that no one knows the answers to, and on the rare occasions that discussions occur, she continually rephrases students' comments so that they say what she wants them to say - and not just a little, the whole class will be snickering. She doesn't seem to trust the class to function as intelligent human beings - she doesn't thing the students know how to write papers, read novels, or discuss their ideas, but her condescension is pretty painful.

Most classes are centered around a discussion about the assigned readings for that class -- the discussion can be led by Nancy herself, or by a pair of students. To lead a discussion, you need to prepare some sort of in-class dynamics in order to get people engaged, make slides and an online post with some key takeaways and quotes to discuss in class, and Nancy will consider that to be a part of your final grade. The best part about it is that you really only have to do it once. Be prepared, because your peers will not read the text, especially a couple of weeks in. :) A couple of classes are workshops, to discuss the translation homeworks. In those, you get together with one or more other students, read each other's translations and offer (hopefully) useful feedback. You are expected to incorporate the feedback from the workshops into your translation explicitly (mention it in the commentary!), or Nancy will take off points. Nancy is an unexpectedly easy grader, and a very understanding lady -- she doesn't want to fail you, and she cares about any outside circumstances that happen to befall you, but she does need to see you putting in effort. You can also write the commentary in somewhat non-academic language (at least I did) and she won't really mind, as long as you are being honestly thoughtful about your own translation. The course will wear you down as time goes by, but it's a nice experience.\""

If you are so-so interested in translating, it might not be as good. Oh, and you should be fairly competent in your other language but it's not at all necessary to be fluent (you're allowed to get help from native speakers/professors of your language). You always translate from your second language into English. Otter is good. Not great. I liked her a lot at first, but I got a little more frustrated with her as time went on. Some of our readings were \"harder\" and she tried to scare us with how difficult they would be. Yeah, they were a little more theoretical, but she seemed to think we were not capable of handling them and was surprised when she realized we had understood them. She told us that our assignments would be graded more on the commentary than on the quality of our translations, though those still mattered. What I found, though, is that she would give me the final grade of whichever was worse. I mean, I guess it makes sense, it was just difficult to understand her grading. Also, she didn't like my final project. I did. I thought it was pretty damn cool.

The work, outside of the readings (which were substantial), consisted of small exercise translations and a larger final project, as well as essays/responses commenting on the translation process. Honestly none of this felt like work; if you are interested in the subject, the translations may be hard but they will not get boring, and if you've engaged in them on any level the commentary is easy to write. Professor Otter negotiates this unusual academic territory with enthusiasm and remarkable clarity, taking a personal interest in everyone's projects even if she didn't speak the language they worked with (although she knows about 6 languages). If you work with German, don't be scared away by the fact that she's a native German speaker; I worked mostly with German(although no one else did!), and although her criticism was perhaps harsher and more detailed for my exercises, she saw quite clearly the effort I put into them, and could tell when they were well done.

Of course, Prof Canepa is also an incredible woman, with great insight and an infectious passion for her trade, so much so that you can't help but be really passionate, too. She gives very thorough and constructive feedback, and if you implement it she will be quite lenient with her grading.

Unfortunately, gleaning knowledge and insight from the text is, by and large, left to the students--Professor Jewell never really seemed to have a very keen grasp on what she wanted to cover in the lectures, and would often go off onto tangents. The worst part by far, however, was the fact that Prof. Jewell constantly tried to get the class to read feminist overtones into the text. Admittedly, there is gender imagery in the Gothic--but forcing the entire class to see a lecture entitled 'Penile Procedure: Police, Detection, and Sexual Violence in the Cinema of Dario Argento' really amounted to more a waste of time than an academic excursion.

I went into the course thinking that it would focus on Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, McAlmon and other expatriates who for the most part traveled to Europe. Instead, we read about Forster's travels in India (somewhat entertaining), Chatwin in Australia (the epitome of inane ramblings), and some broad named Flora Tristan traveling to Peru in the 18th Century (made me want to stick needles in my eyes). The secondary readings brought up minimally interesting points which the class attempted in vain to discuss. Everytime one person would start to bring up a worthwhile point, Professor Cone would cut him or her off and move onto another topic. After the first or second class meeting, the discussions lost all focus, highlighting only what the professor wanted to hear or say. Oftentimes, this meant focusing only on female travel and why it was more important than life itself. To that end, she spoke ad nauseum about her own travel experiences and those of her European husband. During the discussions, she heavily favored the girls in the class, particularly anyone who had experiece traveling in Western Europe. Early on in the course, we all realized that the papers assigned were not meant to allow us to give our own interpretations of the readings, but rather an exercise in expressing Professor Cone's viewpoints and ideas. While she rarely gave out any grade below a B on a paper (one of the saving graces of this class), those who wrote papers in agreement with her consistently received higher grades than those who made arguments than ran counter to hers. I got back one paper with a comment that essentially said, \"This is well written, strongly argued, etc. But I don't agree. B+\" While I had no issues with the grade, the reasoning was so upsetting as to drive me to play pong at 3 PM, and not stop for the next nine hours. In another student's final paper, Prof. Cone returned comments suggested that he add in several paragraphs about female travelers, just for good measure. While it would not have taken any herculean effort to conform to her views and get my A- instead of a B+, the mental anguish of bending to the feminist ideals of an eccentric professor was too much for me, and I instead concentrated my efforts on expressing opinions exactly opposite of hers. Fortunately, most of my classmates felt exactly the same way. If we could not wallow in our collective misery together, I doubt that anyone would have made it through the class sane.\"",

            "review 8: \"03F with Annabelle Cone: There were times in this course that I really, seriously would rather shoot myself than be in class. This class has an awesome premise: just imagine a class about travel, exploring different ideas about it, and reading different perspectives. Now forget that idea altogether. Because what you see in the ORC or Seminar Booklet is NOT NOT NOT what you get. The course is EXTREMELY frustrating. FRUSTRATING is not even the perfect word for it. I don't know where to begin. Let me preface this by saying that I know a lot of classmates agree with me. A large number of us have 3 am or 4 am blitzes (and blitzes venting about this class from the rest of the days and nights, too, but the really firey ones happened around this time of night) in our \"Sent Mail\" boxes that are chock-full of expletives and serve as proof that we hated this class, with a burning passion. fu On that note, I must also say that Professor Cone is an amazing person. She is extremely nice and is helpful in general. Don't get me wrong. However, the Prof. tends to be very passively aggressive. I don't ever remember a time in class when the discussion was not explicitly controlled by her. If we were just about to hit a point that she didn't agree with, she cut the conversation short. Essays were chock-full of the comments \"I don't agree with you that [insert concept you were asserting here],\" and your grade would suffer because she just didn't agree with you. She is very strong-minded. No amount of evidence or support that you give your claim can please her. This class is effectively a training camp in How To Think Like Prof. Cone. You will get \"whipped\" (rather, your grade will) if you don't begin to think like her. That is sad, because frosh seminars are supposed to build critical thinking skills and foster discussion among students. None of this happened. We all came out being drones of Prof. Cone: we now think the way she does, and we only discussed what she liked (open atmosphere?...yeah right!). This seminar totally missed the point of what a seminar is supposed to be, save the small class size. The reading was, honestly, boring. I know Prof. Cone teaches French, and she must think that anything and everything French is exciting. Unfortunately, most of us don't. The French culture (of which there is none, in my opinion, compared to cultures studied in Spanish cultures, but that's a whole different issue) is known for its haughtiness, and the French reading reflected this. Have you ever tried reading the travel journal of a stuck-up, self-righteous French hag, in this case, Flora Tristan? If you haven't put yourself through this royal torture, DON'T. There was only one student in our class who seemed marginally interested in the goings-on, as she had been to France, etc. The class was also very India-centric, as we spent time on \"Passage to India\" and \"Interpreter of Maladies.\" Fair enough, though, because we were warned of that in the ORC/Seminar Booklet description. Most of the reading was POINTLESS. For example, the syllabus clearly stated that for our fourth paper, we would be writing an essay on either \"Passage to India,\" \"Interpreter of Maladies,\" or \"The Songlines.\" (Don't get me started on \"The Songlines\"--it's yet another criminally boring book.) The thing is, everyone in the class was quick to realize that there was no point in reading all three, since we'd only be so most people only read the one they were going to write on at the conclusion of the three weeks (we wasted one week on each piece of literature I just named). The discussion in class is something I've already touched on. But to put it lightly, you could discuss your heart out without reading a word of the reading assignments, SERIOUSLY! I already talked about the essay grading -- it was arbitrary and we all ended up giving her what she wanted in the essays, in order to maximize our grades, and we never once got to express our OWN ideas. Sad for a seminar. This class really has no purpose. Its theme is travel, but what about travel? We never really came to any closure or major revelation about travel, as I was really hoping to do so by taking this class. And the major positive: we got off majorly EASY on the seminar requirement. My roomate and others on my floor took seminars in which they were writing 12-page papers complete with citations starting in early October. The only paper we had to do research for was the final one, which we didn't even touch until the last week of November/December. All the others were 3-5 pagers with no extra research. We had it a lot easier than most other seminars. In that sense, I enjoyed this class because I fulfilled the seminar requirement for my degree with less effort tha0n 99% of freshmen. The travel journal, before I forget, was another utterly useless assignment. It had no bearing in our grades, so there was no point in doing it. Everyone did their travel journal the night before she wanted it--I have blitzes in my blitz account to prove it. It was a waste of time, and frankly, I could've used the time I wasted on the travel journal during Thanksgiving to kick back and relax. My last bone of contention with this class is the way essays were done. Yes, they were short and required no research, but they had no prompt. The writing prompts she gave us were so open-ended it was utterly ridiculous. You could've seriously written about ANYTHING, as long as you tied in anything from the reader (she was big on making tie-ins to the reader, for some reason or another). Even the final paper was a big joke -- there was ZERO sense of direction to the prompt (who on this Earth would consider \"Americans abroad\" as a prompt anyway?) and none of us had any idea what we were doing...on any paper. If I got $1 for EVERY time I got a blitz from a classmate the night before we had ANY writing assignment saying \"Does anyone know what we're supposed to do here? I'm lost,\" then I would be a MILLIONAIRE today, seriously. On the flip side, I made some awesome friends in this class. We went through the torture together, some of us have really bonded. Prof. Cone has great intentions with this class. She is a great person. It's just a terrible, terrible case of great idea, awful execution! If you want an easy yet frustrating way to fulfill your seminar requirement for your degree, take this class. But beware...\"",

I have heard that Prof. Cone is an excellent French teacher, but she had great difficulty guiding meaningful class discussions - she stepped back, made comments about how happy she was that we were so talkative, only to obtrusively cut in and impose her views. Several of her comments were shockingly impolite and misguided, not things a professor should say, particularly not in a first-year seminar, when freshman should be encouraged to share their views. Because of this, I often left classes feeling misunderstood and insulted. My fellow students were very friendly and had great stories to share, and I enjoyed our small group activities done outside of class. Though I dreaded discussions due to the presence of Prof. Cone, I must say the class was a learning experience - I came into contact with people unlike any I've ever known, and that in itself has value.\"",

She did not allow rewrites. A prof that definitely plays favorites (mostly with girls).\""

He has a clear passion for his subject which manifests itself everyday in class. In addition to his translation, Prof. Washburn seems to have come across every article or modern culture reference to Genji. Furthermore, Prof. Washburn managed to inspire a group of freshmen to jump into a dense text. He not only effectively lectured on especially confusing aspects of the text but encourage the students to build their own coherent discussions. Prof. Washburn was willing to talk about anything, be it Eminem or Victorian literature, in relation to the course theme. As a result, the students seemed to truly comprehend that Genji is truly a living text.

Prof. Warren grades these seriously, but you should be fine so long as you make sure to mention a few keywords she mentioned in class (make sure to check the slideshows she posts after class); also maybe even mention an activity done in class. So far, not too bad. However, the last 15% of your grade is a 3 hour final exam where you have to support / counter / quantify 4 different propositions (so essentially 4 mini essays!!) using only (and I mean only) quotes from various readings in the year. I literally wrote more on this final exam than the other 4 short essays combined---not a fun experience. And Prof. Warren won't even hand back what you got on the final exam. This is why I think the stated grade breakdown is actually useless---I suspect Prof. Warren doesn't actually grade the final exams, and instead just assigns your final grade based on a vibe check; I know several people who had >99% before the final exam, only to not end up with an A. (It's possible they just tanked the final, but annoying as that final was, I personally doubt it.) I also don't even think the median in this class is going to be an A moving forward---be warned. But really, the most annoying part of this class is that this class uses every X-Hour and attendance is mandatory and tracked (I think attendance is where Prof. Warren's vibe check partially comes into play.)

            "review 2: \"20F with Dennis Washburn: Great class. If you do the work, you will get an A. You can get by not doing all of the readings and paying close attention in class and making generic comments when called to speak.\"",
            "review 3: \"20F with Dennis Washburn: This class is a lot of work day to day if you do all the readings (~2-3 hrs/class) because we met four times a week. You get assigned a discussion group for the entire term and you spend parts of class talking with others in your group in the breakout room. Personally I really liked this format and the discussions were pretty fun. However class routinely went 10-15 minutes over and Washburn sometimes called on students randomly. Some of the guest speakers were cool, others were eh. Grading was as follows: weekly Canvas discussions (20%), 4 class projects (5% each), 2 short essays (15% each), final essay (30%). The grading was pretty lenient because the class \"projects\" were graded pass/fail and they literally took less than an hour to do. The Canvas discussions were also graded P/F and I think he was pretty lenient on the essays too as long as you had a solid argument. Overall, not a bad way to fulfill the LIT distrib but was more time-consuming than I had expected.\"",
            "review 4: \"20F with Dennis Washburn: Like someone else mentioned, this class was more work than expected for a 'layup.' Getting an A is not difficult if you put in the time. Washburn is entertaining and tries to be 'relatable to the students' (i.e. pop culture, social media, occasional swearing). Was a little annoyed that he used every single X hour, but understandable because the class is so discussion-based.\"",
            "review 5: \"20F with Dennis Washburn: One of my all time favorite classes at Dartmouth, I genuinely looked forward to class. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the readings can be a little heavy, but they're usually not that dense and very interesting. Also, sometimes we only had videos or a movie to watch for class. Would highly recommend this class if you're looking for something that really makes you think and question some of your beliefs but is also not difficult grade-wise!!\"",
            "review 6: \"19F with Dennis Washburn: \"This class is a layup,\" Professor Washburn admitted on the first day of classes. Note that \"layups\" do not imply no work. They simply mean that you are guaranteed a decent grade if you put in the work on assignments. Many people come to class not having done the readings, and they typically can BS their way through (be aware that the professor does sometimes calls on random people). This class gives priority to first-years (and is only offered in the fall), so consider taking this class if you need a layup and a way to fulfill the INT or LIT distrib and/or the CI WC. Some of the readings are dense, but there are nonetheless quite a lot of interesting readings. The professor asks thought-provoking questions that challenge your preconceived beliefs, and there are also five good movies that are \"readings\" for classes. Each group of 6-7 students is assigned a learning fellow, and they facilitate discussions. You stay in the same group for the entire term, and you also have some group projects with them, so hopefully, you get in the same group as people you work well with. If you sit at the same table with your friends on the first day of class, you will be split. The discussion entries can sometimes get tedious, but they are mostly completion-based. There are three main papers in the class, the first two of which are 4 pages, and the final paper is 6 pages. He grades relatively generously by college standards and cares more about how you argue rather than what you argue. Overall, this class does meet the expectations of a liberal arts class and is quite engaging and low-stress. You will likely have a lot of fun in this class with Washburn's sense of humor (if you can tolerate his obsessions with Japanese literature)!\"",
            "review 7: \"17F with Dennis Washburn: Unfortunately, I was taking this course concurrently with Chem 10 and Econ 1 and was consequently not able to do most of the readings. The few times I did do the readings, however, I found them interesting and mind-opening. If you don't do the readings though, you can't really participate in class. Grade-wise, just make sure you do well on the journals and the final paper. I didn't realize that each journal entry was worth 10% of the overall grade until it was too late. Because I never participated in class nor went to office hours, I did not get to know Professor Washburn very well. However, I can tell that he's a great guy (has a great sense of humor too) and is very willing to help his students with assignments, answer questions about the material, or hold discussions. Professor Washburn noted once that this class is meant to have 50 students tops \u2013 our class had 90 people. The dynamics of the class were definitely not the same as that of a smaller class and it's a shame that it wasn't. I'm sure a smaller class would've held me accountable for the reading assignments, and I probably would've participated more.\"",
            "review 8: \"17F with Dennis Washburn: This was a super chill class, most people didn't really do the readings and got by. The readings themselves are actually quite interesting, they are sometimes classic movies or just videos. I highly recommend this class with Washburn, it is a lot of fun and provokes fairly interesting discussion.\"",
            "review 9: \"16F with Dennis Washburn: Washburn is a beast. I signed up for this class after he gave a lecture about the benefits of a liberal arts education during freshman orientation. The class was large and laid-back. Washburn's lectures are interesting and provocative, so much that most people didn't have their laptops out during class. The course itself is completely conceptual with small assignments (not at all noteworthy) and one, big final paper on any topic of your choosing that relates to the course. I met some really cool people here. 10/10 would take again.\""

        "Rebecca Biron": [
            "review 1: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: Don't take this class with Biron if possible. The readings that she assigns are so dense and boring that a large majority of the class didn't even bother to try reading them by the end of the term. That being said, it's very easy to get through the class without doing the readings. She assigns a 600 word paper every other week but they're very easy to write and she's a pretty easy grader. Overall, the class isn't hard to do well in but it's insanely boring and pretty much a waste of time.\"",
            "review 2: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: I thought this class wasn't too bad. I know a lot of people in my class didn't do the readings, but I did get through them all, and they really were not that bad- maybe a bit dry but overall interesting. Professor BIron was a pretty good lecturer, and some of the guest lectures were eye-opening and pretty intriguing. The class is mostly graded on completion of discussion posts and group projects, with the exception of 4 journal entries (600 word papers) that are worth 40% of your grade. I personally enjoyed writing the journal entries, as I got to apply my own experiences to the material we learned in class, which solidified my understanding of the concepts, and going to RWIT to brainstorm and edit was also a great decision for me. Professor Washburn was a guest lecturer for one of our classes, and he was also a really engaging lectuerer, and I've heard that his class has more interesting readings so definitely recommend!\"",
            "review 3: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: Honestly, one of the best layups at Dartmouth. Although the readings on their own were fairly dry, class discussions and guest speakers/readers usually clarified what the hell was going on in them in a way that made sense, even if you didn't do the readings. Lots of little assignments and weekly projects so be careful about deadlines. The only challenge came from journal entries, which are only 600 words and worth 10% each. Biron is super open to giving feedback/discussing confusing pieces outside of class and there are plenty of ways to apply this class in everyday life. Highly, highly recommend as both a layup and course to take at some point.\"",
            "review 4: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: I highly recommend this class! Even if the readings were hard or boring at times, the class discussions were interesting, and Professor Biron is a good lecturer and passionate about the class. The class made me a better thinker and reader. Lots of the grade are from completion and projects. The hardest part of the class is the journal entries (each 10% of your grade), but if you start them ahead of time they are fine. Professor Biron is always available to answer questions and emails. Good class to take for the lit distribution.\"",
            "review 5: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: Biron is not the greatest professor, and the readings that she assigned were often super long, dense, and confusing. However, you don't need to them in order to do well in the class. The class discussions will give you all the information that you need, and the assignments are mostly completion based. You will get full credit for the research posts and projects as long as you do them and show a little bit of effort. The journals are a bit harder, but you can do well if you give them a few hours, and you can always ask for her advice during office hours. In the end, the class will be very boring, but you can get an A with little effort as long as you are good with deadlines and remember to submit assignments.\"",
            "review 6: \"18F with Rebecca Biron: Trap class with Biron. Somewhat interesting and you will learn if you dedicate yourself. I would not discourage someone from taking the class if it interests you, but I would not consider this class with Biron a layup by any means. Meets every X-hour and attendance is mandatory. Discussion posts are confusing at times and readings are dense.\""
