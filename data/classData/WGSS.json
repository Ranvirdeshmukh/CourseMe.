Towards the end of the term, there was a feminist narrative assignment that was 1500 words but it was creative and we could write about whatever we wanted, and I really enjoyed that assignment. There was a feminist analogical reasoning assignment where we had to answer 4 free-response questions to ideas we've covered in the readings, and that was probably was the hardest assignment, but if you paid attention in class and took notes from class discussion and the readings it was manageable. Lastly, we had a final take home exam with 2 free response questions that were more broad and easier to answer.

We spend a significant portion of the class discussing our personal experiences and how they relate to the readings. It opened my eyes to history and journalism in lots of different issues in ways that I never thought about (LGBT, North Korea, abortion, etc). This is also a great seminar because the paper's aren't academic. There's a 500 word narrative, another 1,500 word narrative, and the 2,500 word profile.

It is so much more of a journalism class than a gender studies class - we just read female journalists' work. The 500 and 1500 word essays were easy, but also very different from a normal essay we'd write. The 2500 word profile is a little tougher because we have to do a \"live-in\" profile on someone who is not a student or professor at the college. This means taking out time to go off-campus and interview (unless you find someone in Hanover) and putting a lot of detail. While it is a little time-consuming, writing the profile is very interesting and forces us out of the Hanover bubble. There is also a required radio commentary but that's only 4 minutes and isn't too bad. Good class to take, especially if you are STEM and need the SOC distributives.\"",

She genuinely wants her students to do well and to be aware of what's going on in the world. We'd sometimes get carried away in our class discussions and talk about Trump until there were only twenty minutes left to cover the previous night's readings. The course is also a bit irritating at times because of the variable nature of the syllabus (oftentimes students would show up to class, unaware that the readings on the syllabus had changed a day or two before without notification of any sort), and the readings journals for each class can be a hassle after a while. The material is fascinating, though, and encourages one to think about issues worldwide that are often swept under the rug in Western media journalism. The essays are unorthodox: they are not academic in nature, and they call for creativity, experimentation in form and style, and a more conversational tone (which is great news if you hate writing stiff, extensive research papers and grossly long annotated bibliographies, which it seems a lot of the other seminars require). If you're unsure about which seminar you should take\u2014if you want one that's relatively easy grade-wise but also a legitimate learning experience\u2014then take this class, no doubt. You will learn a lot, and you'll leave the class much more informed about the world (if you weren't already). And that's invaluable.\"",

Of course, you don't really have control of who's in your class, and since this is a smaller discussion course, that can be a huge factor in how well the course goes.

While the content is extremely interesting, and the small group and whole-class discussions, each Wednesday and Friday, respectively, were engaging, Professor Brooks frustrated me throughout the entire term. Even though the weekly readings were manageable, and I was constantly learning and enjoying the new facts about women in politics taught in the course, the professor was so hostile at times, making it hard for me to enjoy the content. If you make a mistake, Professor Brooks is very passive-aggressive and is not flexible. She offers \"grace\" periods for you to turn in late work, but there is so much instruction and arbitrary detail in her course that it's easy to make a mistake. Do NOT take this course if you have difficulty following rigid structures and long(er) weekly assignments. Not to mention if you'll have trouble with an uncompromising professor. Every Wednesday and Friday, you have to fill out a long \"meeting check-out form\" after class discussions which are, at times, hard to remember to do. In addition to this, you have weekly response journals and a couple of mid-term projects in addition to the readings. Response journals will take a long time if you do them well. The class initially seems like a layup but picks up quickly as you go.\""

There are 3 hours of reading on average per class plus one discussion post per class and a final paper. Orleck gives you really thorough feedback on your drafts and is very helpful in sharpening your ideas and writing, which I really appreciated.

Well, I cannot argue with either of these two stereotypes. Bronski is bar none the nicest professor I've met at this college. He is also an easy grader from what I've seen. What the reviews will not tell you is that even a straight guy can enjoy this course. Yes, being one of the few straight males in a WGST has its benefits. Beyond that, the readings are interesting and insightful (if you decide to do them, which is not necessary for success in the class). The in-class discussions are always stimulating. Yes, some people will dominate the class discussion (Foucault anyone?), but fear not jumping in to score points with Bronski. I personally have no idea what I was saying half the time, but I got some laughs (whether out of pity or genuine laughter, I'll never know). Or don't jump in, it doesn't matter if you just want an A. As for the assignments, Bronski is pretty standard on two six page \"midterms\". The first midterm was on pretty much any subject you wanted it to be. I wrote mine on the Gay vote and the 2008 Democratic Primary. He loved it... but I think he loves most papers. The second midterm was comparing an article in a 1953 Boston tabloid known for its hidden appeals to Gays to a previously reviewed material or perhaps a material not covered. Except this paper turned out to be a surprise 4 pages... The class was split into six groups. The people in the group wrote essays on the same topic, but they were individual essays. My group wrote about how the idea of a Gay community in the Boston paper compared with the idea of a Gay community in New York. The two midterms were worth 25% each. The final was worth 50% of the grade. It was 15 pages on any topic you wanted. I chose ENDA and how it split the LGB Vs. T communities. 15 pages is hard to write... haha. But with Bronski, everything is cool. You can also do a final project with Bronski's approval. I think some people made an extensive board game aimed at AIDS education. The median for the class is an A for a reason. But what that A won't tell you is how enjoyable the class was. I email with Bronski on politics every few days. Great guy, great class. Don't be a dummy... take the class!\"",

The only bad thing I can say is the papers are way too open ended for my liking. He said, \"Write your papers about anything relating to the course.\" Plus, the final is 15 pages long. If you like that, then this course is an easy A.\"",

Lim is beyond confusing, to the point of being problematic. He did not accomidate a classmate with ADHD's SAS accomidations, and even gave them extra work on top of the extension he denied. He told an indigenous classmate they needed to \"decolonize their mindset.\" The trans section of the class infuriated me, it was like insinuating being trans and drag was the same thing.

There were supposed to be 2 take home midterms that were choose 5 out of 6 essay questions (the second midterm was cancelled though, and all the other grades like the \"blogs\" which were originally supposed to be 1% of our grades each became weighted more heavily, and no revised grading rubric was given so really i have no idea how much everything was worth in the end).

She made us buy 7 books: anthologies, novels, readers etc. You don't have to read all of it. Just make sure you take notes on what she has to say about it then churn it and put in in. She loves connecting the dots, so if you skim through the readings, pick up quotes from various readings (that pretty much say the same thing) and \"weave it in\" with your own words, you'll be set.

Everyone I spoke with who had taken it raved about how wonderful it was, how it changed their worldviews. They also cautioned, every single one of them, that it really made a difference who the professor is. And it does. Professor Swain means well. Really, she does. She is a fairly ineffective discussion leader, however, and she wanted the class to be discussion all the time. Frequently the class turned into a \"men do the darndest things\" episode. We had journal assignments for each article-- and she asked so much from each article that I for one resented her and refused to discuss things in class. The journal entries were the biggest pain -- requiring hours of preparation for every class.\"",

However, neither of these ideas turned out to be true. There were women AND men in my class, and in past classes, the numbers were 50-50. Although some of the issues are women-focused, they could be broadly applied. There were also readings about class and race divisions, and men and masculinity. This class covered a broad spectrum and was, for the most part, very interesting. There were no lectures; the class was discussion based and Prof. Swain tried different methods, such as having student-led discussions. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, any grade, man or woman. It's a great overall introduction to the topics of Gender studies.\"",
            "review 3: \"02S with Virginia E.: This is one of those \"must take before graduation\" courses that should be mandatory for everyone. You'll discuss relevant issues to your daily life--i.e. the Greek system at Dartmouth, how women and men are portrayed in the media (on TV/movies/magazines/ads), intersections of race/class/gender, etc. It was definitely eye opening for many people in the class who hadn't ever considered such things before. The readings are great--stuff that you'll actually want to read. For the non-major, this class definitely isn't rooted in theory, and is more a class on gender roles in the everyday world. Both men and women take this class, and it's one of the department's prides. However, I don't think Prof. Swain had taught this class before, so she really didn't do that great of a job leading sessions. She had students lead discussions for just about every class, so she actually didn't do that much. Most of the time, she just sat back and let the students do all the talking. Her expertise is French women, so she talked a little bit about that, but other than that, students ran the class. Her assignments were also unreasonable, but I don't think she realized that until the class brought it up halfway through the course. She made us do journal entries for each of the readings (there were probably 2-3 articles a day), which was ridiculous, and of course, everyone saved them for the day before they were due. But after we complained, she changed it, so at least she was accomodating. She's a perfectly nice person and easy to talk to, but just wasn't the best professor to take this class with. So, strong recs for the course--definitely take it--but not so much for the prof.\"",

She gives wildly rambling lectures that leave you wondering what her plan for the day was, routinely interrupts students when they speak (especially, perhaps only, when their views disagree with hers), marginalizes the opinions of any student who is not extremely liberal (or willing to fake it), and also has such a poor command of the English language that she frequently asks students how to spell a word, pronounce it, or for a clarification of meaning. She requires classroom participation and weighs it heavily in her grading metric, yet her attitude discourages certain people in the class from speaking...especially men, and especially men in fraternities - she doesn't hide the fact that she is against them. She is also selfish, requiring students to go to talks where she is introducing the speaker, even when the talk is about Asian Comics and is only tenuously related, at best, to sex, gender, and society. The English thing gets me especially, because the course is a lot of writing. All told, I'm going to end up turning in 60-70 written pages of my work, to be graded by someone who has a sub-standard understanding of the language. Am I the only one who is somewhat uncomforted by that? On top of that, we're now in finals period and I have no idea what kind of grade I could end up getting - I've turned in several things, but they come back to me with comments like \"very good\" or \"good writing\" with no notion of a grade attached. Don't ever take a class with Ana Merino, unless it is a Spanish class - I suppose she may be a good professor in that department. But if she teaches WGST 10 again, steer clear.

Discussion will all depend on how much people participate and who actually does the reading. My class was fairly large for discussion so at times we would come to an awkard pause. You can get by through discussion not doing some of the readings but you'll need them for your papers. You're graded on participation, a 6-8 page mid-term paper, a group presentation (on the topic of your choosing that relates to the class), and a 6-8 Final paper. She gives you the prompt for both papers but is pretty flexible about your group presentation as long as you relate it back to what you learned in class.

It was a pretty interesting topic, and Bronski knew so much and was so excited about the material that you were forced to be interested. There was almost no reading that you HAD to do because the discussions were pretty much based on the films. The papers were graded very generously and there were revisions for every paper (even the one page ones), and if you got lower than an A- you could revise again. He always had good suggestions for papers too and really knew what he was talking about. There were 4 one page papers, 2 six page ones, and a 13 page final paper, which was quite a bit of writing, but it was spaced out well and never overwhelming, but he is also really willing to adjust timing. He really wanted to get to know his students and held a lot of office hours and meetings to talk to him about the class and your work.

This course was a good intro for literary study of gender in science fiction, although a large part of of it was dedicated to reading articles relating to feminism in general.

I think all the writing seminars are structured this way, though. I'm not sure this class helped with my writing in any way, since Moody only handed back one of my 4-5 papers, and some people didn't get any back. I think office hours would have been useful.

Professor Conley does an excellent job of showing us artwork, but often leaves too little time to discuss that artwork. The papers were interesting and appropriate, and Professor Conley is an excellent critic.
