Her comments are harsh and unhelpful and she is honestly just a terrible teacher. Every time it snowed, Prof Kane canceled class, which was fun at first and then we squeezed 10 weeks (30 classes) of writing into ~17 classes of time. Her Canvas has no grades, no assignments, and no due dates. Would avoid this class at all costs.\"",

But definitely it would be a layup, as the papers are not bad at all and it was like a total of 10 pages for the entire term. As for participation, I literally didn't do half of the readings or viewings and I just found one thing to say each class I was pretty much fine.

She would tell people they were failing the class for not participating when she literally would come up with the dumbest excuses to miss class (probably missed 20% of classes). End of story, don't take this class.\"",

She was super disorganized, never used canvas properly or even input a single grade- the only way you knew is if she emailed you saying you were failing. Her feedback on our writing was not particularly helpful- they were all comments that you can just resolve and keep her edits, but dont really give you much to think about to improve your next paper. I guess I learned a couple things here, but they are not particularly useful things, so.... She seemed nice and sweet until she wasn't (to certain people) and was oddly specific even though she gave us poor instructions. I did well in this class, but I think I just got lucky.\""

He was very interested in forming a connection between himself and his students which made the class a lot more personable during a time when everything has been virtual. I will say, however, that the readings and discussions and reflection posts get a bit repetitive.

The last week and a half are devoted to classic French films which were all really good. Grades are based on participation, short discussion posts for almost every class, and four written assignments: three 4ish page essays (on a play, a traditional text, and a film) and a creative pastiche of a French poet. Hollister is a very fair grader: if you write an interesting essay with good analysis and proofread before you turn it in, you'll do well on all the assignments. The readings and assignments are good coursework on their own, but Hollister really makes this class.

It didn't really matter what we were reading, Graziella was able to be realistic about it, change the course when necessary, and have fun with the material, which was much more fun than I had anticipated. My one concern was that it was very difficult to know what to write for the weekly two-page papers...she leaves the topics so open that many students felt lost. Never fear, you could write whatever you wanted, just write it well and then man up and give yourself the grade you think you deserved.

It is a total of three short papers (three pages each) and one long paper (five pages). Each of the short papers can be rewritten and you are then given a higher grade.

The point is that you can't possibly do all the reading he asks of you, so you necessarily are kind of in the dark about some aspects of the course. That said, the content of the course was great: if I had nothing but time to read the texts, I would have loved it. Interesting discussions, interesting authors to be read, many viewpoints and conceptions, and very befitting of the course description.

Then you write like a paper maybe two, workload is really light. Oh you journal entries too, but I don't think he really cares what you say as long as it sounds like you read. Rassias invites everyone over for dinner and is really a wonderful and caring prof, he's worth taking it even if it is boring at times. The end of the class is a lot of work though because you are divided into small groups and you present an entire 45 minute play with costumes, props, ligthing etc. but it's a really fun way to have a final project and get to know people.

The texts (Nadja, by Andr\u00e9 Breton, La Femme sans t\u00eate by Marlene Amar, Les Lettres Parisiennes by Nancy Huston & Leila Sebbar, among others) are far from what we tend to think of as classic French litterature (Hugo et al.) but nonetheless interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Conley chose texts with themes that build on and play off of one another, which I found to be one of the best aspects of the course. She also goes out of her way to be available for students so take advantage of office hours! One more word of advice: early is on time, on time is late and you do NOT want to be late, EVER!

Although PLC can be a little eccentric (he's also not great with keeping track of the time), he's honestly really funny when his jokes land, and he cares about his students. PLC would take us on field trips around Paris, so we spent a decent amount of time with him. Blanc was also a very good prof, and the class liked him a lot. In terms of workload, there's a huge \"grand dossier\" art packet, an essay, and a final for PLC's class, and I think two presentations and an essay for Blanc's. The dossier can take some time, so stay on top of that if you can; I think most people got a good grade, but a lot of us spent a ton of time on it last-minute because we procrastinated. The essay wasn't a huge deal, but the final (in-class) was honestly a trainwreck. Make sure you know the characteristics of the major art movements and can name a few major works/artists from each one. We never got our grades back, but I'm guessing I did pretty poorly. Blanc graded things fairly easily, and my grade in that class definitely helped boost my averaged overall grade. Looking back on it, I think the difference between an overall A- vs A grade for the course is PLC's final exam.

I personally was hoping to read Camus, Sartre, and St-Exupery, however these authors were avoided in favor of Robbe-Grillet, Modiano, and Barthes (if you find yourself saying \"who?\" right now, welcome to French 25!). Recommend you don't take this course unless you have to, and if you do try not to take it with Verona. Maybe you'll get a better reading list that way.\""

The books read like an overview of the 20th century schools of french thought, such as the end of romanticism, reactions to the first world war and war in Algeria, surrealism, existentialism, new novel, etc. I am not sure the professor matters all that much as the amount of class time available for discussion is nowhere near adequate to properly treat all of these books; most information will come from independent study, and the literature pretty much speaks for itself... The only down sides were that the professor used oral presentations as a substitute for genuine class discussion, and that the only writing we did was a 10 page final. I would prefer several smaller writing assignments divided throughout the term, but that's just my personal style. Overall a good course and a good prof.\""

Kogan is a very nice prof and is very enthusiastic about absolutely everything, which would have made for a fun dynamic in a more vocal group than I took this class with. I found it hard to pay attention if she was lecturing but that might also have been an effect of the comfy chairs in the Berry seminar rooms!

As a freshly-minted French Ph.D. from Yale literally weeks before teaching this class, he was totally into the material and didn't really seem to notice that we didn't follow him most of the time. He was a Philosophy major as an undergrad and that really came through in the readings he chose, but he knew it wasn't a Phil class so he pretty much let us take the bone-dry readings and do whatever we wanted with them. This actually helped me to grasp a lot of the material much better than I thought it would, which was a big plus because this stuff is the foundation of 20th-century French theory and enormously applicable to the entire spectrum of French literature. We had three presentations and two 5-6 page papers, and you could take whatever you were presenting on or writing about and just apply it to something you find interesting about French culture if it's even remotely related and he'll think it's great. Especially if you quote something from the NYT, which is his Bible. Who knows if he's going to teach at Dartmouth again, but if he does do yourself a favor and take a class with him.

The books were pretty interesting, and I guess reading 30-40 pages for every class (it was MWF, with some R x-hours used) wasn't THAT bad, even though it meant I often had to read the book like I would a book in English just to be able to finish: only going through the pages once, not rereading even if I hadn't really understood/absorbed the passage that I'd just read, not looking up words even if I'd never seen them before, and hoping that I'd absorbed enough of the gist to allow me to sound like I knew what I was talking about in class. Essays also not bad. There were four of them originally (reduced to three) and a final paper. 2-3 and 4-5 pages respectively.

I got the distinct impression that most people hadn't read the works, which wouldn't be surprising because there was really no way for her to tell. The class was really big (obviously something completely out of her control) and most of the people there were just there because they wanted to go on the spring FSP, not because they were really interested in the class or the material. If you did do all the reading, there was a lot of homework. Unfortunately, I didn't really find the authors incredibly appealing. The Hugo poems were cool, & Camus was very interesting... Professor Verona seems to have a decided preference for modern authors like Duras, whom I did not like at all. Barrage contre la Pacifique is such a depressing book & none of the characters are sympathetic at all. I wish the reading list had been closer to the one in the course guide. If you like modern feminist & post-colonialist authors you'll like the reading, but otherwise, not to much. But reading aside, the course definitely increased my knowledge of French. I hadn't had French in a long time, and I was really happy with how quickly it came back to me. You can get very little or a lot out of this course, depending on how much you put into it.

Also I found that we paid completely unequal attention to the authors: we spent less than a week on each of Camus, Hugo, Nerval and Morand, and more than half the term on Duras. Since I much prefer Hugo and Camus over Duras, I was not so happy about that either.\"",

Near the end of a particularly long book (~600 pages), we were reading upwards of 80 pages per weeknight, over 100 on the weekends. I thought it was too much. The class focused much less than I expected on the theme (heroism); it was mentioned from time to time, but it was easy to completely skirt around the subject on every single paper or project if you felt so inclined.

It's a wrap up of the grammar taught in French 1-3, a preparation in reading and writing for French 10, and an introduction to culture and civilization that is fascinating but really fast-paced if you come into the class with little knowledge or exprerience of/in France. Thereby, whoever is teaching the class, the material is going to be of debatable quality. The Grammar book we used was extremely tedious, and while it will be great as a future resource, doing reading in it frankly really stank. but i guess it was necessary. the culture and civilization book, La France Contemporaine, is FANTASTIC! sometimes there was a lot of reading assigned, but it was always interesting, especially the first few chapters of the book. Professor Beasley is INCREDIBLY willing to meet outside of class, blitz answers to questions, and has a genuine interest in seeing her students improve *if* her students show an interest in improving. If you're taking her class it is more than worthwhile to see her during office hours and get to know her, because she's a spectacular lady, but this side doesn't so much come out in the classroom (at least in french 8), so if you *don't* go to see her, you're likely to miss it entirely. Tests were really, really difficult, to be honest, and heavily weighted on the grammar side of the spectrum, but she set a huge curve and most of us ended up doing well. Definitely take this course with Beasley if you're continuing on with French.\"",

I thought she led the class through some pretty good discussions. As with any language class your experience depends on how comfortable you are with the language going in, but from what I saw the class accommodated a wide range of abilities very well. Completing the final project was easy because of the series of deadlines throughout the term for revisions of the paper. Most people who take French 8 need it as a prereq for the major, minor, or FSP, but it's also something to consider if you're interested in learning more about French culture and politics.

That being said, Wine is really nice, not that hard of a grader, and the class if fair. She's very understanding, and the work isn't really that necessary to do--skimming suffices. Another problem was that I took French 6 on the LSA, which is pretty much the same class, making this doubly noxious. One other thing was that the ability level of the students in this class was incredibly varied. One girl was a native speaker, a lot of people have lived in France, while others I think just took French 1-2-3 at Dartmouth.

The grammar was not only incredibly easy compared to AP French in high school, but we never discussed any of it and the book had no explanations. Going to class was a serious waste of time, and if I could have avoided going, I would have, as we never went over grammar, just discussed things we had read which you could've gotten simply by doing the reading; sadly, the class had only 15 people so constant attendance was necessary.

The course is boring, regardless, unless you enjoy French history. Don't take the course for pleasure; only take it if you must...and TAKE IT WITH ANOTHER PROFESSOR. Even if the professor decides to love you, you will not learn in the course, and you will leave class everyday confused by her scattered teaching style. There was no direct line of thought from point A to point B. Grammar is more poorly taught by her than anyone else I've ever seen. Even though vocab words \"learned\" aren't put into use, and grammar is skimmed over in helter-skelter ways, she'll expect you to have comprehended without any books (a good reference textbook to go with the banal workbook is totally forgone, though one exists).

Again, he wants you to do well, so he expects you to write essays beforehand and commit them to memory. kinda a cool way to learn a foreign language, eh?

The material itself moves at a manageable pace, but there are a lot of assignments so you will need to be sure that you are checking Canvas regularly so you don't miss things. Mefoude listens to the students' complaints and adjusts accordingly, so if you find that there is an unbearable amount of work, usually everyone else feels the same way and she notices it and changes things around to make things easier for you. Everything is very straight-forward and Mefoude knows the distinction between what is expected of FREN 3 students and what is a little bit too challenging, which is great. Sometimes Mefoude does get a little bit strict, but it is usually when it is noticeable that people in the class aren't studying and don't know how to answer questions, so I recommend that you study and prep in advance of class (all class during COVID is flipped-classroom style).

The students in my section voiced their concerns, and by the second half of the quarter, assignments were more reasonable and more effective. Prof. Doyle is an excellent teacher, plus she was incredibly kind and understanding, especially at the beginning when I was still struggling to speak in class and email only in French.

Fridays are normally a 30ish minute check in, where you practice talking in small groups rather than look at a specific grammar point like the other class days.

I learned a phenomenal amount of French in this class, and she really helps to review old concepts as well. Her tests aren't very hard and since she gives one every week studying for the final is super easy and not too time consuming. It was a great class and I'm so glad that I had Fabricant!\""

It is pretty easy though, except for the midterms and final, which only account for 40% of the grade. I did very poorly on them, but didn't bomb the class.

It's still interesting because Professor Burland goes out of her way to make it that way. Also, I learned a lot of small things that I didn't know before. I knew the subjunctive, but I didn't know how to use \"lequel\" or \"dont\", or \"celui\", and all these trickly little words. Drill is also amazing practice.

Madame Burland was very organized and made sure to split each class into a lesson component and then a practice component (i.e. handouts to practice grammatical changes). She was very helpful in and out of class, and although she was not the quickest responder on blitz, she did always make sure to get back to you. At the beginning of the class, she handed out a very organized syllabus that showed when x-hours were and detailed the subject of every lesson and the homework for every night, and she stuck to the syllabus almost exactly so you knew what to expect. For homework each night, we would read the lessons in the book and then the next day Madame Burland would go over them and explain more subtle details about the material. We had to write about 6 short essays, a page each over most weekends, but that was actually really easy and took an hour at most, often much less. Only one big skit at the end, but that was a lot of fun. The exams were extremely fair, she handed out practice midterms and finals that showed the exact structure of each test and the types of questions that would be on it. For the final, she even gave us the essay questions ahead of time. It was still a little difficult to remember some of the exceptions and everything, but there was honestly no excuse to do poorly on these tests, all you needed to do was study. Mrs. Burland weighs attendance and class participation and homework very heavily, so it was a lot like a high school class.

            "review 5: \"05F with Giuseppe Cavatorta: I have a problem with the Rassias method. My problem is this: Intro classes should not be immersion classes, they should be a combination of grammar learning in English, and phonetics, conversation, and vocabulary learning in Italian. There is no reason why we should not be able to ask questions in English. I was appalled by the level of teaching I recieved in Italian I. I was taught nothing. Instead, I was forced to stare at a professor who was speaking a language I did not understand, and write down what he wrote on the board, even if I had no idea what his point was. This made for a very, very, difficult term for me. As my drill instructor was technically \"not allowed\" to answer grammar questions, I had no one to ask them to. I signed up for a tutor but had no time to meet with her. I would recommend, anyone taking this class to buy the textbook a term in advance, and teach themselves the grammar, because the prof is not going to teach it to you. Beppe is a nice guy, but his version of the Rassias method is perhaps the worst teaching style I have encountered at Dartmouth. I would recommend the Russian department as a far superior department in teaching style. You are certainly immersed in the language by the professor, but you are allowed and encouraged to ask your questions in English so that you can understand the material. The grammar is explained in English so that it is understandable. I think Italian I is only easy for those people who have a spanish or french backround. For those who have studied more difficult languages, like latin or slavic languages, and are looking for a more scholarly approach to grammar and construction, they will not get it in the Italian department.\"",

I think I would have done better if I didn't concentrate as much on Chem.I wish it were an A, but I'm not pushing my luck. I am definitely considering to minor in Italian.

            "review 3: \"19F with Kelly Mcconnell: Great class and a great Prof. McConnell is extremely understanding and accommodating, but still rigorous enough to make the class a really productive one. I definitely learned a lot even though it was a very low-stress environment. The only downside is how time consuming the class is (you use all X hours, plus you have to do Drill 4x a week). However, Drill and the continuous homework make it so that you just have to \"review\" for quizzes instead of actually studying. She's also really organized with assignments and due dates, and makes everything very straightforward. Overall, would definitely recommend taking French 1 with her!\"",
            "review 4: \"18F with Kelly Mcconnell: She is super sweet and understanding with any problem you might have. Some people say its something to do with the fact that she went to Dartmouth - whatever it is, I love her. Workload is normal, manageable. You submit homework every Friday for the week and do some online exercises. Some people find it harder than others depending on your background in Romance languages or just French specifically.\"",
            "review 5: \"18F with Kelly Mcconnell: McConnell is a wonderful professor! Some of the work can be tedious but the professor is great. If you study, ask questions and complete your work on time, you can get an A.\"",
            "review 6: \"16F with Kelly Mcconnell: Sweetest professor ever, very understanding if you're having trouble. Day to day workload pretty minimal, hw for that week is due the day of the quiz/exam. Lots of in-class activity and participation but not a lot of pressure since it's interactive activities that everyone has to do. Cares a lot about her students, & will write you a great recommendation if you want to go on an LSA or FSP! Note: as with most language classes, everything is in French from day 1 which is great but a little overwhelming. Also, uses every x-hour and you have to go to drill 4x/week. Still would recommend very highly.\"",

            "review 1: \"06W with Emanuel Rota: Rota is clinically insane. His lectures are all over the place and manages to squeeze material in at the last minute. I don't really know what we did in class and I don't really know how I learned italian, but somehow I picked a bit up. But Rota is crazy in a good, fun way, I went to class less for the material and more to see what crazy antics he'd be up to. The tests and quizzes are rather straightforward and easy as long as you know what's going on.\""

She was willing to take her lectures where the class wanted to while still getting through the material in the book. She was an advocate for both France and the French language/culture. Take French 1 with Julie while she's here!\""

            "review 1: \"08F with Yasmine Renault: This was an excellent introduction to the french language. I had taken four (rather useless) years of french at my high school, and so i decided to learn french from the very beginning. I am not sorry I did. Mme. Renault is a superb French teacher, and she is clearly enthusiastic about what she is teaching. Every day, Mme. Renault hands out her self-made worksheets which summarize the concepts covered during that day. These are nearly always of more use than the book. If you want to take french 1, do everything you can to have it with Mme. Renault.\""

            "review 1: \"23W with Emily Kane: The class follows a flipped model. I spent about 2 hours preparing for each class (1 hour learning the grammar from the PowerPoints she posts and 1 hour practicing the grammar/memorizing vocabulary). The class itself was not helpful to me at all. We went over the concepts we learned before coming to class and practiced it some more, but I honestly think I would have made the exact same grades on the tests if I had never come to class. Besides that, I ended up getting a good grasp of the basic grammar concepts and learning to speak/understand basic sentences.\""
