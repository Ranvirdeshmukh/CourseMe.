But you get to work in a group of up to 6 people and the topic can be on pretty much anything, so its not that bad (just make sure you get a good group.) And, more importantly, since it's still Feng Fu teaching, this course is still mostly a layup. Everything else is mostly the same as in previous iterations. The only other assignment besides the final project are four problem sets, of which the first is literally just expository writing and the other three Fu will straight up give you the answers if you ask him (and make sure to ask Fu instead of the TAs, as the TAs won't give you the answers.) Don't bother showing up to class, pretty much nothing you do in class is relevant to your final project or the problem sets. (Just make sure to get a friend who will actually show up to class to write down your name if Fu asks for attendance; sometimes Fu does send an attendance sheet around.) If Fu likes you (he likes everyone, so it's not hard) it will be pretty easy to get a citation as well. But make sure to take this class sooner rather than later. The class getting harder this term indicates that the Mathematics department is aware of this course's status as a \"layup,\" and no doubt the department will be trying to correct for that---maybe even as soon as the next time this course is offered.\"",

I can't do justice to how good she is at teaching. Exams are difficult; save time for them. Set theory itself is pretty interesting. It's nothing like the small amounts of set theory type arguments you make in analysis or algebra; instead, you constantly find yourself trying to define a set and then realizing you can't prove that it's a set. The really crazy part is that, as we prove through the course of the term, all of mathematics (except category theory) can be deduced from 7 or 8 set-theoretic axioms that seem on their face not to say very much. Thus it's not a coincidence that you haven't seen an axiom since high school geometry-- given merely the language of set theory, with only two predicate symbols, \"contains\" and \"equals,\" we can establish all modern math.

Prof. Rockmore is very nice and cares about the subject. His lectures are sometimes unorganized and under-prepared, but he is clearly dedicated to the material and the class and is easily excited over the math, which is very nice to see as a student.

Prof. Rockmore is approachable although he clearly got frustrated sometimes by questions regarding the material or the computer programming so feel free to consult with classmates when in need of help (the prof. is very, very busy and his office hours are sometimes not as \"open\" as you might expect).

There were no tests, just homework assignments and a final project, so the class wasnt too difficult. Also, class participation counted towards your grade.

This class was a pleasant change from the previous 10 or however many math classes precede it, as we discussed neuroscience, economics, chemistry, even dating and relations hips. We learned a lot of cool things like how the Google search algorithm works and how Amazon recommends related items. The opportunity to choose a topic, any topic, of interest and explore it in depth is great, and the project is really when you learn a lot. A few pointers on the material: 1. 10A, no break - very long. Literally the longest two hours you will ever experience. 2. Homework takes forever. 3. If you are lost in class, dont worry. Just make sure you take notes, especially the formulas because that is all you really need for the homework. 4. Focus all your energy on the project - it is a great way to make the most of a class that might otherwise seem, well, random. Professor-wise, Rockmore is nice and sensitive to the students, but is almost never available, which is very frustrating in a project-driven class, in which the most important aspect of the professor's job is his advice. Again, quite disorganized, but very knowledgeable. He will speak in an informed manner on pretty much any topic - from literature, to any science, to finance, to recent events. He does not seem to be aware of how much work he is really assigning for homework, but he is generous in his grading.\"",

This diverse set of subjects really showed Prof Rockmore's teaching strengths. His classroom style is very interactive and he'd happily go off on mathematical tangents if people were interested -- this lead to an even greater diversity of material to be covered. He knows a great wealth of mathematics, and it was entertaining to see him roam. However, that was the course's main downside as well. No book contained our material, so lecture notes were sometimes the only source (although there were often articles that covered the subjects). One warning: some programming knowledge was necessary (Mathematica or Matlab were the most useful ones). It wasn't anything too fancy, but you had to be able to pick it up and deal with it.\""

I felt very good about groups. We covered them in significant depth, and I came to really understand them. We studied basic theorems (First Isomorphism Theorem, etc.), classification of groups, Sylow Theorems, group actions, semidirect products, etc. I never became as comfortable with rings as I was with groups. Some of the things we did for rings are just a generalization of group theory things, so we kind of rushed through them, but rings are nevertheless very different kinds of structures, and I never got the same intuitive SENSE for them. In particular, we talked about quotient rings and adjoining elements, and isomorphisms in this area, which I never felt to strong on; and we talked about things like PIDS (principal ideal domains), IDs (integral domains), UFDs (unique factorization domains), etc.; we talked about how PIDs are always UFDs, etc. This got to be really confusing, especially with all the abbreviations; the next time I take an algebra course I'm hoping there's a good review of this material, or else I'll have to go on Mathworld and refresh my memory or something.

Webb works at a very quick pace, writing very quickly on the board, so it is very difficult to keep up mentally during the class, as you are just trying to get everything down. There wasn't enough assigned homework in the class, so it was hard to judge how well you knew the material before exams. It would be nicer to have more, smaller assignments so that you can judge where you are. The text we used (Artin) is pretty good, but I suggest grabbing a second book as well. Overall Webb is a solid professor. He made the class quite informal and laid back, and relating the math we learn into interesting things such as rubik's cubes. He also gives glimpses into other higher math such as Algebraic Geometry, so that you get an idea of where you can go with the material after this. If you like math courses with lots of applications, and lots of quick problems to solve, this course might not be for you. If you like aspects of pure math, definitely take this course.\""

Don't be deceived. Unless you are a genius and very interested in group theory somehow, please take 31! I really don't understand why algebra is required for the major. It is so boring and literally the hardest class in the department. It is unrelated to the math that I grew up learning, and introduces like a complete new system, new language, and 100 new definitions and lemmas and theorems and corollaries each week. About the Professor JV, I would say he is better than most professors in the math department (cuz most of them suck). He is energetic and willing to offer help, and very smart of course. However, he does not know how much we can absorb each class, and throughs tooooo much new material everyday. It's like we learned 1+1 in class, and hasn't done practices like 3+5, but the homework goes directly to 56^3242-43i. Also, he might not be able to realize but he can be 10% aggressive sometimes. I am afraid to ask him questions because his face looks like \"why don't you know this\". I especially don't like the \"flex problems\" he gave us in which you write five pages to prove something complicated because for tests you can at least earn some percentages, but for this kind of stuff, I don't even know how to get started. I must add that this might not be the experience for everyone. I can tell some guys in the class are really engaged and understands what he is talking about, and I really questioned myself. Is it because I am too dumb for the major? I even considered dropping the entire major for this class. I mean for most of the math classes I took, I always did not bad.

If you want to really understand what is going on with algebra, you need to spend a lot of time thinking about it. Get a copy of Dummit and Foote and read every single section that is assigned. Seriously, just going to class is not enough. There was an incredibly long assignment (flex, Fundamentally Long EXercise) in which you basically need to write a paper proving a big theorem in the class. Voight gave three options for this, which I think was fair so that you could actually make your choice on how much time you want to spend on it. Really suggest that if you don't know latex yet, you use it for this assignment. It will make your life much easier. About Voight, he is literally the best. He is a great lecturer and incredibly energetic/passionate about the subject. He knows so much that he will always be able to answer your question. He is a hard professor though, he expects a lot from you in this class but, as I said, it is an honors class, so you should be ready.

            "review 4: \"22F with John Voight: Don't get discouraged by the other reviews - I was pretty nervous going into this class, but it was actually a lot of fun. This class is hard (it is an honors class, after all) but not exceptionally so, despite covering a massive amount of material. We went through eight or nine chapters of the textbook (Dummit & Foote) which is the most excessively-crammed-with-examples-and-exercises 20kg brick of a book you will ever see. The first seven or eight weeks were all about group theory, and that stuff wasn't so bad. I think some people got caught up by the fact that we didn't prove *every* statement (a few, e.g. Sylow theorems, were left as optional exercises) and couldn't move on from that fact. The course moved quickly so we didn't have the time to prove absolutely everything. Ring theory was squeezed into the last couple weeks. Now this is fine if you harp upon the fact that just like you can have \"rings with additional structure\" rings themselves are basically groups with additional structure, which would ease a lot of the conceptual qualms, but this just didn't happen in the class and as a result during those last couple weeks we were bombarded with definitions and results about structures that were introduced very recently and with not as much connection to what we had already learned as was probably warranted. Pretty much everyone struggled with that section of the class. In terms of work: there were weekly problem sets, a \"midterm,\" a final, and the FLEX problem (and a few daily classworks but they were mostly done in class). The problem sets were difficult but not long (5 problems each); honestly they were some of the best problem sets I've yet seen at college. They required both the knowledge gained from lectures and mathematical problem-solving ability, which made them very fun, rewarding, and effective at cementing that knowledge (especially if you use LaTeX). Each set would have one basic application and then a bunch of proofs - a few direct computations, some other more complicated things. Sets definitely got harder towards the end of the class. The \"midterm\" was basically a check-in during an X-hour to see if we could multiply permutations, but it was designed to be tricky so MAKE SURE TO CHECK EVERYTHING!!! The final was very difficult but not impossible apparently (the median was a 64%, UQ 75 but someone got like a 96??? Whatever lol). In my opinion the FLEX problem was the highlight of the class. You were given a choice of 3 important theorems discussed in class to prove in a mathematical paper (loosely 5 pages though I think just about everyone went over that), with some scaffolding provided. Grading was only *slightly* cracked. /S you could get up to a 128% on the FLEX if you chose a certain problem ANYWAY it was another very rewarding assignment just because of what you produced: several pages of fairly dense mathematical lemmas, proofs, tables, etc. mostly by yourself. Overall this class was epic. If you're interested in pure math and you think you could do this class, there literally is no contest between 71 and 31.\""

This class, however, is a little unusual in that it is more like the lower level courses, such as calculus. Essentially, the materiel is the fundamentals of calculus, so this is no surprise, but if you're not a fan of sitting down and beating little details to death using the same techniques, over and over again, this is not the class for you. On top of that, exams are all in-class (only a portion of the final is a take-home), and there are a LOT of theorems and proofs you would have to memorize. If you were really good, you might be able to derive some of these in the exam room, but you're unlikely to have enough time, so expect to have to learn them by heart. But on the other hand, classes are more interesting than most math classes, as only the first half, sometimes even less, is used for lecture, and the remainder is devoted to group work attempting to prove theorems whose proofs will be explained in lectures the next day. In short, if you like math, and in particular, like calculus, then this is the class for you. If you like math, but don't have much patience and only like the kind that is elegant and nice to look at, then take algebra. Of course, if you're a math major or minor, you'd have to take both, and if you're not, you probably shouldn't take either. So much for this review. Hope y'all have a good time in college.\"",

I was pleasantly surprised. This course is very different from calculus. For one thing, the \"flavor\" is different; the questions asked are usually not computational. Also, the topics covered are somewhat different. We talked about the real numbers. Seems stupid, perhaps, but it's actually moderately interesting. Suppose we're working within the rationals. Consider the sequence 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, 1.41421, ... This sequence doesn't converge to anything in the rationals. The reals are an effort to add in limits to sequences like this. We talked about the Dedekind cut approach to the reals, and how the reals are (up to isomorphism) the unique ordered field satisfying the least upper bound property. We talked a great deal about metric space topology, continuity (in that context), compactness, etc. We proved the Heine-Borel Theorem, which is a nice little result that's not too hard to prove. We talked about a function that's continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational. We studied a continuous function f: [0, 1] --> [0, 1] such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, but f is constant on the intervals not contained in the Cantor set (the \"Cantor function\"). We didn't talk about differentiation at all, because there wasn't really anything (in the R --> R case) left to talk about after basic calculus. We talked a lot about sequences; there was a lot to them that wasn't covered in calculus. For example, limsup and liminf. We talked a great deal about sequences of functions. Pointwise convergence of functions isn't very good; \"uniform\" convergence of functions is much better. In particular, this kind of thing is important when discussing whether the limit of a sequence of derivative functions is the same as the derivative of the sequence of limit functions. Similarly with integrals. This order-interchanging idea is important in the outside world. We also talked about an important result in approximation theory called the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem. And, of course, we talked about integrals, in particular rigorous Riemann-Stieltjes integration, and the Lebesgue theorem that functions are Riemann integrable iff they are continuous except on a set of (Lebesgue) measure 0. So you see, the topics were not at all the same as those covered in calculus, although they were of course closely related. The lectures were often fairly boring, unfortunately. But the homework was wonderful. So many fascinating problems to tackle; this is what math is really about. I find it odd that people who reviewed this course said that it was boring and like basic calculus, but they couldn't do the homework problems. I had the opposite experience. It was not like basic calculus, but with effort I could do the homework problems. Gordon's homework is always difficult (I had the same experience to a much greater extent in Math 124), but if you survive it, it makes you MUCH stronger. The more you push your comfortable boundaries, the more you grow. This course got me more excited about analysis than I thought I could be.\""

He was extremely lucid, without being too obvious. The one exception was toward the beginning of the class, when ideas of topological basis and subbasis still seemed challenging, and he said things like \"Should I write this down? It's almost too trivial to write down.\" He was very eccentric; when he lectured, he paced back and forth a little bit, and he came close to the window he would always peer out it (lol :-D). He always dashed out the door when the class ended, but I don't believe this was because he really hated the class; he just wanted to move on to the next part of his day. He also had a very amusing accent and sense of humor. Anyway, this class was good in the sense that it dispelled my previous (uneducated) dissatisfaction with topology. I thought the only topological result was that a donut has 1 hole, and that a sphere can be turned inside-out continuously, because these were the only things I found when I googled \"topology.\" But of course I was sorely mistaken on this point -- there's a lot more to topology than that. In fact, I learned in this class that analysis deals mainly with metric spaces, which are a very special case of general topological spaces. I don't know if this sort of thing is to be expected in general, but by a week or so before the end of the course, we had already finished everything Arkowitz had planned on doing, so we did a supplemental topic: \"simplicial complexes and homology theory.\" Let me tell you, this was weird, but interesting. A simplex is just an n-dimensional triangle (for example, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron), and a simplicial complex is a collection of simplexes satisfying certain properties. This was very geometrical, and fairly mundane -- just subspaces of R^n. But then the idea was that we added algebraic formalism to this. We did things like coming up with vector spaces with basis the n-dimensional simplexes of a simplex in possibly more than n dimensions, etc., and apparently these were some of the basic ideas of homology theory. All of this was great. My only point of annoyance for this course was the grading scheme, which is likely to repeat itself if you take math 54 with Arkowitz in the future. Homework was a measly 10 percent of the grade. There were four quizzes, each 10 percent of the grade. The final exam (a takehome exam) was 50 percent of the grade! So although the homework was beneficial in the sense of helping the student learn the material, it did almost nothing in terms of helping his grade. As of this point in time, I have no idea how I did in this class, because the final hasn't been graded yet. EACH of the four final exam questions was worth about 12.5 percent of the grade, so more than the TOTAL for homework, which boggled my mind. And three of the four final exam questions seemed irrelevant to the bulk of what we did in the course. One was a make-your-own topology question, which was fun but scary (because it's subjectively graded); on was on an idea that we touched on in a couple of problems in the final homework set; one was on homology theory. Only one of the questions seemed to deal with stuff that we did in the mainstream 8 or so weeks of the class, and I was dissatisfied with this.

In order to finish within the time allotted, you must work quickly and efficiently. By looking at solutions to past exams, you can see what types of shorthand might be useful, as well as which theorems are worth knowing cold. HOMEWORK: weekly assignments for the first seven weeks of the term, final project for last few weeks of term Weekly Homework Assignments: - account for 25% of course grade - lowest weekly homework assignment gets dropped - first three assignments were difficult and lengthy, taking about 15 hours each - last four assignments were shorter in order to give time to work on projects and study for midterms - lots of extra credit available - many hints and answers to homework problems in the back of the textbook - Prof. Barnett is very helpful and sometimes offers new opportunities for extra credit during office hours. Office hours were held Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and assignments were due in class on Thursday. - Homework assignments often have a significant MATLAB component. If you don't have experience with MATLAB prior to the course, you should be fine, but be sure to attempt problems in time to get help in office hours! Final Project: - worth 35% of final grade - may work alone or with a partner - typically involves some theoretical component and some numerical (MATLAB) component - must present on last day of classes at mini-symposium - presentation should be approximately 10 minutes in length (20 minutes if working with a partner) - presentation was scored out of 10 points - must also produce a write-up... archived write-ups are posted on course websites from past years - write-up scored out of 20 points - If you consult with Prof. Barnett frequently as you work on your project, and if you follow his advice, you can't go wrong! - If Prof. Barnett makes them available, look at graded write-ups from past years and note typical errors (unlabeled axes, etc.) for which Prof. Barnett deducts points.\"",

He pretty much sticks to them during class so you don't need to take notes - you can just sit back and watch him prove stuff. He is incredibly receptive to class participation - always taking questions and asking if he needs something clarified or repeated. Disregard reviews that say this class is a lot of work. It's not. The problem is that its VERY easy to fall behind. Chernov covers new material every class, and each day depends on the previous day. So if you're not skipping class or not following along for a period of time, you will be behind. However, if you come to class everyday, pay attention, and then take 30 minutes to review the lecture notes before the next class, you will understand everything clearly and will enjoy the class immensely.

The midterm and final were tough for me but you get ample time on the final (not so much the midterm). Office hours are packed but they're super useful. Like I said, the questions on both the homework and exams can be tough but the professor and grader gave lots of partial credit. First half of the class is probability and the other half is hypothesis testing. Some R is used on homework, but mainly for one-line functions that require no programming knowledge (CDFs, PDFs, and quantiles).

Textbook is dense but if you read the lecture notes and then skim the sections of the text where you are confused it is sometimes helpful. pretty minimal use of R, but was slightly tricky at first. he lets you use literally anything you want to compute stuff tho, R is probably just easiest.\"",

The material, particularly the probability-based stuff in the first half of the course, is really hard. But at least this term, I didn't think this class is as bad as previous reviews said. Lee started off teaching really fast and confusing, but he took student feedback after the first few weeks and slowed down to write out everything on the board. He always paused for questions and somewhat attempted to check in by writing some complicated shit on the board and asking, \"are you ok?\" He isn't trying to trip you up like some STEM profs do-- he just wants students to learn and engage with the material and is trying to figure out how best to do that. The homework was hard but if you go to office hours it's definitely doable, and was sometimes just copy paste examples from the textbooks. Exams were based off of homework and seemed generally fair and were actually not only open note, but also open internet where you can literally use Chat GPT (it was the time constraint that messed with everyone). The class material is very theoretical and reminds me of CS 10 in that it will train you to answer job interview questions but data science edition. Overall, you learn a lot of fundamentals of statistics and not so much how to apply them to actual data analysis. I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you really want to learn that, but if you need to take it for a major/minor tbh it's really not so bad.

The extra credit was 5 points (0.5% each) and there were maybe like 10-15 opportunities. It may have moved the needle for ~3 people in the class. 2) the course was not dominated by math theory. most homework problems were application problems and one homework set focused on being able to make simulations in R. 3) Lee did make jumps in the lectures but that's because we simply did not need to fully know the proof behind some certain concepts. We just needed to know how to apply it. 4) I thought the online textbook was fine if you go to libgen.

The first half of the course covered probability concepts while the second half was more focused on statistics. The class is definitely more theoretical than applied, and we only used some basic R functions to calculate probabilities and such (this is not a class for learning R if that's what you're looking for).

He doesn't accept answers that are only \"half right,\" which is admirable; but he also gets upset when nobody wants to take a shot at his questions (creating an obvious dilemma) which results in awkward silences and a hostile classroom at times. (I started taking notes just so that I could seem engaged and 'too busy to answer' at times.) The material in this course is interesting -- it has high potential to be a good class. He reviews concepts from Math 20, which solidifies the basics of statistics; and he then extends that knowledge into a multivariate setting, which is then continued in Math 70. We had weekly problem sets that took us hours, and a 24-hour takehome midterm and final (which sounds great in concept, but terrible in practice) that took us over 18 hours to complete. The material really builds on itself, so falling behind isn't really an option. This course also requires R programming knowledge, which Professor Demidenko does not teach.

Get to know him, show interest in statistics, and ask questions in class. (Don't get too offended by any of his jokes. Most of them are just Russian sayings that translate poorly into English.)

I entered this class thinking it would be a piece of cake, but it was actually quite challenging and made me re-evaluate my understanding of some of these subjects that I had already studied before taking the class. Whether or not you are a math major, I highly recommend the course, although this review's value may change depending on the professor.\"",

Matt writes the homeworks you did not deliver on your midterm before giving your midterm back to you and there is a 1000% chance that he will have lost homeworks that you already handed in. There is not even a clue about this on Matt's syllabus but a week before the final project is due, Matt sends out an announcement saying that you now have to write a 15 page academic paper on the final project that \"you have already done\". We had a senior prof visit the class once and he was confused as to what Matt was trying to explain in class.

This is the first math class that I've genuinely enjoyed in quite some time, largely due to the energy and enthusiasm Matt brought to each lecture. You can tell he's clearly passionate about the material he's teaching, and he often strayed from straight lecturing to allow for participation that helped to drive home key points\u2014we conducted a mock-Monty Hall problem for an extra credit opportunity, watched clips from Good Will Hunting and solved problems from the movie, simulated models using computer programming, and spent a whole day gerrymandering Ohio. He introduced examples that I often found myself thinking about days later because they were that interesting. Even though his lectures could seem a little bit all over the place at times (as mentioned by other reviewers), I think this is strictly due to Matt's liveliness. He remained organized throughout and focused on one topic at a time, and if you copied down everything he wrote on the chalkboard and completed daily homework assignments you'd have a pretty good understanding of the material. Also, he's super approachable. I missed a few classes for athletics, and he set aside a meeting to personally teach me the material one-on-one. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the daily homework were really useful\u2014it often forced me to think outside the box to come up with my own examples to demonstrate and fully grasp key concepts. Weekly homework could be a pain, but probably because I just started them too late sometimes. Exams were very fair, and worth equivalent to the weekly homework. The one criticism I could make is with regards to the final project. Matt mentioned it often throughout the term, but did not provide much guidance on choosing a topic or how to conduct \"research.\" He was pretty hands-off and kinda just told us to write a 7-12 page paper (longer if working with a partner), which was worth a fair portion of our final grade (midterms each 1/7, WH 2/7, DH 1/7, FP 2/7). This is his first time teaching the class, however, and he takes feedback as a survey at the end of the class, so I imagine this would be improved in future terms. This class would likely look very different if taught by a different professor, but I would strongly recommend it if ever taught by Matt Jones again. He's awesome.\"",

That being said, take it with Trout. Those who disparage him aren't math majors I'd bet. He's one of the best math lecturers here. We spent multiple lectures on certain topics within this subject (e.g. continuity) to drill in and explore the topic in depth when I know for a fact that some other lecturers would only spend a single lecture doing so. We only went up to chapter 5 or so of the book and finished at the fundamental thm. of calculus when in previous iterations of m35, they went up to chapter 7 and covered power series. This shows that we actually went super slow. Secondly, we did go over proofs in detail in the lectures and people gripe and they say he went through at light speed, but you're not really supposed to understand the proof from just seeing it in lecture. 1) He's got 65 minutes to cover a shitload of material. and 2) I think these kids just want to understand the concept from just seeing it once at lecture. Unless you're a genius, if you're seeing it for the first time, you're not supposed to understand it fully right then and there. You're supposed to look at it later on your own time.

The question I think many people got tripped up on was a proof based one, including myself, but I looked at the solution and it seemed really simple and used methods from a homework problem in a more tricky, advanced way. tldr; I think if you really went over the homeworks and did a few extra problems yourself from the book, I think the exam was very doable.

Had I NROd the class, I would've enjoyed it much more because the subject matter is fascinating and satisfyingly builds up to proving the FTC. Unfortunately, this is an extremely hard course. While the content is easier than 63 (tedious exercises like axiomatically constructing the reals are skipped), several factors make this class - at least with Trout - a difficult alternative. First, exam difficulty. The true/false section destroyed most people because it was littered with tricks and vague questions. (ex. There was a question about whether there existed a natural number N with the property that N epsilon > 1 for all positive epsilon. The obvious reaction is yes by the Archimedean Property of R since the wording suggests an epsilon is fixed then N is chosen. The actual answer is no, since epsilon can be a function of N.) The median on the midterm was a 70, and while Prof. Trout promised a retroactive curve, one person managed to score a 96, so that curve couldn't have been much. The final was a slightly easier (e.g. fewer ambiguous T/Fs) but overly focused on minutiae from HW that weren't covered in class (e.g. Lipschitz continuity), including for two major proofs. Second, pace of class. The only people who could follow along in class were the few pure math whizzes (who probably should've been taking 63 instead) or those who laboriously previewed lecture content from the textbook. He zips through proofs of major theorems at lightspeed, giving equal pen time to simple arithmetic as to leaps of ingenuity, which were much more easily digested by studying his written notes. Third, harsh grading. I've never seen this level of nitpicking before. Graders would deduct points from homework without explanation or for reasons unrelated to correctness. The same applied to exams. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and if it were graded more reasonably, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.\"",

Furthermore, the proofs seemed to be a little different than other proofs I'd seen because they use more tricks. Once a new trick has been introduced, you'll see a lot of it, so it's not so bad. All in all, an excellent class if you can take some proofs and want to get a (little) glimpse at the foundations of mathematics.\"",

My biggest criticism of the class is its lack of focus. You never really know what you're going to do in class or what the end goal of the class is. Despite his lack of organization, Prof. Doyle is always enthusiastic and funny, and keeps classes interesting. The majority (probably entirety) of the grade comes from the final partner project, which is honestly super fun and interesting. Prof. Doyle gives you free-range to pick basically any mathematical topic and explore it. It's a fun project and it's awesome to see all the other groups' work at the end.

You sit around for 2 hours listening to Prof. Doyle's anecdotes, playing with children's toys, and watching movies, and at the time you just feel like you're hanging out and not working. But at the end of the class, looking back, I realised that we learned a shitload of material: about knots, graphs, manifolds, wallpaper patterns, polyhedra, you name it. The homework is pretty light, and the main assessments are two quizzes and the final project. This class is one which is easy to not take seriously, and I feel that this was a mistake that many people made. In the homeworks and the final project, students were given the leeway to work as hard as their curiosity and intellectualism took them, and I have to say that the majority of students just half-assed their work and their understanding of the material. Their loss, because we covered some really great stuff, and this course will only teach you as much as you put into it. Doyle really cares about how much effort and earnest interest you put into the material, and that's what he grades on. Unfortunately, a lot of math majors are used to just working for the grades and have little to no real interest in learning interesting subjects in mathematics.

Even if you haven't taken a math course since high school algebra, you'll do fine in this class. There's one project, and a few easy quizes, and that's it.

And then in class he'll give hints and then you try to solve it again. Now and then he gives a little quiz, but the quizzes are far easier than the homework. There are some prerequisites, but I hadn't done them. I've taken math 8 and math 13 so far and this class had nothing to do with them. It's not difficult math - usually just counting - it's just things your brain isn't used to thinking about like 4 dimensions. And Peter Doyle is cool. He's very informal and funny. He seems totally disorganized at first and will teach you six different things that have nothing to do with each other, but eventually you realize that it's six different ways of looking at the same thing.

Also, the computational/coding problems were a nightmare. They added zero aspect of number theory to my knowledge. I was thinking of dropping that course since the weightage they carried (even the final exams) were pretty high, and it skewed towards people who already knew coding.

The material is interesting and Arkowitz is a great prof, it's just a really really tough class. The hardest part is the tests. We had 4 tests during the term, each consisting of only 2 questions (1 computational, 1 proof). The problem is that this a proof-intensive class, but you're never really taught how to write them. It just takes practice, but when they make up half of each test grade, it's kind of rough. The final was a take-home, but don't get too excited. It was REALLY hard. Leave LOTS of time to do it.\"",

            "review 1: \"08W with Craig Sutton: Ok. First off, I love math. It's always been my favorite subject, and I am most likely going to major in math. This was the first experience that made me question that. Linear Algebra was so hard and required so much time outside of class, that I can honestly say I would rather have taken 22 if I could go back in time. Sutton is great. He lectures well and is easy to talk to, so no problems there. Where it gets tough is the homework and tests. The focus of the class is proofs, which, from my experience, is something you either have or don't have. More than any other aspect of math I've encountered so far, the proofs in Linear Algebra require a certain creativity that goes far beyond simply \"enjoying math,\" and if you don't have that creative spark, prepare to be in pain. As someone who struggles with proofs (of this nature), each homework assignment literally took 10+ hours. In addition, I found it necessary to attend both office hours and the TA's office hours for the full duration (each about 3 hours), every week, just to be able to complete the homework. And apparently the rest of the class did too, because the office hours were often attended by 10 or more of the 15 students in the class (again, just for the homework). The tests were fair. The material covered by exams never went far beyond the scope of what we had learned, but the fact is, in a 9 week term, there is simply so much information thrown at you, that memorizing every proposition, theorem, corollary, lemma, (and the proof of each) is a more than daunting task. I received the worst grades of my academic career on the two midterms, (failing the first). Note though: as one of only four (?)freshmen in the class, I was definitely one of (if not THE) weakest links in the class. In short: Do you like math? Did you rock AP BC Calc in high school? Did you even do well in Math 11/12 here? All of that means nothing. This course is monstrously hard, so if you have no other choice but to take it, make sure your other two classes are all but negligible in the amount of time and effort they require.\"",

Writing proofs is much different than doing calculus and many students in the class struggled to get the hang out it for a while.

There are weekly problem sets that require a lot of time and I often found myself leaving whole problems blank. Sutton holds office hours which are tremendously helpful and there is a TA who is great. Sutton was certainly available to support his students. There are two midterms which were difficult but took problems from the homework almost exclusively--still very difficult. By the last week I felt confident, just in time for the final. Don't take this just to see what linear algebra is all about. It is hard at first, moves quickly, but worth the effort. Strangely interesting at times too. You learn why you studied matrices in sixth grade, which is nice.\"",

Direct quote: \"How do you write a proof?\" \"Best way to write a proof is to just write a proof.\" And then I bombed the first homework because I didn't know how to write a proof. This happened a few more times, even though I went to lengths to try to make this class work - I worked with friends on every homework (checking each problem to see that we had the same work, although even with nearly exact matches I still only received half the points my friends did and no one could explain why), I started googling problems for tips, I contacted the tutor clearinghouse 3 times for help (they didn't respond to me until a week after I dropped the class, RIP), AND I worked with a study group leading up to the first midterm. Dropping this class was the best decision I've made for my mental health. Like the other review says, nightly homework takes a significant portion of your time (I had to set aside around an hour per problem to write and triple check). The lectures are optional, and from what I remember, they weren't really worth going to unless you were 2 days ahead on reading and understood enough to actually ask a question. He regularly schedules more into a class period than he can fit, although I will say he was very punctual and made sure that we left on time no matter where we were in the lesson.

That said, this was by far the most rewarding class I have taken at Dartmouth so far. This was the first proofs-based class I have taken, and I believe this was also true for most of the other students in the class. Professor Williams did not really explain how to do proofs, but in all fairness, there really is no way to teach someone how to do proofs. It sort of just comes with practice and lots of trial and error. The class had a lot of hw assignments that, as some other people have mentioned, were extremely time consuming. I probably spent ~10 hours per week on them and reading through the textbook (which prof follows religiously), although they were worth a relatively small portion of our grade. However, it was through doing the homework problems that I learned to do proofs: it really just takes practice. Most of the course grade comes from tests, which are very long and difficult. However, at least with the online format, they are all open note so how you perform really just comes down to how well you understand the material and how well you can do proofs. I completely BOMBED our first exam, but after lots of practice and diligently going to office hours, I got the hang of writing proofs and ended up doing well in the class. Again, not for the faint of heart but this class will give you a really good sense of whether you want to continue math by throwing you into the deep end. It will also give you a great foundation in linear algebra and writing proofs. Professor Williams is very nice, but a little strict and unapproachable at first. However, he is very good at breaking down the concepts and explaining the material (if you read the textbook and do the hw assignments). He also responds to emails quickly and holds lots of office hours where he will walk you through the assigned homework problems step-by-step. Overall, I'd give the class 9/10, but don't take unless (a) you don't care about your grade that much, (b) love math, or (c) are just really looking for a challenge!\"",

Linear algebra is a beautiful subject, and I personally think Professor Williams does not do it justice by being unapproachable overall and being an extremely harsh grader. Watch 3Blue1Brown to appreciate the subject. Homework is also ludicrous, taking upwards of 10 hours per week. He is, however, one of the smartest individuals you will ever encounter in your life.

I am now questioning my math major on account of this class. Of course, this class is kind of like a gateway to the math major...so it's kind of unavoidable if you're interested in the major. Professor: Prof. Groszek is super nice, and she really, genuinely cares about her students. Her teaching style probably isn't for everyone though. For every class, we would read a section (occasionally 2) of the book and essentially teach ourselves. Then, in class, we could ask questions about the material, and we worked on practice problems. She would also sometimes go over the major points in the chapter, but I really don't think you could get away without reading the book. (While this was a tedious way to learn, I feel like I learned the material very well because of it.) She's very good at answering questions, though. She is also very good during office hours and really makes an effort to meet with you even if you can't make it during the scheduled office hours. Workload: I found this class to be a TON of work. I'll tell you exactly what a typical week looked like so you can judge for yourself. For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: Reading 1-2 sections of the book (usually 1) for each class; each section was anywhere from 6-18 pages, I would estimate. (And it's very dense reading; you are essentially teaching yourself when you read for this class.) Also for M-W-F there are 3-ish homework problems from the book (which take longer than you would expect a mere 3 problems to take, because some might be proofs) ---- the homework problems from a full week are formally due all together the following Monday. Due Mondays: \"Special\" Homework - a proof that can sometimes be quite time-consuming. If you don't get credit, you can rewrite it (which creates more work). I think we ended up having five special assignments all term, total. Every Monday: Quiz - all these quizzes are totaled up to give another midterm grade. WARNING: There are take-home components to the midterm and final. These are SO time-consuming because they are mostly proofs, and they are HARD proofs. So the workload was huge. But, I will say that none of it felt like busy work, so that's a plus. I would say only take this class if you are seriously interested in becoming a math major.\"",

While he seems to like math, he is desperately unable to convey that and constantly reads off premade slides he took from his colleague Dana Willaims. Interestingly, the premade slides are copy-pastes of the textbook. No proofs were done on paper. Used a document camera(rather sloppily) instead of better tools. - Professor is unnecessarily aggressive on homework. Very particular too, detracts points when he doesn\u2019t like the way you did something even though it may be completely correct. Despite it being a theory class there are many trivial calculations on the homework where you lose 10% of the grade for a wrong final result. He also seemingly doesn\u2019t understand that if you prove something for all X, it actually holds for all X. He often detracts points for not having \u201cSPECIFIC\u201d examples. - Did a pretty terrible job answering questions, you were better off visiting math stackexchange or learning on your own. Goes over time almost every single class. He seems like a nice guy personally though, just not a good teacher. - The book is so-so. Not terrible but nothing particularly well-done. Short sections that seem like they were written as a chore. The same amount of enthusiasm as the professor, which is to say, absolutely none. - Homework was barely related to anything in class and did little to reinforce any knowledge. - Math department has some serious thinking to do. Take it w Shemanske, sounds like he is the only decent prof teaching this class. I remain convinced that math theory can be fun and immersive even if hard, despite this disaster of a class. Learned almost nothing from class. Completely useless. DO NOT TAKE unless you want to self-study linear algebra and you have the time to do it.\""

But given this is by far my favorite subject, I don't think this class was as interesting as it could have been. Prof. Pauls was, in some senses, a very good teacher. He was clear. He is extremely knowledgeable in his subject matter. He did a superb job at understanding students' questions and answering them in ways that they could understand. Sometimes, I think it is tough for professors to anticipate a lot of the questions that students are going to have and respond in a way that is meaningful; Pauls could, and this was impressive. However, his lectures were a little bit dry. He somehow did not help spark an interest in differential equations; any interestingness was a result of the fact that the subject is inherently interesting. Above all, we were rarely laughing in his class. My best teachers and professors had a great sense of humor, and this was not the case with Pauls. Finally, his lectures were not spontaneous; he worked off of note cards that he had done ahead of time, and we took down notes, and at times in this process the professor almost seemed superfluous. Another problem was how fast this course was. It is silly goal to try to work through the entire diff. eq. book in 10 weeks. I actually had a course in differential equations previously that covered the first five chapters of this book, so I was glad of the speed at first, but once we got to new terrain it became tough, and I could only imagine how difficult it was for my peers. Also, trying to cram the entire subject into 10 weeks meant that we skipped large sections of the book. We barely glanced at chapter 4, and never glaced at all at chapters 6, 8, 9, or 11 (the last chapter). I will have to go back and look at these chapters myself, and it's a lot easier to learn the material in a classroom setting than alone. A couple of really good things about this class: the homeworks and the book. The homeworks were absolutely fascinating. Pauls did a good job of picking good problems, and some of the ones he didn't pick were good, so I did them as well. The book provides a lot of fascinating little \"tidbits,\" gems of mathematical knowledge, difficult things that the student can work through step-by-step, etc. It also has some historical background on the mathematicians who are mentioned, which I found interesting and useful. On the whole, this was not a bad class -- we did a lot of wonderful things and I come away from it having a much clearer idea of how mathematical modeling is done. However, it could have been slower and more thorough, and I feel that Prof. Pauls could have inspired more interest for the subject.\"",

Take it, survive it, and try to learn as much as you can without becoming discouraged at the seemingly useless material; you will indeed use this stuff, particularly methods for solving partial differential equations, as you will see those often in physics.\"",

I know that I will be constantly using what I learned in this course. The presentation of the material, however, could have been better. A huge positive aspect of Professor Pauls lectures is that he presents all of the material that one needs to know in class, so that one can easily get by in the course and understand everything well without reading the text, which can be combersome and confusing at times (especially with notation). It is also evident that Professor Pauls spent time preparing his lectures. The biggest downfall of the lectures was he presented the material so fast that one could barely keep up with writing down notes, let alone take the time to correct one of his errors on the board or let the material sink in. There were two things, though, that really turned me off from professor Pauls teaching. The first was that there were two HUGE errors on the take home exam which he had to correct in class after the weekend. There were also two errors on the final which had to be corrected during the exam. The second turnoff was his complete inaccessability via blitz during the period of the take home exam.

Picture a notebook full of cryptic equations and more Greek variables than you can shake a stick at. As a result, it took me at least four hours to complete every homework assignment, no joke. Every Tuesday night, Thursday night, and Sunday night was spent entirely on Diff EQs. Thank God for Naomi Davis, the TA who saved our lives and was wonderful, clear, and always patient!

Prof Glaubitz is a great explainer, and also brings some nonchalance to his teaching which disarms you and makes you really enjoy the material, and the same is true for Prof Gelb. The class was pretty easy, both in terms of the difficulty of the material and the course load. Course load was probably the lightest for any Math course I've taken so far at Dartmouth with one weekly homework every week (lowest score is dropped), one group assignment (new for the online section) every week, 2 midterms and 1 final. I think the grading scheme is rigorous as the weightage increases throughout the term for the exams (100 pts for midterm 1, 150 for 2 and 200 for the final). Overall, great course and highly recommend taking it with Prof Gelb and/or Prof Glaubitz. Finally, this course is meant to be taken after Linear Algebra.\"",
            "review 5: \"20F with Anne Gelb: This class was co-taught by professors Anne Gelb and Jan Glaubitz. It was remote for 20F, and over Zoom Gelb would lecture Monday mornings, Glaubitz on Wednesday afternoons, and the Friday lecture was asynchronous. I liked both professors, they definitely knew the material, however I think they (like most of us) were still getting used to remote classes. Lectures went at breakneck speed (at least for me) and I found myself struggling to write down important things in time before we moved to the next slide. I like to attend synchronous lectures if I can, but a few times I had to rewatch the lecture later and pause just to write everything down and have a chance to understand the material instead of just focusing on writing down important equations. If I were to do this again I'd just go asynchronous from the start so I could pause and go my own speed. There was weekly group work with a 10 min presentation of our answers to one of the profs on Friday. I was blessed with a good group so this was a good thing and helped reinforce material. Weekly problem sets through WebWork with unlimited attempts, which really helped take the pressure off and give you breathing room to get to the right answer eventually. Linear algebra was not a prereq for this class, but I think it definitely should be as a significant portion of the class deals with eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrices. I had taken math 24 previously so I was alright, but I knew a couple other students who hadn't and were struggling to learn basically another class worth of material just to understand what was going on. A fine class overall, but I feel like it would have been much smoother in person instead of remote.\"",

            "review 2: \"21W with Timmy Ma: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS OR ANY OTHER CLASS WITH TIMMY MA. Take it with anyone else (but I wouldn't recommend James Ronan either honestly). Let's start with the schedule. The class with Timmy Ma was in the D block and the class with James Ronan (they co-taught and combined them kinda) was in the E block. This meant that they decided to have synchronous classes that were unique in BOTH blocks. So we would have a lecture on Monday D and a discussion Monday E, then a discussion Wednesday D and a lecture Wednesday E (so if you had a class in the other block you were semi-screwed). They did record the lectures, but never the discussions, which began their pattern of doing things that they are *technically* allowed to do, but really shouldn't because they are putting students at a disadvantage. So you may think \"oh, I don't want to do an extra two hours of class I didn't sign up for, so I just won't go to the discussions.\" Don't do that, because Professor Ma will get petty that no one showed up and he will ask an insanely difficult question in your group assignment (which is also bogus but I'll get into that) that he might've covered in the discussion that week, and when no one can spontaneously answer a question that he changed and expected you to modify on the spot, he will make sarcastic comments like \"you should've come to my discussion then.\" Also, it should be noted that by combining these courses, they increased the class size from 18 to like 40 all so they could be lazy about the way that they taught. Next up on my list of complaints: Professor Ma's attitude. He often won't respond to emails and is condescending in 1-1 meetings during his office hours. He types when you're talking usually doesn't pay attention, and it really feels like you are inconveniencing him by reaching out outside of his hours. I once requested a meeting by email, and he ignored my request. He literally declined to speak with me. Following that, they announced that they were having the final FOUR DAYS BEFORE. And no, they didn't have it during the scheduled time for the class. They put \"TBD\" on the syllabus and then announced on a Sunday that they were having it Thursday-Saturday. This screwed over a lot of people, because the Thursday-Friday period was the \"break\" period determined by the registrar, and therefore many (like myself) scheduled to travel home on these days. The final was worth 30% of the grade. I could've used a week's notice. Then, they give our final back and give us less than 24 hours to request regrades. And it was a Sunday-Monday period because they \"had to get the grades turned in,\" even though the grades weren't due for another week. Once again, they failed to give us an appropriate notice. Now let's get into in-class experiences. I taught myself this course from the book. In the lectures, they read off PowerPoint. The powerpoints are IDENTICAL to the book, so if you read the book, there is literally no point in going to the lecture. Second, in the discussions, there is no structure. It's not like another course where they prepare problems for you to do. They serve as additional TA's of sorts, answering questions in confusing and unhelpful ways. Lastly, the group projects. Every Friday, you and other students would present the solutions to a pset that you did during the week. Prof Ma would randomly call on one of you to explain the problem and official write-up that you and your group did. Then, on the spot, he would change the problem, or ask a hypothetical about the problem to test your understanding. Some of these were really fair and easy. Others, not so much. It's also super unfair IMO to ask someone to immediately generate an answer to a different problem (some of these took like 10 minutes the first time). I will take a moment to acknowledge a few nice things that this course offered: the WeBworks had unlimited attempts which was nice, and the tests were untimed and given over a long interval, which was also nice. I considered dropping this class, but I thought I would get the grade I wanted based on the standard grading scale, and my current standing in the class. I wish I had because they modified the scale and published it AFTER THE FINAL, to look like this: 94-100 is A 90-93.9 is A- 85-90 B+ 70-85 is C <70 is C- I read layup list for math 3 about TImmy Ma's condescension, rude attitude, and inability to work with students. Students at UC Irvine (his previous position) also agree: he makes the test insanely hard, doesn't really teach in class, and is rude when a student asks questions, despite asking if students have questions. I didn't heed the warning of layup list before. Please please please learn from my mistakes, and heed my warning now. Don't take math with Prof Ma. TLDR: Essentially, this course taught by these profs was a series of moves that they were *technically* allowed to make, but really really shouldn't have because it a) made them look really lazy and b) screwed over students. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF PROFESSORS.\"",

Even worse, he wouldn't tell us / help when we were struggling, but rather just tell us how much we were messing up. I don't regret taking this class, as it is useful, but it wasn't very fun or interesting to me.\"",

At first, I was like \"whatever, I just won't volunteer in class anymore\" since I was among the few who did anyways, but I realized later it really honestly made me feel stupid. I thought it was just me for a while making a big deal about it, but I ended up talking to a few people in my class afterwards and they admitted that he was just unnecessarily harsh. I've never dreaded class time more than those Friday group presentation days where I know no matter how much preparation we did we would still be made to sound stupid. After the first time where we butchered the random question we came up with on the spot, his advice for next time was to try to anticipate the questions he was going to ask on the day: he was quite literally asking us to read his mind. I've heard bad things from the people in Ronan's section too, but if anyone ends up in Ma's class, remember you are not as stupid as he makes you seem.\""

I once requested a meeting by email, and he ignored my request. He literally declined to speak with me. Following that, they announced that they were having the final FOUR DAYS BEFORE. And no, they didn't have it during the scheduled time for the class. They put \"TBD\" on the syllabus and then announced on a Sunday that they were having it Thursday-Saturday. This screwed over a lot of people, because the Thursday-Friday period was the \"break\" period determined by the registrar, and therefore many (like myself) scheduled to travel home on these days. The final was worth 30% of the grade. I could've used a week's notice. Then, they give our final back and give us less than 24 hours to request regrades. And it was a Sunday-Monday period because they \"had to get the grades turned in,\" even though the grades weren't due for another week. Once again, they failed to give us an appropriate notice. Now let's get into in-class experiences. I taught myself this course from the book. In the lectures, they read off PowerPoint. The powerpoints are IDENTICAL to the book, so if you read the book, there is literally no point in going to the lecture. Second, in the discussions, there is no structure. It's not like another course where they prepare problems for you to do. They serve as additional TA's of sorts, answering questions in confusing and unhelpful ways. Lastly, the group projects. Every Friday, you and other students would present the solutions to a pset that you did during the week. Prof Ma would randomly call on one of you to explain the problem and official write-up that you and your group did. Then, on the spot, he would change the problem, or ask a hypothetical about the problem to test your understanding. Some of these were really fair and easy. Others, not so much. It's also super unfair IMO to ask someone to immediately generate an answer to a different problem (some of these took like 10 minutes the first time). I will take a moment to acknowledge a few nice things that this course offered: the WeBworks had unlimited attempts which was nice, and the tests were untimed and given over a long interval, which was also nice. I considered dropping this class, but I thought I would get the grade I wanted based on the standard grading scale, and my current standing in the class. I wish I had because they modified the scale and published it AFTER THE FINAL, to look like this: 94-100 is A 90-93.9 is A- 85-90 B+ 70-85 is C <70 is C- I read layup list for math 3 about TImmy Ma's condescension, rude attitude, and inability to work with students. Students at UC Irvine (his previous position) also agree: he makes the test insanely hard, doesn't really teach in class, and is rude when a student asks questions, despite asking if students have questions. I didn't heed the warning of layup list before. Please please please learn from my mistakes, and heed my warning now. Don't take math with Prof Ma. TLDR: Essentially, this course taught by these profs was a series of moves that they were *technically* allowed to make, but really really shouldn't have because it a) made them look really lazy and b) screwed over students. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF PROFESSORS.\""

Ryan teaches like he's in a room full of first-graders but tests like he's working with college students... i wouldn't mind the latter if i felt like i had more than a very basic grasp on the material.

Additionally, the book used in this course is also very clear and quite readable so learning all the material isn't a problem. A TON of homework is assigned and it's graded for accuracy so to do it all correctly takes an enormous amount of time. I wouldn't say the amount of homework assigned is overkill as it is necessary in order to fully understand and reinforce concepts it's just a lot of work to do all those problems on such a frequent basis. Finally, tests were on the challenging side. I wouldn't say they were unfair, but they definitely made you think and apply the concepts we had learned. If you're good at math and keep up with all the work (reading, lectures, and homeworks) you should do fine. In the end, I found the course to be interesting and stimulating--I'd recommend it.\""

I felt like his classroom was an inclusive environment and enjoyed being there. He was also extremely available during his office hours - I would visit him multiple times a week to ask him questions. His tests were not easy, but they were fair. I was able to get above the median on all of them without destroying myself studying. I will say, this class has a lot of homework. Webwork and problem sets will take you a few hours each week - but they really aren't particularly difficult.\"",
            "review 3: \"23W with Daniel Rockmore: Personally, I didn't really like MATH022 with Rockmore that much. Objectively, he's not terrible though. He does explain things reasonably well, tries to make an effort to know students, and places an greater emphasis on applications over theory. However, I always got the sense that some of his mannerisms were disingenuous---for instance, he would always tell us to ask questions, but the way he said it made it sound like he was annoyed and didn't actually want us to. His handwriting on the chalkboard was also pretty much illegible, and his written notes (which were only intermittently released) were all over the place. So one way or another, you would end up relying on the textbook to learn---not ideal. I do also agree with the other review that Rockmore had issues working with technology, however the bigger issue was that it took the TAs upwards of four weeks to grade anything. As for the course structure, a really annoying thing is that exams total 70% (20% Midterm 1 + 20% Midterm 2 + 30% Final), rather than 50% total in previous versions of this course. Luckily, there are some free percentage points in discussion posts (in a math course??? lmao), and that the problem set problems are more or less copied from the textbook, and you get a cheat sheet for the exams. But I don't think that makes up for the tougher exam grading percentage. I disagree with one of the other reviews regarding exam difficulty - I would say Midterm 2 > Final > Midterm 1 from hardest to easiest. True, Midterm 1 is calculation intensive, but it's pretty much just row reduction and \"pivots in rows vs columns\" properties. However, Midterm 2 is a nightmare with about five weeks of content PLUS additional applications crammed into one exam. Yes, Midterm 2 is \"just short questions,\" but they require really precise answers - it doesn't feel as if there are many free points. The final isn't as bad after going through Midterm 2. Overall, I would agree with the other 23W review that Rockmore is \"overall not the worst, but definitely not the best.\" (But I guess that's just the math department at this school for 'ya.)\"",
            "review 4: \"23W with Daniel Rockmore: Rockmore is a nice guy and not a bad prof, but if you can take this class with a better professor you probably should. The biggest problem was course technology--he did not know how to use gradescope, canvas, or webwork which resulted in a lot of unnecessary confusion. For example there were times when he would post different questions for different assignments, or he would confusingly create assignments with similar or the same names. His lectures were also not the most helpful, and by the end of it some me and a decent amount of the people I knew were self-studying for a lot of it. A good thing he did was teach us a lot of applications, which from other reviews I can tell is not the case with other math 22 profs. Overall not the worst but definitely not the best.\"",

            "review 6: \"22S with Daniel Rockmore: Though this was his first time teaching in a while, Rockmore did a pretty good job with this class in my opinion. In general, he explained things well and held office hours often enough. He tried to make things more interesting by sprinkling in applications that we wouldn't be tested on throughout the entire term rather than only teaching the applications that get crammed into week 9. I personally learn much better from textbooks than from exams so I stopped attending towards the last couple weeks and still ended up being fine. In terms of exam difficulty, I would say that 1st midterm > final > 2nd midterm, from hardest to easiest. The midterms felt a lot more calculation intensive than the final, which had a lot of smaller/short questions. The homeworks and webworks were generally straightforward, if not a bit tedious on a couple occasions. Do note that since past terms the weights assigned to exams vs. homeworks have changed slightly - previous reviews say 50% exams, 50% everything else, but as of this term exams are worth 65%, making it a bit harder to get an easy A compared to past terms.\"",

In terms of learning the material... I found Professor Rockmore's lectures hard to follow unless I had done the reading beforehand and was fully awake. When I was unable to follow the lectures, they seemed to drag on forever. When I was able to follow the lectures, however, they didn't seem long at all. Rockmore did use every x-hour, and I was fine with his doing so-- it allowed more time for applications. The textbook is very good. Make use of the book's CD-- it contains valuable answers (and complete explanations) to several odd problems that aren't in the back of the book. Between Professor Rockmore's lectures and the textbook, I had very little trouble learning the material. I visited Professor Rockmore in office hours a few times. He wants students to do well and is willing to work with students until they really understand the material. Office hours were not very regular... understandable given everything in which Professor Rockmore is involved. Nevertheless, Professor Rockmore succeeded in making himself available often. Grading was fair. Professor Rockmore said during the first class that he wanted everyone to get an A... he doesn't curve, and the exams were generally more straightforward than tricky. Additionally, the practice exams very strongly resembled our actual exams. The workload wasn't bad at all... there was a weekly set of about 30 problems that helped to teach and reinforce the material. With the exception of a week with over 50 problems, everything was quite reasonable. Overall, I am very satisfied with the class and the knowledge I gained. Highly recommended.\"",

In office hours, the professor said he couldn't put questions similar to the ones we'd seen in class because he expected students to cheat. However, for those of us who did not cheat, this made the exams very frustrating and difficult. The professors did not give enough relevant practice for exams, and often failed to post answer keys. For the second exam, they gave us a link to a previous class's practice problems and told us the problems would not be particularly useful.

There may be topics on the final that do not appear on the practice, and there may be topics on the practice that you won't see on the final.\" This answer key was not helpful for understanding how we did a problem incorrectly if we got it wrong.

The discussions were nice, but only because most of it was between students that were trying to understand this course. The discussion between students and the lecturers were sometimes very unproductive, although that wasn't entirely the case with me. The lecture notes were sometimes very messy and hard to to understand. This especially applies to Dr.Petok who has been notorious (not only in this course but others as well) for bad handwriting and convoluted explanations of things. The workload was fine, the psets were managable, and the webworks had good problems. But the test papers were awful. Not that I found them hard (in fact quite the contrary), but it seemed as though that Dr. Petok, the person who I think designed the tests, didn't even remotely try to make the material resemble what was found on the homeworks. Some of the problems, except for those that were familiar, often times had obscure proofs and the ideas behind them were not really taught out during the course of this term (although the techniques were certainly applicable). Bad reflection on the learned material overall. Overall, I had a terrible experience in this class. I don't regret learning linear algebra, but more rather taking it under these lecturers.\"",
            "review 3: \"20F with Jack Petok: This class was awful. Jack's lectures were completely worthless. They were extremely disorganized and hard to follow. Jack spent way too much time on easier topics and not enough on challenging ones. His handwriting was so terrible that at times I genuinely had a very hard time following what he was doing. Halfway through I stopped watching lectures and switched to reading the textbook instead. My performance in the class increased as a result of this change. Additionally, Jack did a poor job of preparing us for the tests, which were much harder than the problem sets and the problems we did in class. The class was also extremely disorganized and it was easy to miss assignments because the communication was so terrible. With a better teacher, I might've learned a lot in this class. As it was, the class was a waste of time and money.\"",
            "review 4: \"20F with Jack Petok: Speaking from the perspective of someone who has taken various other courses in the math department, I believe that a lot of the comments on Prof. Petok's instruction are exaggerated because students underestimate the difficulty of Linear Algebra. The class is fundamentally difficult because it focuses on a different space of math that is not seen in the previous calculus sequence. This course was honestly well-organized with pre-recorded lectures available for the whole week with office hours replacing synchronous sessions except on Wednesday where the professors hosted a problem-solving session. Anyone claiming the professors were not available during this time just did not attend these office hours because they were always there. Very few people attended on average, but, if you were there, you would always be able to ask a question that you had and learn from what other people didn't understand with the material. Additionally, if you actually made an effort to email the prof, the prof is accommodating to meet outside of class and will provide responses to questions on the material that you have. I would agree with others that the profs did not do their best in providing solutions to practice exams, but that this is standard practice among the math department with most profs not even willing to give practice exams. The solutions provided gave the general idea for how a student could approach a problem to get the solution, its steps, and the correct answer, so the only thing missing for the solutions to earn full credit is the written out links between each step which was the purpose of their disclaimer. Other course reviews also comment on the proof vs. application in the class, but completely fail to understand how the professors gave a lot more computation work in webworks, homeworks, and exams while still providing theory for individuals to have a greater comprehension. I know this for certain because my friend took Math 24 and, comparing between our work, there is a lot more theory in 24 with exams having little to no questions that simply ask students to compute matrix solutions and rather theory on abstract vectors which we did not have. The class also had a generous curve at the end to reflect exam difficulty (which is par for course in any linear algebra course where class averages fall somewhere between C-B, not just this one). Lastly, lectures reflect a lot of the textbook which is the same for other standard math courses in the department and won't change until you hit electives. To learn the material, reading the textbook and utilizing Paul's Online Math Notes (you can find linear algebra by searching it up for Cornell because someone hosted it there) is more than sufficient. Bottom line: do not be afraid to take Math 22 just because it may be with Petok because the concerns that other people had about the course are reflected in any version of Math 22. The course is so standardized that the differences between professors between terms for Math 22 are not that drastic compared to what you might find in the intro chem sequence for example. Just don't take the course with a bunch of other hard classes because you will be in for a rough time since linear algebra is not easy for anyone.\""

I would highly recommend taking the class with literally anyone else, but if you have to pick between the two, Professor Petok is marginally better. Neither of them can clearly explain concepts, so the lectures were not helpful for understanding course material. They clearly did not put a lot of thought into the lectures, and often just repeated the information, including examples, from the textbook. I would have just read the textbook, but occasionally there were things in the lecture not in the textbook, so most of the time I sat through the lecture completely lost and then read the exact same material from the textbook. They were sometimes available during office hours, although often late, and could answer about 5 questions total during the hour. There was a class piazza for asking questions, although the professors rarely checked it and if they did, often failed to give a helpful response. I got the sense that they cared very little for this class and did not care whether or not we learned the material. The tests were not a good reflection of what we covered in class. In office hours, the professor said he couldn't put questions similar to the ones we'd seen in class because he expected students to cheat. However, for those of us who did not cheat, this made the exams very frustrating and difficult. The professors did not give enough relevant practice for exams, and often failed to post answer keys. For the second exam, they gave us a link to a previous class's practice problems and told us the problems would not be particularly useful. For the final, the answer key was released after the last office hours (so we couldn't ask any questions on it because they stopped answering the piazza) along with the message: \"Sketches of solutions to the practice final have been posted. The solutions are simply there for you to check your work; they do NOT represent solutions that would necessarily receive full credit if graded, because the work is not completely shown. There may be errors as well. A reminder that the final may or may not resemble this practice. The distribution of topics could be totally different. There may be topics on the final that do not appear on the practice, and there may be topics on the practice that you won't see on the final.\" This answer key was not helpful for understanding how we did a problem incorrectly if we got it wrong. Additionally, this class is supposed to have applications (I am taking linear algebra as a prereq for CS classes) but we did 2 applications the whole time. The class was very proof and theory heavy. We covered a lot of abstract math concepts. If you are a CS major, I would definitely recommend taking it in the CS department.

            "review 1: \"16F with Alexander Barnett: Math 22 is 90% lecture, with 10% doing problems at the end of class on a worksheet. But for an intermediate level math course, what form of teaching could be better suited to cover the material? Overall, Math 22 was somewhat interesting and fairly efficiently taught. After every lecture, 12 or so ungraded practice problems/proofs were assigned in the section of the textbook covered during the lecture (these problems roughly 3 hours to do) Some students, often to their disadvantage neglected to do these ungraded sets. Otherwise, there was a weekly graded problem set (which took about 2 hours to do), two midterms and a final. While the HWs and tests were well made, Barnett\u2019s lectures could be improved. Alex Barnett reminds me a lot of myself. If I was a professor, I would probably be similar to Barnett in a lot of ways, so I can't criticize him much. I will say I though, that his lectures can definitely be improved a lot. His lectures seemed a bit disorganized and his explanations were not always the best. He would always try to write down everything he said on the board. Often he would have been better off writing fewer things down and saying things out loud without writing them. Alex Barnett was out for a week and I had the opportunity to have the other professor, Nanobe Tanabe hold two lectures. I thought her lectures were as a whole cleaner and better organized than Barnett's, even if her lecturers contained fewer jokes and were a bit drier. I remember returning to my dorm after two of Barnett\u2019s lectures where he went through fairly difficult material only to find the material was not in the textbook and all I had to study from was 2-3 pages of notes. Though this only happened two times, it still could be frustrating. One day in class we covered Markov Chains and the Google Page Rank algorithm. Though interesting, the material was tricky and not in the textbook. Barnett was gone for a whole week to Europe and we had a problem set due on Markov Chains. I went to the TA office hours, hoping the TA would have access to the solutions. The TA didn't have the solutions, nor did she do any of the problems herself and claimed to just be there to help us through any of the problems. When I showed her the Page Rank problem, she could not help me. I received very high grades throughout the term, but on that homework I did poorly. In fairness to Barnett, I could have seeked help from Professor Tanabe's office hours or from other students, so it is mainly my fault. Though the lectures could have been improved, I cannot say the same for the practice material and HWs throughout the course. I really liked how we did practice problems out of the textbook after every lecture instead of doing WebWork. I really wish the Math department, and other STEM departments also for that matter, would realize that online auto-graded homework is not that great of a learning tool. Professors like online homeworks because they cut down on paper, and \"incentive students to try harder\" by grading assignments that previously would not have been graded. Yes online homework may cut down on paper. (In my experience many students end up printing them out anyways because it is easier (not to mention healthier) to read a printed copy). But in my experience they do not incentive students in a positive way. With online homeworks, unless your solutions are perfect, you get no credit. So it takes a very long time to do each questions, so professors generally assign fewer question then they would from textbooks, which equate to less practice. But more importantly, when you are only graded if your solution is perfect, many students feel the need to go to TA sessions or to other students to get the solutions. Some may consider this to be beneficial group learning and teamwork, but in reality it is typically just inferior learning. Rather than solve the problem on your own, you get the answer from someone else. On the test you won\u2019t have the opportunity to get the answer from someone else, and as a result your performance suffers. Also, when professors assign online homeworks, they often don\u2019t go in order through their course textbook. This makes it very difficult for a student to study for exams or review material they are having trouble with, as it can be tedious to use the textbook when it includes things we haven\u2019t covered or we cover things it doesn\u2019t cover. So in the end, I strongly advise STEM departments to consider going back to the old fashioned textbook for nightly problem sets.\"",

Not only can he square decimals in his head (and then apologize for rounding off at 4 or 5 significant figures), he can also think and write out proofs on the blackboard just as fast as you can write them down - even the most complicated ones, done entirely in his head.

The problem was the prof. would cancel office hours without informing the class ahead of time, would not respond to e-mail, and he admitted that he had very ambiguous and ill-defined standards for grading, all making for a horrendous experience. If you are a potential major, skip this class (at least when offered by this prof. since the other ones seem to do a good job with it) at first and take something in the 20's. If you like it, then keep going. And keep an open mind regarding the pure math classes vs. the applied math classes.

Regarding the iteration of this course with Professor Miller: this term, the topic was on randomness. The first six weeks was on probability theory which was relatively straightforward. However, the last three and a half weeks was on computability theory, which was pretty much impossible to understand (even for a CS major, which is what the person writing this review is.) It was even more impossible to seek outside help on computability theory, as (for some reason) there were very few resources teaching computability theory and the few that were didn't use the same terms that Professor Miller used. Luckily, this class is a layup grade wise: everything is take-home, including the midterm, AND you can redo every assignment for 100% points back (except on the midterm, which is only partial points back.) The core of the class is weekly problem sets. Most of the problems are proofs and they can become kinda tricky at times, but if you go to office hours and ask (or rather, wait for someone else in class to ask), Professor Miller will most likely give you the answers. There's also a final project + presentation, but you can do it on pretty much anything math related (and it can be expository too; for instance, you could write about the Prosecutor's Fallacy in a social context. The final project doesn't have to be a formal mathematical proof.) If Professor Miller ever teaches MATH017 ever again, I would recommend taking it in particular with him. Just keep in mind that this course isn't necessarily a layup time wise; you might spend more time than you want in the later weeks of the course. Also keep in mind that you probably shouldn't take this course if your maximum math ability is MATH 3 or 8 or something a-low those lines, but that should go without saying.\""

I felt as if this was the math I'd been waiting my entire life to do. Almost every lecture was engaging, and I would frequently find myself quietly discussing the material with the people around me during class. Just about every week, we would learn something so intriguing or artful that the person I sat next to and I would turn to each other and mutter, \"That's so cool.\" Orellana was a fantastic professor (until she gave birth halfway through the term). She would consistently examine the class, gathering feedback from our facial expressions, making certain we all understood the material. Her examples were clear, complete, relevant, and they helped me learn the material. Weber's teaching was also excellent -- we were all expecting much worse, but Weber's lectures were only slightly less clear than Orellana's.\"",

Both Prof. Orellana and Prof. Weber were great, and I should add that the ratings above apply to Prof. Weber as well (she took over about halfway into the term). They do have different teaching styles though; Orellana goes over material more slowly, catering to the lowest common denominator in the class (though not in a tiresome way), while Weber goes a bit faster and might be the better prof for those who keep abreast of the material.

Witty, clear and enthusiastic about class.\"",
            "review 2: \"16S with Thomas Shemanske: In short: Shermanske had the midterms graded very unfairly, but he made the homeworks and midterms much easier than Math 8, which made the class much less stressful. Math 8 was very frustrating in how its homeworks were very tedious. In Math 13, everything was much more straight forward and closer to what was done in class (as a high school math class would be). But that is not to say the course didn't have its frustrations. My biggest problem lies with the second midterm. The grading on the second midterm was absolutely absurd. I understand the math department puts pressure on their professors to keep students grades down, but that doesn't mean the a professor should put major questions on the test where 80% of the students will get 100% wrong. The second midterm had a question where you thought it was set up for you take a shortcut, but actually, as few students realized, you couldn't. You could have done the whole question that was worth 15% of the test right after making that one initial misunderstanding and still lost every single point. Why was no partial credit given? The first midterm, on the other hand, was very reasonable. The questions made you think hard about how to solve them and as a result the scores made an even distribution. But in the second midterm, most people got around the same grade because all the questions besides the trick question were very easy. A few people of course did exceptionally well just because they caught the trick question. That massive point difference does not accurately reflect students understanding of the material as it disproportionately helps some students over others. It gets even more frustrating, on the last question of the test, the professor must have felt that students grades needed to be lowered even more, so he allowed his grader to take off points on a proof for containing extraneous information. My answer contained the extraneous information, but while taking the test I realized it did not support my answer so I did not reference it in my explanation, but merely kept so as to show my work. I went to his office to explain this, and he said that to increase my score he would have to regrade all the tests and this was too much. This policy, that points could be taken off for extraneous information was never mentioned in the directions. Most of the students had never had such a grading policy before. It was obvious that he was just trying to lower the median, but he should do so with harder questions, that can show a difference in students scores, rather than just a trick question to lower everybody's scores as a whole. Besides this unreasonable grading, while Shermanske was very systematic and organized, he did not seem to have as deep of an understanding of the material as did the Math 8 professors and as a result, we simply learned the theorems and methods of integration without proving or analyzing the intuition behind them. Many students asked him questions such as \u201cWhat is the intuition behind this?\u201d and he did not give great answers. He also made a lot of use of powerpoint slides, which I find are not an effective medium for teaching math.

Also, the first third of this class is very much a repeat of many math 8 concepts, so make sure you either took math 8 or at least reviewed the material before taking this course. Despite all the difficult theorems, the course does somehow come together and sort of make sense by the end.\""

The pace of the course was great (much better than Math 8 or 11). The class spent just the right amount of time on each subject, and allowed students to really absorb the topics and ask questions. The homework was all done on paper (no webwork is always a plus). There were two \"pop quizzes\" near the beginning of the term, but they weren't worth many points and again, there were only two. The exams really weren't that difficult or surprising, especially if you put in the work to do the supplied practice problems and ask questions in office hours. Zach really took the time and effort to make the class fun and engaging (not just lecture but group activities), and made time (in and out of office hours) to make sure that each student fully understood the concepts. This was truly one of the best math classes I have had at Dartmouth and a big part of that had to do with the teacher. I was able to fully understand the topics in class and tie a nice bow onto the end of calculus. On top of that, I was able to have conversations about higher math topics with the professor, really dig into the material, re-fall in love with the subject and full send into being a math major.

I read the reviews and decided I was up for a challenge, but I really had no idea what I was getting into. First of all, the material is tough. It just is. You'll have to listen closely in class and practice over and over again to master it, especially if math doesn't just \"click\" for you. And it's at breakneck pace -- you learn a new concept each day and falling behind is not an option. I recommend working in groups, this made homework considerably easier and helped everyone get it. Your peers are your greatest asset here. Take advantage of the TAs too, they are usually helpful. The exams were too inconsistent. The first one was easy and everyone did well, and the second one was mind-bendingly, cripplingly difficult to compensate. Thankfully, the class is curved at the end so you don't have to do well, just better than the pack. In the end, it turned out okay, but this course caused me more consternation than it was worth. It was definitely rewarding to feel like I know multivariable calculus, but that knowledge came after TONS of work. I did fine, but not without a huge investment of time and effort. And sometimes that effort came at the expense of enjoying freshman fall. In hindsight, as someone who never intended to major in math, I shouldn't have taken it. If you just want to finish the calc sequence, take Math 11. It's hard enough.

If you do the homework you get pretty comfortable with the techniques. Some of the written assignments were pretty hard, but he's always available to help during office hours. The surprise came with the final exam. It was REALLY hard. I suppose theoretically you could do all the problems with techniques learned in the course, but they were far more involved than anything we'd practiced.

This course is entirely proof based; Pauls basically stands up and briefly covers a topic, then goes on and spends 40 minutes on a proof that isn't necessary for you to understand the topic. I think part of the problem was that proofs don't really help me learn, I need a verbal explanation of a topic, and that was in area in which Pauls was particularly weak.

Basically all you are taught in class are the theories and concepts behind various formulas (theories and concepts which will help you prove these formulas later), but you don't get ANY example problems, so if you don't understand one minor detail, you're sunk.

Other schools do multi-var over a whole semester or longer).

A day before the exam, we had an in-class review session where we went over all of the topics that would \"be\" on the midterm. The next day, the only thing on the test was integrals of difficulty not covered by the textbook, or in class. Prof. Pauls has a habit of saying one thing and doing another; for example, he will tell you that if you don't know or can't do something on the exams, you should just write that and move on. He said he would not take off many points for such cases. However, exam after exam he took off major points, and would take off more points if you wrote that you couldn't do something. He also has a habit of taking off loads of points for simple computational errors. However, that being said, Prof. Pauls is generally good-natured and covers the material very well. Some of the topics are indeed interesting. The Webwork (online homework system) is frustrating at times, but really helps you learn the material. Also, a majority of the people in this class were extremely talented. It was difficult to compete with them. Do not dismiss my grievances as whining because I got a bad grade--I was on Math Team in high school, did well on the AIME, and did well in Calculus BC.

Take the B curve in Math 11 over the B+ curve in Math 12, trust me. If you are not an AIME/USAMO-level person, a person with a strong calculus background, or a person who has already taken multivariable, do not take this course no matter how well prepared you think you are.

Math 11 has multiple choice tests of not so much difficulty (I took a sample test and scored pretty high), while Math 12 is always all open-ended and very difficult. Also, you never know what you're going to get on the tests. Our second test was half in-class and half out-of-class with 1(yes, 1) question worth 50 points out of a 100. The material tested was definitely not indicative of everything we learned in the class. It became a hassle to figure out what we need to know for the test and what not to. Also, unlike other classes, no practice test is given, so you go in almost blindly about the material on the test.

            "review 10: \"07F with Vladimir Chernov: WARNING: This class is very challenging and the tests are very hard* Professor Chernov makes this class. He has a fantastic sense of humor and he is extremely responsive in class. Most of the lectures are spent in proofs, which can sometimes be tedious but other times interesting. If you are not interested in proofs and care mainly about the practical side of calculus, don't bother to take this class. But if you are looking into the possibility of a major/minor, it is worth it. The class is a great introduction on proofs and gets you comfortable with the style and approaches. Workload is separated in online and written homework. Online homework is straightforward and identical to Math11 homework, with some additional problem sets which are usually more challenging. The written homework is an out-of-control train-wreck through hell. Very challenging. Find people in the class to work with unless you are a mathematical genius with fantastic intuition. Also, it is graded mercilessly. When you get homework back it will look like a used maxipad. The tests are also extremely tough. You cannot afford to miss a single question or make any silly mistakes. But in the end I feel it has been worth the challenge. You will finish the class with a very strong command of all the material, and an introduction of what a math major/minor path may be like. And you will get to know Professor Chernov, who is an amazing guy. *COURSE GUIDE ADMINISTRATOR NOTE: OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE IN THIS REVIEW WAS REMOVED. *THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BY A 2013 FOR A COURSE OFFERED IN 2007.

However, I'm glad I did, because this course was a great refresher before taking more math courses. The professor, van Erp, is clear, funny, accessible, and understanding. He doesn't expect students who don't have an interest in the course to show it; he allows students who already know the material to skip class (an opportunity I took advantage of liberally); and his lectures are as interesting they could possibly be for multivariable calculus. The course itself, math 12, is almost exactly the same as math 11 (and presumably 13), but with a strong focus on proving the things you learn and proving a lot of properties. The last two days of lecture focused on an abstract version of the entire last chapter of the course, which was really interesting to me. Workload wasn't bad at all; I'm glad I took this course.\"",

Most of the lectures were just about the normal m11 material, with a few different angles that would not be introduced in the non-\"Plus\" class. I would have considered this class a waste for me (I quickly found out I was not interested in proofs), except for an interesting and very insightful topic (differential forms) we learned on the last two days of class, which made it totally worth it for me. Take this class if have already taken in high school and want to retake it for an easy class (I was disappointed at how many people did that, skewing the curve and not really learning anything new), or if you are interested at getting down and dirty with proofs and an interesting integration technique in a smaller class. It is not a lot more homework than Math 11, but the exams are much harder. I have no regrets, other than the fact that due to the hard exams and experienced people in the class, I did not achieve the best grade. But it was worth it.

I remember feeling so much relief on the days I walked into class and saw that someone else was substitute-teaching the class that day-- both the grad TA and the other professor were better teachers than Lahr. They handled the material better, answered questions, and acted professional and respectful to students, which is more than I can say about Lahr himself. Professor Lahr is intolerant of students' questions, often treating them dismissively and with barely concealed scorn. He is not above mocking students in the class about their questions, comments, or even ethnicity/accents. There were times when he felt his knowledge and status of superiority in the class was threatened by an intelligent student comment, and he clearly acted defensive, condescending, and dismissive of the possibility that he could be wrong. Additionally, there was an incident in which he was extremely unprofessional-- a student had asked him to sign a withdrawal slip, and to do so, he placed the slip on the computer projector in full view of the entire class, and was completely unapologetic when the student asked that he move it. I felt like the atmosphere of the class was unwelcoming and unhelpful, and that Lahr was an uneffective professor. I stopped going to class after the first few weeks because I could not stand him, and I did just fine with the book.

The class is marketed as being perfect for people who got a 5 on BC in high school, but that is not the reality. I altered my schedule to take this class with Chernov because his reviews on this website were great, but I realized too late that the reviews were from 2004. They were very much not up to date. Chernov can be a funny teacher, but the entire class is him just introducing new concepts with limited examples and little to no time to process everything that he just said. He would ask a question and before most of the class had the time to think about it, it would be answered by 1 of the same 3 people then prof would move on. It seemed as if he was just reading off of his lecture notes and copying everything down because there would often be mistakes in his work that took way too long to fix or explanations that weren't satisfying. I would not take this class unless you plan on majoring in math or something else that will require you to take multiple math classes. The work necessary to put into this class to just achieve the median is insane, and you can only excel if you have had previous experience in a multivariable class, which puts everybody else at a disadvantage. Save yourself.\"",

Webworks were annoying but weren't too bad when I didn't procrastinate. Same deal with assignments. Basically everything except exams is free points, nothing to worry about there. However, the exams are next level difficulty. Extremely stressful and difficult, and only real way to study is by taking previous exams. While the assignments test your applications of the concepts, the exams test your fundamental understanding of the concepts (which we never really practice in class, kind of just \"if you get it, you get it\" sort of thing). Chernov is a good lecturer, very deadpan but extremely funny and just an iconic guy. Can overcomplicate simple things at times, and a little unapproachable and unhelpful.

He's also a great lecturer and could explain the material pretty well (although he overcomplicated the explanations for the material after midterm 2), and even took the time to introduce us to higher level math like topology and lie algebra (although it flew over our heads). However, the class is a lot of work. There isn't much work per se- it's just webworks and homework sets, with an exam. But I spent a lot of time on those assignments (around 3-4h for each one), and even more time trying to understand the material. I came from a BC Calc background and even people who'd done Multivariable in high school were struggling. I think the class is worth while, as I learned a lot, but I don't know if the workload would've been manageable if I'd taken other hard classes like HUM1, BIO19, PHYS15, or CHEM11.

Also, he is very responsive to people in the class.

Math 011 is mostly about learning techniques and applying them without any creativity involved, but I feel as if the class did not learn that as well with Pauls. After about 2 or 3 classes with him, I basically didn't attend Math 011 until the final few lectures - but even then, I had switched over to Williams' section instead. As long as you read the textbook, do the WebWork exercises, attend the professor's office hours and TA sessions when needed, and review a little bit the night before an exam, then you're good to go. Going to class is not necessary, since Pauls may serve to confuse you more than he's trying to teach you. For all of you AIME/USAMO enthusiasts out there (though, they are only few and far in between at Dartmouth): This math class was a complete bore, and I wouldn't waste your time with it. It didn't teach me to think critically about problem solving, since most of the problems were a joke - as long as you applied the techniques you've learned VERBATIM. And even then, sometimes it's quicker to go the other way - like with some of the Optimization problems with Double Integrals, you probably could have just owned that stuff with the basic AM-GM inequality.\"",
            "review 12: \"07F with Scott Pauls: The course is more difficult than I expected. Having always understood math, this was a challenge for me and the topics are very abstract at times. However, with the book and TA's, the class is definitely manageable, especially with a good theory based perspective in math from high school. Professor Pauls is very knowledgeable about the course material. However, he often over-complicates concepts and it is often more useful to read the book. Further, Professor Pauls often delves more into the theory side of math and its applications to ideas from the course. This is contradicted by much easier problems in the webwork. Finally, the webwork is often either much easier or much more difficult than the course material, so beware. In all, if you are interested in taking math and would like the next step in calculus, I would recommend this class, but I would check the reviews of other professors, as I think they taught more to the actual application of problems rather than the theory behind them.\"",

            "review 1: \"08F with Marcia Groszek: If you are still deciding whether to take this course, here are some things to consider: + The course is heavy on memorization. No equation sheets. + You WILL have to be able to use obscure integration techniques... frequently. + There are two assignments for each class: a WeBWorK assignment, which is completely internet-based, and a written problem from the textbook which involves writing out solutions in clear English. + Essentially everybody in this class took AP Calculus BC in high school and did well. + Math 11 covers the material from the third or so of Math 8 AND all of the material from Math 13. This makes for a course that is even more fast-paced than the average Dartmouth course. + If at all possible, avoid taking other tough classes at the same time as Math 11. Only take Math 11 if you can give it the attention it deserves. If you can't, consider sacrificing an AP credit or two and take Math 3 or 8. Note: As negative as my comments may sound, I did have some moments of joy during Math 11. Don't let me discourage you from taking the course. I did poorly, but it isn't at all impossible to do well if you avoid the mistakes I made. Diligence and devotion are key: + Go to Collis, 3rd floor, and sign up for a tutor from the Academic Skills Center. Do this early in the term before they run out of tutors. Tutors are free if you're on any financial aid or a varsity athlete and $9/hr if you aren't. Tutors are a GREAT RESOURCE and even if you don't think you need one at the beginning of the class, you'll be glad you have one once the material starts getting harder. And yes, the material gets MUCH MORE DIFFICULT as time goes on, especially after the 2nd midterm. + Go to tutorials. Tutorials for us were held the evening before each class and were a nearly PAINLESS and EFFICIENT way to get WeBWorK and written homework done. + Go to office hours. Use and abuse them. Ask the questions you were too embarrassed to ask during class. + Go to class well-rested if you want to get anything out of lecture. Professor Groszek is good at teaching, but her voice has a tendency to induce sleep. + Study amply for exams. I didn't learn to do this until it was too late. As I mentioned before, the material gets MUCH harder with time. If I had to graph difficulty vs. time, it would resemble the graph of f(x)=x^3-- starts off easy, then settles at a level of mid-hard, then gets insanely difficult at the end, so be prepared. Again, I made some mistakes, and I did poorly. You don't have to! Random tidbit: When you start having to do integrals, revisit and MASTER both u-substitution (u-sub) and integration by parts (IBP), as both of these semi-obscure integration techniques will appear OFTEN. I was caught off-guard because I expected the course to focus on new material rather than the old AP Calculus BC material. My bad assumption cost me. About the reviewer: Hopefully from this information you'll be able to get a sense of whether Math 11 will be harder or easier for you than it was for me. I took AP Calculus BC during my senior year of high school... got low A's both semesters and a 5 on the exam.

First, if you are a math genius who never has to study and always aces tests and understands math without any effort, then this review is not for you. In high school, math was always my favorite subject. Calc BC was tricky, but I had a great teacher and did well on the AP. I came to Dartmouth planning on majoring in math, so taking math 11 was necessary. (I am no longer positive on what I'm going to major in...). But I am the kind of student who always got good grades by doing all my work and studying extremely hard for tests. That wasn't enough for math 11. The course is paced extremely quickly. I found myself having the read and outline the section in the textbook before class just to sort of understand what was going on. I would say that 95% of the time I would leave class completely confused as to what was going on. There is also a lot of outside work. There is written work due at every class as well as WebWork (online work). On top of that, every Monday we had a quiz. There were 2 midterms, both 2 hours long, and paced very quickly. The final was 3 hours, but there was more material. The final was also cumulative, and it was very hard having to go back and relearn the information from the first week of classes. I have never been so upset about a class. I would study 20 hours over 2 days and sometimes more to prepare for midterms, and still managed to do horribly. I never had the problem that my best simply wasn't good enough. It was the hardest thing to do in my freshman fall. Preparing for the final, all I thought about was what if I didn't pass the course. I would have gone through 10 weeks of hell for nothing. Somehow, I did manage to pass, and I did much better than I thought I would. If you were to ask me during the course if I would take it again, I would have given you a definite no! It was the most stress I have ever been through. But looking back, I did learn a lot and I feel really good about surviving math 11. My original plan to be a math major still isn't where it was when I came to Dartmouth... maybe I'll minor instead. But even though that was the toughest, most painful 10 weeks of my life, it feels so good to be done and to have done relatively well, at least better than I planned. So should you take it? If you don't plan on ever needing to know math in your future, then no. But if you have plans to continue with math or engineering or something along those lines, don't give up just because it's a really tough course. But if you are going to be an English major or something and want to take because it seems interesting, then you've been warned. If you want to read more (I don't blame you if you dont), then you can continue reading about Professor Groszek. She was a really great professor who wanted us to do well. I would go to her office hours often, and days when I couldn't make her scheduled hours she would rearrange her times so I could make it.

I'm not those type of math geniuses who can derive proofs or pick up material like a sponge. I need to study very very hard to do well. I'm not sure why I took this course--I don't plan to major/minor in math or do anything in the engineering track. I guess I just wanted to take a math course...just because. Well, I was in for a huge surprise. This course requires A LOT OF WORK, and a lot of time, and a lot of patience, and a lot of determination. (If you're a crazy math genius or USAMO qualifier, just ignore this review) And as other reviewers wrote, after the 2nd midterm, the material gets harder precipitously. My brain throbbed from studying for hours and hours on end. I started to even neglect some of my other classes because I didn't want to flunk math. Thank goodness this isn't Cornell, or I would've gladly liked to jump off into a gorge. That being said, I don't regret taking this course. I learned a lot, and even though at times I felt really stupid, I feel smarter now. But of course, if I were writing this review the night before the math final, I would've said \"I HATE MATH. I WANT TO DIE. SHOOT ME.\" But on a lighter note, Professor Groszek is the sweetest person you'll ever meet. She's so nice, and she's also a math genius. I'm really glad I had her. I guess the only thing I'd have to complain about is that she's a little *too* smart for me in class. She'll start explaining concept and theory, and waving her arms to make us visualize stuff--and I just don't get that. After I finished my final, I didn't *just* feel relieved because it was over. I felt accomplished--and that's something I never felt in high school. So this is a tough choice to make--would I do it again? Hm, probably. But I'd make sure I'm taking two lighter classes.\""

In fact, tons of kids dropped the course after the first exam, so if you plan on sticking it out after that exam, be forewarned that the median goes from about a 50 to around a 90.

The homeworks online can get annoying when you do 20 min. of work and miss the answer and get no credit for it unless you fix EVERYTHING you just did.

            "review 4: \"21F with Daniel Van Wyk: I was a massive fan of this class as a whole. I took it with Van Wyk, and he was magnificent. To start off, he is one of the funniest professors/teachers I had, using daily memes and jokes to keep the class lighthearted. But when it comes to mathematics, he is knowledgeable, accessible, and helpful. In class, he will spend as much time as necessary going over a student's question to ensure he/she understands the material, a rare sight in a class as large as this one. Although I never went to his office hours myself, I know second-hand that he was super helpful and willing to stay as long as necessary to help the students. The only less-than-positive comment I would make is to remark on his proneness to quick mistakes when writing on the board; he occasionally writes the wrong number or symbol during a lecture, which can confuse students and be tricky to catch. In terms of the difficulty of Math 11, I've heard various reviews, but coming from some (though very little) previous exposure to multivariable, I thought it was pretty manageable. It's certainly not a layup, but I senior year I had a loose introduction to vectors and partial derivatives, this previous exposure made the first couple weeks of the material much easier to relearn and digest, which was essential given the oft-mentioned pace of the class. Other comments: perhaps because the course includes so many students, it is very organized and well-run, from the homework to the grading. Every homework assignment is consistent--a webwork after every class and weekly written homeworks--and the midterms are usually graded and posted to your Canvas no more than a few hours after they finish. In summary, don't hesitate to take this class if you have previous exposure to multivariable (and even if you don't), and Van Wyk is a fantastic option.\"",

No intention of being a math major or a STEM major really, but I really enjoyed calculus and wanted to challenge myself\u2014in other words, my ego got to me. By week 2, I was doubting all my life choices. I needed a good hour after the lecture just to process the foreign language I'd straight copied from the board, and I got so frustrated with webworks that they ruined my whole afternoon. But trust me, nothing beats the serotonin of seeing the bright green column of \"correct\"s and the \"Perfect\" with 2 stars. The satisfaction of the puzzle pieces all coming together. I'd still strangely look forward to doing psets, especially once I found people to do them with. Van Wyk was a great professor: logical flow of lectures, great memes, individual attention to students, and just understanding and kind at heart. One time he continued helping me for a whole 20 minutes after class\u2014moving to the hallway as the next class was coming in\u2014because of one concept I just could not grasp. I didn't find the TAs to be as helpful, but still tried to attend the tutorials. Some advice: Skim the textbook sections before class, and reread them more thoroughly after class. I often found the first read too confusing to actually be useful, so solidifying the concepts afterward definitely helped. Always do all the practice problems given in class. Have your phone ready for pictures and complete them later if you can't finish. Take notes on your webworks and written homework. To help myself learn, I'd write down step-by-steps for a certain type of problem. Whenever you make a mistake, write it down and draw spiky circles all over it. Do the supplementary textbook problems before tests, along with the practice tests and TA practice problems. Even if you feel like you're getting everything wrong or you can't do anything without looking at the answer key (definitely me), it's still working. You'll know better for later. Finally, create a study (support) group. I met some of my closest friends here :) At the end of everything, I still have no intention of being a math major or a STEM major. But I'm going to go against the grain here and say that, hell, even if you don't have to take this course and you just like math, take a chance with math 11, especially with Van Wyk!

The written homework is a little bit tougher, but never felt too unfair, and the grading on it got less harsh as the term progressed. The exams were pretty straightforward. The two midterms were quite doable and had very few trick questions - if you understood the content, you would do well. The final, being cumulative, was a lot tougher than the other two exams, but at very least everyone was in the same boat. The only main thing this class struggles with is pacing. We dedicated the last 6 weeks to what Math 13 covers in all 10 weeks. This would have been fine if we spent a little more time on the challenging concepts (with examples) and less time on some of the more straightforward ones. It's hard to get that exactly right (especially since everyone comes from different familiarities with multivariable calculus - I had zero coming into this and it had been a year since I did Calc BC, and luckily I still did pretty well), but it is absolutely essential if you're cramming this much material into this little of a timeframe.

That afternoon, he sent me all the notes from that class (handwritten) and was making sure I was okay the next class. John Voight is the sweetest person ever. Contentwise, the course is really fast-paced as the name \"accelerated multivariable calculus\" suggests. I did multivariable calculus in my junior year in high school and I forgot everything. This course was good at first since we cover some basic, fundamental things quickly, but as the pace adds up at the end, it is hard to understand. I have seen some kids literally studying by themselves at the end of the term since they could not fully understand the content in class. Two midterms and one final - midterms are not that hard. They have around 85% median. But the final exam was hard af. They were 3 hours long and challenging. Some of my friends who are really good at math even said the final was hard. Again, this course is really challenging. After taking the course, now I feel like I should have taken math 13 instead.

That's fine, but sometimes I found myself forgetting what a theorem actually meant, let along how I should apply it to a question. The homework was fine, unless you do all the supplementary problems in the book. I did none of them, just the online work, and studied an average amount and ran a B+, which was just about average.

The hardest part of this class is not the math itself (in fact I'd say the content is easy/manageable) but how fast the course moves, so you absolutely need to always be on top of things because once you fall behind there is no going back.\"",

            "review 1: \"23F with Michael Montgomery: Math 11 is a very rigorous, fast-paced course. Many if not most of the students enrolled took multivariable in high school (or dual enrolled in a college), and the course is much harder for people who haven't taken it before (think- curves). Lots of kids who did AP BC calc opt for math 9 instead, it's much easier and slower and you can definitely get an A with a BC background. Math 11 is much harder, although an A- is not impossible with only BC background. I poured everything into the final exam and managed to scrape by. Many engineering students or other older students remember Math 11 as one of (if not THE) hardest courses they took. So be wary. That being said, although the course itself was difficult and fast-paced, I thought Professor Montgomery was great. Going in I was nervous since his Layuplist reviews were rather harsh, but he actually was a very good prof in my opinion. He explains topics very clearly and thoroughly, spending a lot of time on proofs. He provides practice problems in class. It was definitely necessary to preview the chapter lessons before going to lecture, but as long as I had done so, I found it pretty straightforward to follow along. He frequently stops to ask for questions and check in, and reexplains concepts with patience when needed. Most important, Montgomery's office hours were excellent. I went to almost everyone, and he spent hours each week personally explaining problems and helping us through different concepts and lessons. He was really approachable, friendly, and seemed to actively try and lesson our stress- giving helpful tips on exam studying and HW problems and approaching the grading policies very matter-of-factly. He was a down to earth guy who was obviously really passionate about math and his students. I liked talking to him and was excited by the material, even though the course itself was too fast imo and hard. His enthusiasm was funny and contagious. I think most of the negative reviews on this site and etc for him are mainly coming from students unhappy with their grades and/or the course itself. But remember to take all reviews with a grain of salt- each person benefits from different teaching styles. I wouldn't recommend Math 11 for freshman fall unless you have a multivar background, you are a very strong math/science student, you are willing to sacrifice social time/other subjects to get an A- or A, or you don't care about a B- grade. But I would recommend Prof Montgomery!\"",
            "review 2: \"22F with Michael Montgomery: If you take this class please give yourself the breathing room to have time to self study. Taking two other hard courses ate up my time and cramming did not end up being easy or efficient for this course. That being said, Professor Montgomery's class in particular was rather unmemorable. I started realizing that the class felt like it was straight out of the textbook. The class had been behind, and after skipping lectures for an entire week and just reading the textbook for a few hours I was already caught up further than the lectures were when I came back. Genuinely no disrespect to Professor Montgomery, but his teaching feels quite literally \"straight out of the text book\", and he hasn't the best ways of explaining things in digestible manners for students. This may change with time, but from my observations this term, it became very clear when a topic flew over most of the classes heads. Also, do not stress too much over the written homework. Start it 1 day earlier than you think you need to. If you think you can get it done the night before its due, start it two days ahead. It is not worth panicking to turn it in by 4 pm when it's worth 5% of your grade. If you've put a lot of work into it but can't get an answer for a problem you still could get 2/3 points so just do your best and move on, cause your time is better spent on literally anything else (which is annoying because its one of the most time consuming parts of the course work). The Webworks are alright, often I actually learned a topic by just trying to tackle the webworks after zoning out in class. Also screw mid terms. 4:30-6:30 is the most mind numbing thing ever. Especially on bonfire night. Overall if you really wanna know the content its gonna be mostly on your end to teach yourself with lectures being hit or miss. This course is accelerated, but that also means it has even more potential to leave out content, so if you want to go further with subjects that use multivariable, I'd brush up on your own time to cover the gaps that will inevitably occur given the pace of this course. I still didn't hate the class, but I could go either way on recommending this course or not. Pick your poison, just be ready to direct your own learning. (P.S. My experience before this was Calc AB and self-studied Calc BC, so I wouldn't let a lack of experience with multi be the limiting factor if you have placement.)\"",

My school didnt offer multi, but I was hoping because I got a 5 on the AP I'd be fine. I was so wrong. The class is impossible without prior knowledge/hours and hours every day to devote to the material. I took this class with another hard class and physically didnt have enough hours in the day to study enough to get a good grade, that's how difficult the material is. Montgomery is super nice, but not a very effective teacher, and my understanding improved significantly when I stopped paying attention to his lectures and started teaching myself from the textbook, which was fine but it added even more time that I had to devote this class outside of the given classtime. Unless you did well in multi in highschool, I'd recommend just taking 8 +13, or whatever the two course sequence is. If you decide to take this class, you have to make sure your other two classes are layups.\"",

However, the average student in this class already did multivariable calculus in high school and is thus familiar with the content. The ceiling of this class is kids who went to AMO and IMO. So if you're like me, expect to be on the bottom score-wise. If you're wondering, with the average student learning multivariable calculus, the median exam score is still around 65. Yeah. That low. I walked out of the final with almost everyone saying it was the hardest exam they'd ever taken, and that's not wrong. I did Physics 15 in the same term and even though P15 was supposed to be a little harder than this, I found P15 a lot more of a positive experience than this class. The essential crime of this class isn't that it is not well taught. Michael was a great professor who walked through examples slowly and made sure everyone understood the concept for the class. After I missed a few classes due to sickness he spent entire hours giving me the whole lecture again during office hours and is genuinely a great human being. The crime of this class is that it only has time to teach you properly all the concepts and how to use them to solve questions directly related to the concept, and then on the exam throws you curveballs that are so out of reach that you won't even understand what some of these questions are asking. The exam will destroy you as the questions are just plain too difficult. The course is curved at the end so the grade you receive would not be terrible on the transcript, but it nonetheless will certainly kill your interest in mathematics needlessly. Don't take this class if you have a choice to take a different class. It's truly horribly designed. As a weed-out class, it fails to serve its purpose as people in this class are certainly smart enough to succeed in higher-level classes, but in effect it intimidates those that are qualified to a trajectory away from mathematics.\"",

I really enjoyed math and I did well in BC so I figured this would be a good, challenging class. No. This class did nothing but discourage me. A total mistake to take freshman fall. I had to put in so much work outside of class to just understand a fraction of what was being taught. The lectures were poorly structured and we only ever went over the easiest kinds of problems that would never show up on an exam anyway. If you have never touched multivariable before, this is probably not to best class to start. 10 weeks is far too short to learn so much content (sometimes the prof would just not answer questions because we were on too much of a time crunch to stop and understand what he was saying).

He has a unique sense of humor that makes the class very engaging, and he gets to the root of the material and shows us how everything is derived and how to prove it. This class is generally made out to be much harder than I experienced it to be. Most people taking this class are freshmen who've taken AP calculus BC. The material goes over vectors, vector calculus, multivariable multivariable functions, and double and triple integrals. It honestly isn't too hard to gain some kind of intuition as to what's going on, as long as you understood AP calc pretty well. If you're good with visualizing three dimensional graphs, performing calculus in three dimensions is just another step in extending AP calc. Work: Weekly written problem set that consisted of two to four problems, easily doable the day before; daily (daily in the sense of each day the class met) online homework on WebWork, which also didn't take too long, probably took 45 minutes roughly for me.

Before you take this class freshman fall, I'd definitely consider taking two terms to do the same thing with the math 9-math 13 route as that will allow you to actually get a handle on the material, especially if you need it for further classes--I came out of this class not really confident that I could know what to do if I were to see the material again in later classes, math or physics or otherwise. BC calc is also not a great thermometer for this class.

The course is very challenging and has a medium workload. There are daily Webworks consisting of 5-10 problems as well as weekly problem sets, and it can often feel like the material covered during class and by the reading is not quite what is asked by them. I am emerging from this Fall not feeling very confident in most the material covered and do not intend to go further in math at Dartmouth. Even if this is required for your major, I would still consider the Math 9/13 route as a viable and potentially better option. However, if math is your thing, go ahead and enroll.

I actually really liked how fast class was taught, but it definitely picks up in the last few weeks of the course (one theorem a day).

He also approaches the content in a theoretical way, which to someone like me who came from an underfunded public school was something I never experienced. I believe I would have preferred if he expected us to cover the content on our own time and spent the class time going over what types of problems we might encounter, as I went into both midterms and final wondering what kind of questions I was even going to see. Overall, the ORC describes it best but misses a key detail: you should take this class if you got a 5 on BC AND have had some past experience with calc 3.

When my prof went to England for a math conference, two of the other Math 11 professors subbed my class, and I still viewed my professor quite favorably. He does make some errors while he writes on the blackboard, but as long as a person that took multivariable calculus in high school points out the error, the class proceeds rather smoothly. Course As the name implies, this \"accelerated\" course is quite fast-paced and requires significant commitment. Reading the textbook before class helped a lot, even though I was skeptical of its effect before I started doing it. Attempt the supplementary problems as additional practice; only doing what is required may jeopardize your chance of succeeding in the class. People that have taken multivariable calculus in high school find this class much easier, and the tests do not ask you to apply crazy things. Because three of the four professors are new this year, the trends of the class may not stand true.

The course material was very straight forward, and Erik always gave us test problems that were basically the same as our homework/ the textbook. We'd usually get one problem set a week that took a few hours.

We never used calculators or statistical programming so numbers and problems were relatively simple. Erik's lectures were really clear and well organized, so you always understood what's happening. As other reviewers have noted, the midterms were ten multiple choice questions without particle credit and the final was 20 points. So even though the questions were relatively easy, you had to be extra careful because one or two small mistakes could tank your grade.

Two written projects were assigned over the course of the term, but both were actually interesting and everybody got a 100 anyway. The only hangup on this course is that midterms were 10 multiple choice questions and the final was 20 multiple choice, so these tests were very high-stakes.

That said, I think the class itself just somehow happened to be composed of remedial kids. Some students would ask ridiculous stupid questions that either had nothing to do with the class, or were so basic that it's astounding. Professor Leibon, a very nice man, takes these extremely retarded questions quite seriously, hence he dwells on tangents for an excessive amount of time, and even delves deep into them, creating more confusion among the already unintelligent crowd. Statistics is not simple to do; however, going back and forth between computer software notations and the books notations made it worse. In addition, the course goes extremely fast during the second half, creating massive chaos because we didn't learn the first half of the ideas as well as the professor thinks we did. I am willing to bet a nickel that there are at least 5 to 10 kids in that class that will complete the course and still not know the most basic of the materials taught. It was a terrible experience, but I blame it on the students of the class as much as I do the professor (who has left-handed-cursive writing which is really hard to read).

There was also the day that he turned a 3D mountain into a horse. His usage of colored chalk is inspiring. The class itself was pretty hard. Maybe because I probably should have taken Math 8 instead of 9, even though I really like math. The book assignments were difficult and confusing sometimes, and one problem could take several hours, even if you had 3 or more people trying to do it. The webwork problems weren't as bad. They were a lot closer to the material that we were taught in class. The exams were difficult. You really have to study ahead of time and practice doing strange problems, because most of the problems are highly conceptual. A few of the problems on the final came from nowhere, I swear. The curve is slightly helpful, but the tests still feel like rapings if you don't study enough. If you're really a math whiz, you'll love this class.

I would also like to think I got more out because I pushed myself. It was great to have Dumitrascu as a teacher. His lectures were informative and organized, and he has absolutely the most wonderful sense of humor. He also seemed very willing to talk to students after or outside of class. However, he kept getting behind in his lectures, which was much more of a problem than in a normal class since there were four sections. Thus, we were not able to begin our web homework for each topic until 2 or 3 days have the other classes could. One difference between this class and Math 8 was the written bookwork, which was difficult, time-consuming, and graded very toughly.

It was not, to my knowledge, \"more theoretical\" than Math 8 and did not seem to cover more depth of the concepts. I certainly learned a lot of math in a short period of time but I felt it was a the cost of knowing where the theories come from and how the formulas are derived.

Math 9 actually moved slower than Math 8, and some think they learned the material better than we did. However, even that pace was too fast. We covered several new topics every class period at the beginning of the term, which made the first midterm very difficult. Also difficult about the exams is that there are only 8 or 9 long problems worth 10-15 points each, meaning each one is a huge percentage of the grade. You can earn partial credit, thankfully, but that didn't make up for the test material. Instead of testing on the material covered in class, there were multiple questions testing our ability to think abstractly, which I didn't feel was fair to those of us in the class who had studied the material given and didn't have the capacity for those extrapolations. I did feel like I learned things in the class, but the pace was definitely a little fast for my liking. The class gets easier after the first exam, so just hang in there if you take it. Professor Dumitrascu is Romanian, so he has a bit of trouble with English...his heavy accent takes a little bit to adapt to, and sometimes his grammar is garbled, but in all it's a very good source of entertainment. He's a very funny, nice man, and he's very willing to help you in and out of class. Extremely accessible.

That is not to say the exams were easy. They were generally pretty well-leveled. All of the homeworks involved proofs even though proofs were rare on the exams. The professor did not really explain the material at all. His lectures involved copying long and uninteresting proofs on the board from advanced textbooks, which were way beyond the scope of our textbook. Prof Skandera did seem interested in the students and how they were doing to some degree. He encouraged students to ask questions in class, although none really did. Perhaps the effort was there, but the outcome was not on Prof Skandera's part.

To that aspect, it was successful in deterring me from pursuing further classes in it. But other than that, I honestly don't think the class is worth it unless you're interested and motivated in the subject. When choosing Math 8/9, the two things I'd base my choice on would be the prof's and the tests. I chose Skandera because of the prof's offered this term, he seemed to be the best. In terms of workload, Math 9's mandate of writing your homework in proof form did take up a lot of unnecessary time usually, although it did help when studying to read over detailed proofs explaining everything. The prof's would almost always assign the harder problems, so in addition to grasping the concepts, we then had to apply them in often the most difficult cases, similar to learning to add and then having to add fractions for homework. In terms of tests, they're pretty long, and pretty tricky. The final was definitely a killer - it took the whole three hours, and it was very difficult, even though I had done very well on the previous tests. The projects, meant for \"enrichment,\" I guess, were like group homework assignments that often required you to visit the TA to get a good portion of it, and then spending a lot of time by yourselves on it. The best part about doing the groups was meeting up and befriending other people in the class so that we could help each other out. The course material seemed to be a bit harder to grasp and at a faster pace in the beginning of the term, but eased up towards the second half. None of it was really too interesting, which makes me wonder why I took this class in the first place instead taking a much more interesting one. Oh, for all you science people who have to take Math 8/9 as a prereq., then just keep up the work. Also, it really helps to (get to) know some people in the class so that you can work together.

To boil it down, this class is the same as MATH8, except instead of spending a few weeks on taylor polynomials (which was covered in BC), you supplement the material with an intro to linear algebra. The linear algebra we learn in class, which at times can be decently confusing, does definitely help give a geometric framework for the multivariable calc concepts we learn. Dr. Lin grew on me over the term, but at first his lectures felt very dry. He's a great guy, he honestly just needs a week or two to really open up. The tests are fair; the exam problems are mostly variants of the types of questions we cover in the lectures and in homework, usually with an application-based question thrown in there that requires you to synthesize a few concepts. A few students got pretty heavily penalized on the second exam because they used a method for solving a problem that we hadn't covered in class yet, which is a little ridiculous, but other than that I haven't really heard any complaints.

I will say, reading the textbook and taking notes off of that helps immensely. Given how they move to a new topic every class and don't dwell on some of the information for too long, it can be easy to forget things or get overwhelmed and fall behind. I will say the information is pretty well taught by Schembri and if you use your resources, you can pass the class. Again, I highly recommend the textbook, both are super easy to follow, give you all the information you need, and allow you to take your time and really understand the material in a way that a lecture couldn't. Additionally, with the midterms being 24 hours and having a week for the homework, you have a nice amount of time to do the assignments which is a plus to the online format. However, the homework and midterms will often have a couple questions that feel like you have no idea how to answer it and seem so beyond the material so that is hard to overcome and you have to spend a lot of time working out how to solve it without knowing if you're right. That part is a little frustrating, but not enough to avoid this class or call it bad by any means. The only problem I would say is Professor Kamran and Schembri split the lecture videos and the ones Professor Kamran does are often difficult to understand and challenging to follow. He doesn't really explain the material and jumps from thing to thing without connecting them or really going into a depth that would help you. For these lectures, it's probably best to just use the textbooks or Khan Academy. Personally, I would say I'm above average in math, and I got a 98 on the first midterm, maybe like an B+ on the second midterm (the grade still isn't out yet), and never below an A on the homework. Also I didn't take math BC like probably a lot of other kids in my class.

Some advice: 1) Plan to scan through your webwork (online HW) before the TA sessions start at night and use those sessions to answer any HW questions you have or get tricks on how to do some of the problems they didn't show you how to do in class. Many of the hw problems and most of the problem set problems you don't learn how to do in class during that first third; so you have to be able to turn to a classmate (not as helpful or encouraging of good study habits) or a TA or use office hours to get help through the hw. 2) Sign up for a study group (the type you have to pay for) on a sunday or monday and get the weekly problem set done before that. Our problem sets were usually due on wednesday. Getting the problem set mostly done and coming do the study group with questions for the TA was a fool proof way to get an A on each problem set and understand the material. Best $40 i've ever spent. 3) You may find the first problem set or two easy but the difficulty on the ones following that picks up exponentially, so don't leave that problem set to the last minute.

In fact, Prof. Pauls didn't go over most of the techniques needed to complete the homework, so I found myself having to self-teach the material. WebWork (the homework program) was a ridiculous waste of time, and all math students who have to deal with it will probably agree that resorting to random guessing was a common occurrence. On average, an eight-problem set would take me between three and four hours, which I believe is way too much time to be spending on such a small number of problems. Professor Pauls was by far one of the worst professors I have had (or hope to have) and killed any desire I had to continue in mathematics.

Beware that not all Math 8 classes cover the same material, although exams and homework do. Pauls covers what you need to know, and will tell you, \"This theorem may be interesting to me, but I know it's not to you.

That being said, I wasn't a \"perfect student\" in Mainkar's Math 8 class. I attended every class, worked hard on the homework, but did not attend office hours. Namely, because I was completing the homework (often deceptively easy) and had no real concerns. I did not purchase the Math textbook at the behest of an upperclassman, who told me that he did fine without it, as assignments are posted online and if you \"get it\" you don't need the book anyways. I ended up studying with a friend who had, post-1st-midterm for reasons listed below. I soon discovered, post 1st midterm, that the exams did not cover questions of similar calibre to the homework. This, combined with Mainkar's ineffective lectures that presented information in precise mathematical terms, with poor/non-existent explanation, made the entire course rather boring and frustrating, coming from a kid who's always had an easy time with math. So it's really not all Mainkar's fault; I learned my lessons quickly, began studying with a friend who had the book, and worked rather hard for the second half of the course to pull off a B. However, this does not change the fact that I have a few gripes with the class. They are: 1. The homework material has little correlation to exams. 2. The lectures are boring and poorly done, which is not helped by Mainkar's accent in some cases (though not a terribly big deal). 3. The class takes its time in some places that I felt were rather easy, and sped through certain sections with insufficient explanation.

Pauls is somewhat dry and just sprays his stream of conciousness - he doesn't seem too concerned that his students get the concepts while in class. As the term winds on, people will only be saying good things about Shemanske, but the opinions on Pauls and Gilbert will be mixed - I guarantee it. As for the subject: Calculus is a beautiful art form underlying the observable universe. Math 3-13 elucidate this brilliance, although they do so rather impersonally. I wish that there was more time spent on historical problems, mathematicians, and consequences of calculus, but damned be the D-plan.

I can't imagine him teaching a course completely on his own though, so if he does in the future I would steer clear.

The fact that it follows the text makes it a lot easier to learn the material. Do NOT leave everything to the week before the exams, however! Attempt ALL the webwork problems and DO take a look at the bookwork problems. If you have questions, go to the tutorials or office hours if your friends can't help you. The exams aren't that bad and seem to focus on things that weren't necessarily emphasized above everything else, so study all the material and be prepared by DOING PRACTICE PROBLEMS. There aren't any killer surprises on the exams, but know that even though they say there's a lot of partial credit, you may find that you make most of your algebra mistakes on the 3 or 5 point non-partial credit questions ... and those add up! There's definitely a nice curve though. Anyway, kind of boring lectures, but Williams tries to interact with the students a lot more than other profs. The class just doesn't respond some of the time.

While I understand why it has to be so fast paced, Zili would literally just throw random equations on the board and then expect us to understand what we're doing. This was absolutely the worst math class I have ever taken, and I'm not even being dramatic about it. I thought there was a lot of homework assigned as well, and most of it is so difficult since you learn such simple concepts during class time that you're basically teaching yourself while doing the homework. In my opinion, copying down theorems and formulas from the textbook was equivalent to - if not more useful than - sitting in that miserable classroom for 65 minutes. Zili would \"ask\" us if we had questions but barely give us time to raise our hands to ask them, and when she did actually call on students, she would answer a completely different question that ended up making us more confused. I felt completely unprepared for the two midterms and final. Additionally, the way the Gradescope (written) homeworks were graded was completely random and unfair. Since we were able to collaborate on them, I would do it with a friend and we would turn in the same exact worse. However, not once would we receive the same grade on the homework which makes zero sense if we turned in the same thing. It's not even like my professor was just poor and the others were good; from what I heard from students in different sections, none of the professors seemed to be proficient in teaching Math 8. While Zili seems like a nice person, she was not a good professor at all, and I would advise everyone to stay away from the course, especially if she is teaching it. I took BC Calc in high school, so some of the topics overlapped, yet I found myself to be more confused and unknowledgeable on the subject than when I began Math 8. 0/10, do NOT recommend.\"",

So in terms of learning the material it was pretty typical. Grading was definitely a bit rougher - if you don't define exactly what you're doing at each step of a written homework or exam problem, you're getting points off. I guess they're trying to force students to use mathematical reasoning, but it did get a bit annoying after a while. That being said the exams were of a reasonable difficulty - maybe a little easier (sometimes much easier) than the homeworks. Then again some of the homework problems were quite wicked.

The first unit was very difficult but in the second and third class was easy to understand and follow along. She was good at explaining topics. The written work was the most difficult part of the class and was very time consuming. It required the topics to be thought of in a completely different way that I would not have been able to do without a TA or professor's help. That being said there were many opportunities for you to get help. I wouldn't tell people not to take this class but be prepared that it won't be easy.

            "review 12: \"04F with Marcia Groszek: Don't be fooled by the reviews of past years like I was. Choose another seminar while you still have the chance! Not convinced? The class should be entitled: Intro to set theory, which the prof. happens to be an expert on. You spend half of the class debating readings that noone really has a grasp on, and the other half you sit and watch prof. Groszek write on the board with obscure notation (which every five min someone will ask about) and orally present the information. Here are a few of my class notes: (i'm summarizing, since i can't type half of them due to symbols): If not Dedekind infinite, then Dedekind finite: Proposition 1: A is Dedekind infinite if and only if A has an infinite countable subset. Proposition 2: A is Dedekind infinite if A is infinite. Proposition 3: (needs the Axiom of Choice) Axiom of Choice: If B is any collection (set) of sets, there is a choice function c for b A is infinite if A is Dedekind infinite ......... Are you even still reading this? At least those notes were in english. Basically she just keeps repeating 'the set of all sets is not equal to the set of the set of the set of all real numbers\" in an infinite number of ways. Another warning: Math writing DOES NOT EQUAL normal writing. You may sense some bitterness in the above statement: it's true. I went into a seminar my freshman fall because supposedly I am 'proficient' at writing. Prof. Groszek has all together other comments to make. Math writing requires you to break every writing rule ever created, and then you will be punished. She forces you to use the verb 'to be' and then you are told you use too much passive. You must sat \"we\" and not \"one\". Don't try to vary sentence structure either, because you will be forced to remove all subordinate clauses, as they are considered superfluous. And most importantly, you will not be graded on what a writing specialist thinks of your paper, or the overall flow. You will be graded on specific grammar points or poor 'word choice', which (by the way) happens a lot if you aren't used to taking every word literally. I was told not to use the word \"shows\", because it indicates that we are mathematically proving something. Away from personal experience, we all wrote four papers. You turn in a rough draft on friday, get back a corrected copy on monday, and have the final copy due the next friday. Many others agreed with me that Prof. Groszek can't make up her mind on what she wants: You make all of the corrections she gives you and then some, and then somehow she is dissatisfied with the final product. She changes her mind frequently on what she wants. Therefore, unless you have an intense interest in the above (not really infinity as you would first think), find ANY other seminar. It's true you don't have to read much, but I would rather have spent twice the time I did on a seminar I even half enjoyed. This was a horrible waste of four thousand dollars.\"",

The discussions tend to bounce from topic to topic, some of which aren't really relevant, but if you have a topic you want to talk about that relates at all to infinity or philosophy, you can talk about it here. You have to write a total of 25 pages over 4 papers. This isn't too hard to do if you follow the guidelines for the papers. You turn in your paper as a rough draft, get it back a few days later with comments, and then have a chance to revise it before turning in the final draft.

Saw the reviews for Professor Kremer... and figured to give a shot. I'm glad I did. I knew the class was going to be different when she assigned our first assignment right out of the gate.... the first day. It was a short 1-2 page essay on why a published study on suntan addiction was flawed. She assigned the essay to gain an understanding on students' weaknesses and strengths in writing.

We did in class peer review (that doesn't really work... truthfully). But going over the essay sentence by sentence in a one on one session did. If you didn't finish.... or if you made corrections after the initial session (held on a Wednesday, the final draft being due the following Tuesday), you could bring her corrections... and go over the essay again. The second essay and book was on misleading drug advertising. The essay was on a specific drug. I did mine on Merck and Vioxx. I didn't do as well on the final draft... and she literally told me \"rewrite the essay to get it in the A range\"). So I did... I don't know what I got on the essay... but the point is that she wanted me to do well. The third and final essay was a 7-9 pager with a graph (just comparing data, very simple). It was on any public health crisis. And you could take it in any direction you wanted to.... truly any. One essay was on video game use to help with memory loss.... another on living wills... another on extra time and the SAT. We also had to do an oral presentation on it... some people were creative others were not. They were all interesting. For the final essay, she did not go over the essay word by word. I was extremely disappointed.... and felt abandoned. She said we were ready. I guess we were. All along, she was always inducing good writing habits (less passive voice... less wordiness... my main problems). Introducing experts from whom you quote. And along the way, we learned about healthcare... and how different people within the industry have misused or manipulated data. I feel like a better writer. And no the work isn't overbearing.

The Cons: You work in a group on the papers, which can be good or bad: by the end, I had figured out that you must find a partner who is as committed as you are. Also, working in small pairs beats larger groups (for me, at least). The other main issue is that Prof. Wallace is difficult to reach, over blitz or even at office hours. On more than one occasion she left office hours early, or just didn't show up. She did try to be accomodating and reschedule, but if you had a question it was often difficult to get it answered in time for the deadline (this is without procrastination, I'm talking about general questions that could have been answered via blitz).

I then took Math 8 anyway and found it to be so worthwhile that I will take Math 13 as an elective. The course description for Math 4 is inaccurate. It claims that we learn about \"matrix algebra and solution techniques for first order differential equations\". We never went over matrix algebra and we spent about 15 minutes reviewing solutions to very basic differential equations. We really didn't learn any new methods for solving math problems. We did, however, explore the creative side of math. We used differential equations to model the movement of drugs through the body, the ecosystem of Lake Victoria, and the lifecycle of malaria. We unfortunately could solve only a few of the equations. Instead we relied on a computer program called the Big Green Differential Equation machine, but I doubt that anyone in the class really understood how it worked. This was very frustrating. The class had three papers which consisted mostly of modeling. Two papers were written in groups. This could get very frustrating and time consuming because it's difficult to allocate responsibility for a math paper without sacrificing its coherence. There were no exams or graded homeworks (other than the papers), so the class was not very stressful. However, it was organized poorly. Its pace was painfully slow for the first 6 weeks, but we then ended up writing 2 VERY LONG papers in about 3 weeks at the end of the term. Professor Wallace is a nice lady, but a lousy teacher. Her lectures were almost useless and she inspired little to no interest in mathematical biology. You must attend EVERY lecture, however, because there are only 10-15 people in the class and grading is very subjective. The class does have a few positive points. If you're hunting for an A, the median grade in this class is usually A. The class is not too stressful or time-consuming, and you may be fortunate enough to have a wonderful TA like Bisserka Williams. Overall, I advise you to avoid taking this class unless you have no interest in calculus or you can't stand math tests (and believe me, the exams in Math 8 are not nearly as difficult as some people say they are).\"",

The main issue I had was that the phenomena we were studying were so complex, and the math we were using so crude, that the class seemed an excercise in futility. I learned very little. Professor Wallace isn't a great lecturer, but she tries really hard, and she's a very nice person.\""

Lahr makes ZERO effort in trying to make the course interesting and solves easy examples in a monotone (most likely the rest of the class is asleep) and then leaves you for the rest. Result, you will learn almost nothing from him. Having said that, most students who take this course most probably know most of the material from high school (go ahead and take Math 8!) and the curve will NOT be easy if you treat this as an INTRODUCTORY calculus course which it is unfortunately meant to be (I took it that way; got screwed). Near the end of the course I found myself relying increasingly on online sources to understand math, along with the tutors at the 3 times a week math tutorial. (I highly recommend justmathtutoring.com) Concluding, the class is a complete waste of time and effort and I might be doing an audit course of Math 3 in the winter just to learn the material again because this class did not teach me anything. If you can, AVOID LAHR. Although I suspect the quality of the other teachers won't be much better, they have to be more interesting and inspiring than Lahr and his droning monotone.

I recommend trying to get into Yang's class, or Pomerance's, because Lahr is the absolute worst prof you could have for this course. He speaks in a monotone, makes students feel stupid when they ask questions, doesn't explain concepts well, and gives easy examples in class that don't reflect the difficulty of problems on the homework or in exams. And something I feel must be mentioned, although awkward, is that Lahr's handwriting is illegible - meaning you have to listen very closely to his monotone in lectures, because you're not going to get anything from what he writes on the slides. His handwriting is so difficult to read because he is handicapped, but feeling bad for him isn't a reason to suffer through his lecture. However, you should go to class - despite the boringness - and take lots of notes. My advice: go to tutorial every time it is offered, and make friends with the tutors. And don't buy the textbook - it is a WASTE of money. Lahr wrote it (which is why he wants you to buy it) and it basically just restates his poor explanations in typed form, and sometimes serves to confuse you further.

The text was completely unhelpful and lectures left me in the same state of confusion before and after. The tutorials were more like a frusterating struggle to assert yourself and get help in somewhat of a timely manner while maintaining some sort of level of courtesy. Generally, i was extremely frusterated with the homework. Usually it was either something which was very simple that i had learned in high school (although those who had never taken calculus were completely in the dark) or some obscure guess and check problem which did not help me understand the material at all. Additionally, i felt that there was no real corrilation between the homework, on which we were required to use computer programs and calculators, and the exams, on which there was no use of the calculator whatsoever. I would NOT take this course unless you have to. Unfortunately, it is required for many courses and majors outside of the department. All i can say is, good luck!\"",

            "review 3: \"20F with Timmy Ma: This is a solid Professor who really cares about his students. For example, one time during X hour when he was showing us how Riemann's sum for the volume of a cylinder, he went through each student on the call and asked us if we understood what he had done so far. Every day before class, he answered our questions on webworks or on the quizzes. He is very quirky and it is funny, he is also a bit sassy too lol. In terms of structure, I liked the flipped classroom format, I think it fit well for a remote term. Before each class, we had to read the textbook, watch the recorded lectures, and attempt the webwork problems (which were due every Sunday night). I think Timmy Ma is one of the best Math 3 profs because he lays out the \"why\" behind theorems (i.e it has to be continuous and differentiable -- he will also show you have to satisfy these conditions if you ask). He would also further explain concepts the other Math 3 professors failed to explain or messed up in the recorded lectures. I def walked away from this class with an enhanced sense of critical thinking. In terms of testing, we had 2 midterms and a final (each 18%), the final was really hard but I have no idea what the medians were for any of these tests. The second midterm I liked, and the first one I think was pretty straightforward, I just made silly mistakes. The quizzes were also graded for completion not accuracy. However, he was very accommodating to any concerns I had with the midterms and even gave me a few points back ! However, I will say, sometimes he takes a while to respond to emails which can be annoying when you're struggling on a webwork. As a solution, I would go to TA office hours for webwork help and this helped me so so much. Definitely take advantage of this resource if you have the time ! We had unlimited attempts on webworks, (which were graded for completion -- 18% of grade) and group work was fair (also about 18% of the grade) -- keep your fingers crossed you get a good group !! Oh and we also had worksheets we did in breakout rooms with our groups, but sometimes it was like pulling teeth to get my group to talk -- I guess zoom format probably didn't help. Additionally, I don't like how the other Math 3 teachers grade specific problems on the midterms and final, I lost points a few times and I think it is because the grader didn't like my approach which is wack in my opinion.

Math 3 seems to be a poorly designed course no matter which professor you take it with, but Timmy Ma at times makes it way more painful than it already is. Starting out in the class, when you look at the grade distribution you'll probably think to yourself \"This will be an easy A.\" After all, the Webworks (worth 18%) have unlimited tries, which means you can keep going until you get 100% on all of them. The quizzes (5%) are graded based on completion, and the Surveys (5%) are relatively easy to fill out. The two midterms are each worth 18% of your grade and so is the final. Where you will really get screwed is the final. You might perform relatively well on the first two midterms, as they are testing you on relatively straightforward topics. There's no dicey stuff; what you learned is exactly what you apply. The problem comes about with the final. The final for this term was an absolute pile of horse dung, as evidenced by the fact that so many students got Cs. The issue comes about in the fact that the professors erred terribly in choosing when to actually pick our brains and teach us to apply simple Calculus concepts to more complex problems. They chose the final, which was the most horrible thing they could've done. There was not enough practice in the theoretical sort of thinking that they wanted us to put into the final. They will lure you into a false sense of security with the exams and the quizzes and the Webworks, which are all standard Math. But then on the final, your grade will be destroyed by a horrible grade because the final asks you difficult questions (and even one question that you never learned how to do that will be worth 12 points of your grade. I kid you not). That being said, if you have to take this class, you will have to push yourself and rely heavily on yourself and other resources. You will have to learn more than what they teach you, because they will demand more than what they have taught you at the end of the course. They will singlehandedly destroy your GPA or put you on Academic Warning if you don't watch your back and teach yourself the concepts thoroughly.

When asked a question, at times he ended talking about a completely irrelevant topic. It only took me a few weeks to decide that it was not worth staying in Kiralis' section. I switched to Lahr and have been the happier for it (although Lahr is no great shakes either). Further complaints--WeBWorK can be a major pain...it is not very forgiving in the answer format that it will accept. The case studies are pointless as most of the information you will need for them is spoon fed to you in class. The applet work was terrible...most of the applets were incomprehensible and not workable. The worst part of the course: THE TEXT IS A PIECE OF TRASH.

I wouldn't have minded if it was interesting, but it wasn't at all. Kiralis didn't stimulate any interest, either. The material seemed too basic for him because he didn't seem too interested, and when he was asked questions during class, his responses were sometimes given in a condescending manner. I wasn't motivated to do the work, and Webwork (an online homework program) didn't help. I hate that thing. It's such a hassle to do the work online, and it's still in its beginning stages so there are a lot of glitches in the program. All the homeworks counted towards your grade... I would've preferred to do them at my own pace. We also had to write essays on CSCs (Case Studies in Calculus) and those were just dumb. They tried to relate calc. to real life, and basically none of us really cared, except to get the points. I wouldn't recommend this course at all...

However, soon, we actually started doing, what I assume is calculus, although I don't know how a professor can go an entire lecture without mentioning the word derivative when that's what he is teaching. I am really glad that I had some background in the subject, because for the kids who didn't- they must have been lost. Kiralis should be kept as far away from a blackboard/computer screen as possible. He is the worst professor I have ever encountered in my entire life-and I thought nothing could be worse than my tenth grade english teacher. Not only did I feel like bashing my head into a brick wall every time I attended class, the homework only made me wish that hanover traffic was like NYC's so I could get hit by a car when I stepped out into the street. The whole computer-math deal was just not my thing. If you typed something in wrong- BOOM, \"error.\" It just wasn't working for me. There was no way to review your steps to the answer and it was just frustrating. The textbook was even worse; an 8 dollar piece of junk that you purchase at the copy center in thayer. The only thing it's good for is toilet paper. If two math professors at Dartmouth actually wrote this-may God have mercy on their souls because it is the most incomprehensive tool for gaining knowledge I have ever seen in my life. There are no practice problems and it's supplemented with online sections, so you have to use your computer to take advatage of the text. Quite annoying.

He seems completely uninterested in helping us to understand calculus. He is clearly teaching a class he doesn't want to teach. I'm sure he is either here for research or for upper level classes, but regardless of which, he shouldn't be teaching intro level calculus. Besides that, the class is set up very poorly, with mandatory internet \"WebWork\" online assignments. The Webwork assignments were my biggest complaint about the class. One had to complete about 7-10 problems twice a week, each with mulitple parts, over the topics that we had just learned in class. But the problems were very difficult and would not tell you what you did wrong if you missed them. They just gave you this awful \"Incorrect\" notation next to your answer, and you had to try it again. Often times you didn't miss the problem because of some mathematical error, but because you did not input the answer correctly into the computer correctly. And sometimes you would type in a correct answer, but you would have to type it a very specific way to get it right. Don't let them fool you into thinking that the computer recognizes 6/9 as 2/3, because sometimes it doesn't. In all, a tough class to take.

The professor lectured facing the board, skipping over parts that \"were too hard\" but that we needed to understand. We never felt our homework matched what had been taught. The homework itself was tedious to enter online, and there were also \"case studies,\" real-world modeling projects that used calculus. However, all that was required to complete these was to hunt down numbers that would answer the questions in a random applet, or from a class lecture. The tests didn't seem fair, but the curve made a 65 a B. Perhaps a strong dislike for math rendered my feelings so strong, but this course was poorly taught and constructed. The sequence of it made sense, but other than that I didn't like much. Since the course is a pre-req for many things, it is managable, with tutorial sessions and plenty of time on homework.

In other words, for each hour-long class, you really only get 30 minutes of lecture. I'm not opposed to group work, but the problems they give you are so much more difficult than the problems that they go over in the lecture or give as homework. The professors also aren't great at explaining things and I feel like they make the course more complicated and convoluted than it has to be. FYI, the exams were modeled off of the in-class activities, which we weren't told until after Midterm 1, which was annoying. There were also group assignments that were graded super harshly where they took points off if you didn't explain your work in prose in great detail. Overall, it felt like this class was very much got-cha. One thing I liked though is that there were lots of office hours that you could attend weekly. However, I felt Miller wasn't great at explaining things and I'm sure he's very smart because he tends to skip steps when explaining that often leaves you confused and in circles. I also noticed that he can be very condescending when it comes to not understanding something or when you ask too many questions in office hours, which kind of defeats the purpose of office hours. I also visited Logsdon's office hours, and felt that he was a lot nicer and a lot more accommodating (even went so far as to learn everyone's names even if they weren't in his section).

Also, you always have the opportunity to submit drafts for revision, so you can correct them for the final submission.

Beyond the lack of lecturing and reliance on prerecorded videos (which are pathetic), the biggest shortcoming is that Math 3 uses only webworks and not real problem sets, so there's never enough practice to get familiar with the style of questions they ask, let alone learn the material if you don't already know calculus. I can't imagine how hard this class would be if you have no calc experience. Nadia's from Quebec, and though her English seems good at first hearing, you'll quickly realize it's not up to the task. She struggles to understand what questions are asking and is often tongue-tied. Two of the other instructions in my term (all of whom make the videos you're supposed to watch) also didn't speak English natively, and they were even worse than Nadia.

The portfolio assignments were good overall- the profs gave us a list of objectives to meet for each assignment, we chose problems to solve in order to demonstrate our understanding of those objectives, and then we had to do a couple of explanatory paragraphs (connecting the objectives to other topics, what you learned, why you chose those specific problems as opposed to any other problem). We submitted rough drafts for these assignments, got feedback, and then were able to submit corrections to improve those grades. The problem-solving parts of the portfolios were very manageable but the explanations were annoying. Explaining math problems felt very repetitive and ingenuine; you kinda had to BS those parts. The WebWork problem sets were mostly ok (you get unlimited attempts at the problems), but some of the problems were very hard, especially towards the end of the course.

It was refreshing to have such a great math teacher after mediocre math instruction in high school, and I hope I have the opportunity to take another class with Professor Thompson in the future. We had a considerable amount of help along the way if we had difficulty at any point throughout the class. There were drop-in tutoring sessions every Sunday, as well as sessions on Tuesday or Thursday (depending on what day we were assigned to at the beginning of the course.) Both sessions were extremely helpful in clearing up any questions we had on webwork (or the written homework assignment) and solidified the concepts we had learned in class. The workload for this course was very manageable and further reinforced the material. At times, webwork did get a little tricky, but in those cases, Professor Thompson would go over similarly structured difficult problems towards the end of class.
