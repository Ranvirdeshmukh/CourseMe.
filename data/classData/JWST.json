You'll learn an incredible amount of context and history about the Middle East, both part and present; about political efforts to rewrite history and how states have manipulated narratives over genocide, colonialism, the US invasion of Iraq, etc. I'm not someone who speaks in class usually, but I genuinely really enjoyed engaging with the material. (It did get depressing at times because the films were so heavy on violence and suffering.) Prof Simon can really command an audience and facilitate discussion. Workload is moderate, at times felt a bit heavy - you have to watch a film for each class, sometimes readings too, and in the first half of the term we wrote weekly discussion posts. The final project is a lot. But the class in totality is absolutely worth it. Take this class - you will not regret it!!!\"",

Engaging, provocative, challenging (intellectually not workload wise) with an exceptional professor. Professor Simon reminds you why you pay the big bucks to go this school. He literally was in Cairo for Arab Spring -- the man is brilliant and funny and captivating to listen to. This is without a doubt the most I have learned in a Dartmouth class. The structure goes like this: two movies assigned per week plus some readings (and a discussion post). A couple students lead a discussion based on those materials and the whole class engages. Sounds simple yet it's quite effective. Beyond that, it's just a final! Not too shabby at all! You can write a 18 page paper, make a podcast + a 4 page paper, or do an art piece with an 8 page paper for that final. The last day of class, he brought us pizza and gave a little speech about how important this class was to him. I legitimately teared up. He is one of those professors that is intimidating, not because he is scary or intense, simply because you crave his approval. He is so eloquent and kind and just exactly what a professor should be. A+++++ for this class. I am a senior year and I am so happy I took this class. Wow. I am genuinely sad it is over.\""

We read widely, but the readings were not too long. I could almost PICTURE Jerusalem through taking this class. Prof. Behar will be missed.

She is not the most difficult grader (papers were the only required assignments, none of great length), but you must have an opinion and argue it, presenting both sides of the argument won't cut it. In short, take a course with Prof. Heschel- it will open your mind, make you a better person, and allow you to study with a respected scholar.

It's super easy in that there is really no work required out of you- you basically do two short papers or one long paper and it's on whatever you want and is however long you want and due whenever you want. That being said you can put as little or as much into the class as you want and you'll probably get out of it a corresponding happy feeling. Aside from being ridiculously easy in that there was really little work, (also you never know what your grade is so if you're someone who worries about that type of thing it may be a little anxiety-inducing), it's a really revolutionary course in a lot of ways. Benor's lectures are FASCINATING. He'll completely dive into seemingly random topics in insane amounts of detail and then elegantly pull them together in this beautiful construction of genius. He also is insanely well read in a lot of different disciplines and routinely pulls together tons of connections (AHHH GO TO OFFICE HOURS THIS MAN IS A GENIUS). Benor also completely challenges the way you read. He'll spend all class lecturing on two sentences. He's really good at emphasizing slowing down and really taking in and wrestling with what is being said. That being said, the class is sort of like listening to a brilliant man lecture about really random things and it's hard to keep in mind what ideas are connected to what because the timeline Benor mentions is very loose and he doesn't really give big picture ideas as much as lots and lots of random detail. He also assumes basic Jewish knowledge which I did not have at all so was a little lost in the beginning. I think that if you're not interested in the topic this class would be really boring, but if you're interested it will blow your mind. Just getting to know Benor is such a treat. But don't expect him to \"assign\" you things or \"explain\" why he focuses on what he does. Tying the class together is sort of on you.\"",

There are interesting nuggets in them, its coming from a brilliant man for sure. But you wont understand Kabbalah until you pick up some other books not assigned in the course, like Scholems Lectures. Then you can begin to understand whats going on. There is no introduction to Jewish mysticism.

Heschel is a lovely person, but her lectures were extremely disorganized. She often tried turning our 100 person class into a discussion, and then ridiculed the class when no one would speak up. Obviously, people didn't speak up because there are 100 people in the room, but Heschel seemed to think that no one would speak because no one did the reading. Of course some students did not do the reading, but I mostly think that people were just so scared to talk. 4 quizzes, and you definitely need to study a bit for them. The midterm was also hard, but there is Extra Credit opportunities. You can easily get the grade you want, but I think very few people leave this class satisfied. Unless you're dying for an A and an easy class, I would recommend taking some more interesting, better organized.\""

We were warned, but that blurb in the seminar listing just looked so good. And truth be told, the material is very interesting. I was amazed at the things I read, by the genius of the authors we studied. What destroys any possibility of enjoying this class, though, is Alan Lelchuk. The man is unbearable. Where to start? He is absolutely arrogant. Yes, he knows the material, but he is unwilling to compromise during a discussion. If he disagrees with what you say, he will simply cut you of mid-sentence with a resounding \"No.\" He loves to tell personal stories (by the way, this is a good way to get him on an hour-long tangent: ask a personal question) like when he had dinner with Saul Bellow or when he was in Israel with Grace Paley. He is of the opinion that only someone at his level can understand this literature. What he says is right and what we think is wrong. The man tries to pit students against each other in class. Rather than be the bad guy, he preys on us. e.g. \"Dan, what is wrong with what Mary just said?\" He's downright rude. He calls students by patronizing names like \"Krissy.\" No less than three times this term he called me anti-Semitic for expressing an ill opinion of one of his beloved authors. He told me he hopes I am unhappy in life because he disagrees with my aspirations. He thinks the South is backwards and back-woods and that Saul Bellow is the only saving grace of American Literature. He is narrow-minded and will not hesitate to share his biases, but heaven forbid you should express any. Still want to take the class? Go ahead, it's do-able. After all that, he did say that my work was ingenious, and I am looking at an A-/A in the class. Just remember some vital advise. (I know this review is getting really long, but you will thank me later.) -Speak in class, don't wait for him to call on you. He will be impressed with your willingness to share, and after all, you have a better chance of saying something \"right\" if you say a lot. -Keep up with the readings and offer specific comments so he knows you did them. For that matter, make sure you know what the reading is. Lelchuk is vague, so pin him down at the end of the class and get from him exactly what you should read for next time and exactly which books you should bring to class. -Get all assignments in writing. He gives spoken instructions, so it is up to you to demand a syllabus and written essay prompts. This is crucial. On more than one occasion, the essay topic changed between the time it was assigned and when it was turned in. -Don't diss classmates. He will try to make you take sides, but it is essential to remain respectful. Preface your arguments with, \"I like John's point about xyz, but I also think...\" Students in the class will get through it by uniting against Lelchuk, so don't alienate anyone - that's his job. -Listen to Lelchuk's criticism, remember not to make the same \"mistake\" on the next paper, and most importantly, laugh it off. Don't take it personally, it's not you, it's him. Good Luck. Brace Yourself.\"",

Although one of the main objectives of a seminar is too improve your writing, practically no work was done in this area.

How much can you really expect to improve in your writing if you hand in a final draft of a paper, and get back a grade with minimal comments and no follow-up on it? The course material was fairly interesting. However, we were often told to read over 100 pages up to 275 pages for the next class period. It was one of those classes where the professor assumes you have infinite time for his subject alone. I would fairly recommend the course if it was not taught by professor Lelchuk. He was neither accomodating nor personable. He had a habit of making large negative comments on each students work in front of the whole class, and generally had a negative attitude. He wasn't very enthusiastic about the class, and it seemed like he kind of felt it was a burden to him. Many students were sick with a variety of this winter's large amount of communicable diseases, but none were met with much sympathy, just anger for \"copping out\". One student even cried when he snapped at her in the middle of class for her pinkeye! Overall, I haven't heard from a single person who received a grade that they felt to be a fair assessment of their work. I know a few people who have cried over his comments to them, and everyone in the class seemed to have an abnormal amount of grief compared to any other class. In short, IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.\""

But you DO have to go to class. Benor is a genius, and you have to actively pay attention to follow his lectures. But if you do, you can get a sense of how he analyzes things and attempt to apply the same process to the 2 essays. They are really short, 2 pages max, but you really do have to think a ton before you start writing. They aren't research papers, you shouldn't attempt to encorporate the readings into your essays, you should just review your notes and and think about your response. That's it. The midterm and final are both in class tests where there are several one-sentence questions that require a ton of thought, but just a 2-3 sentence answer. Benor is a big fan of brevity, he really only wants the right answer and no BS. You may not know the right answer, but studying won't really help, just understanding the material and being able to apply it to something new is the point. And you'll probably get some credit for something that shows knowledge of the material even if it's not the right answer. And to help even more, you don't have to answer all the questions--3 of 4 on the midterm and 5 of 9 on the final. Each graded assignment is weighted equally, 25% for the two exams and two essays. I really enjoyed this course. It was one of the few courses where I put almost nothing in outside of class but still learned a ton. The ideas discussed in class really made me think, and I found myself talking about the philosophical stuff randomly throughout the term. This course is NOT what you're expecting. It really shouldn't be titled \"Intro to Judaism\" it should be \"Intro to Philosophy and History of Jewish Thought\" If you're looking to understand the religion, this wont' really help much. It's about the way the religion transformed over the past 4000 years based on the way Jews relate to biblical texts and to the rise of other religions--mainly Christianity and Islam.

The essays are mostly subjective and the identification choices were ridiculous. If you have 0 time to devote to a class, take this one and enjoy the ride. This class both excited me and depressed me at the same time. I have always wanted a Gut class to take at Dartmouth but it really was a waste of time.

Therefore, I made the mistake of skipping lecture, or sleeping during them, thinking that there was no way that I was going to understand the material. However, when I actually paid attention, the lectures were very thoughtfully crafted and interesting. I also skipped pretty much ALL of the reading, which I ended up liking when I had to read for the papers. In the end, this class can be whatever you want it to be. If you really want to know about Judaism, you will learn about the religion on a level above what most people know. On the other hand, if you want a gut class, you can not do any of the reading except for the papers and still get a good grade (I would suggest going to class because half of the tests are based on lecture).

The 2 papers require a lot of thought, but Benor is a fair grader. The midterm and final each have a short in-class definition and a paper. The course is almost entirely skewed toward philosophy and reasoning rather than history. This is not a timeline type class where you move through important dates and people. Rather you move through different schools of thought and how they relate to each other in shaping the religion. The more you put into this course, the more you will get out of it.

Her lecture notes were extremely important to the tests so even if you aren't always fully prepared for class, make sure you attend class!! She even put up her notes on Blackboard, which really helps you review them for finals, but don't count on using them because if you haven't gone to class, they'll look confusing to you. Take this class because you have an interest in ancient Israelite culture and the Hebrew bible- how it differs from Christian perspectives.. it's actually pretty fascinating.\"",
            "review 18: \"02F with Susan Ackerman: Ackerman truly makes this course interesting. Her lectures are engaging, well-planned and her animated teaching style helps you stay awake. She has a clear understanding of the material and makes herself available outside of class. I never thought I would be interested in Ancient Israelite history but by the end of the course I wanted more.\"",
            "review 19: \"02F with Susan Ackerman: Prof. Ackerman is by far the best professor I have had at Dartmouth. She is an outstanding lecturer - always very prepared with interesting lectures but was very flexible if the class had other questions or concerns. I was very unsure about the class material at the very beginning, but it turned out to be a great history and background to the Hebrew Bible. Readings were not too difficult, and midterm/final were very fair tests of what we had gone over. There is one paper, 6 - 8 pages, but you have 4 weeks to do it, with one draft that goes to the Prof/writing assistant. If you can fit it into your schedule, TAKE THIS COURSE!\"",
            "review 20: \"02F with Susan Ackerman: I really think that Professor Ackerman is the best teacher at Dartmouth. No kidding. She knows so much, is really smart, and is also funny. Her paper assignments and exams force you to think about the material in new ways and truly test your understanding. Her questions and comments during class do the same. Class discussions were uniformly great. Add to this the importance of knowing and understanding the Bible, and this class simply cannot be missed. No one should graduate without having taken it, regardless of her major.\"",
            "review 21: \"02F with Susan Ackerman: I never thought the bible could ever be interesting, but this class made this a good semester.\"",
            "review 22: \"02F with Susan Ackerman: Obviously this course is taught at a secular institution, so it draws very academic conclusions, but that's how it ought to be at a place like this. Ackerman is a good, engaging prof with lectures that ask a lot of questions and aren't just regurgitating the readings. If you want to know bible history, it's an ideal course. If you dont, then it'd probably be pretty boring.\""

            "review 1: \"08S with Karen B.: Professor Stern is INCREDIBLE! She was fun, gorgeous, and a fair grader. Unfortunately, she's a visiting prof, so I do not know if she'll come back to teach the course again. But, even with a different prof, I think the course would still be interesting. I had never taken a religion class of any kind before, so I found all the new ideas very interesting. If you need a TMV distrib credit, I would take this class.\"",
