You'll be in a team (ours were 4 people each), and work with a real-life organization/partner on a particular project involving the field research methods the class goes over. Because of this, the workload is very back-weighted. There's a literature review in the middle of the term (which is a decent bit of work), and some short completion assignments throughout the term, but the major workload is near the end of the term, when you're putting together your final scope of work (the detailed plan of what your research will entail), and presenting it to the profs and your organization partner. Overall, it's a lot of fun, and it's pretty cool that the projects are grounded in real-life work. Definitely take the class if this sounds fun!\"",

Did not appreciate Sosin's communication via email (emailed once about a health issue and she totally ignored the email) and she ignored other emails, too. Feel like I didn't learn a ton here and the readings were optional, at best. Also wasn't a huge fan of working in the same group for an entire term.

            "review 1: \"21F with Herschel Nachlis: I implore you to never take a class with Herschel Nachlis. He is EASILY the worst professor I have had at Dartmouth. We had to write a weekly 3-5 page memo based on the readings for this class and it took him six weeks to grade our first six memos. So we had no feedback whatsoever until the class was over halfway done. Also, he simply has no social skills and that made every \"discussion\" awkward and not beneficial to our learning. For the travel component of this class, since it was still COVID, we went to D.C. instead of going international. Based on what I've said so far, you can imagine how traveling and spending 12 days with this man might be. Complete chaos, obviously. Details about the trip like meeting locations, meeting times, per diems, etc. were changing constantly. And not due to external factors either, purely due to his incompetence. When we actually sat down for these meetings, he would not even introduce us or describe what the class was about to the people with whom we were meeting. He would just say we were excited to talk to them and the students would have to apologize for his ineptitude and actually run the meeting while he sat back, completely unaware of how socially inept he is. I can understand that some people just have no social skills and can't change that. And that's fine, but those people should not be in charge of leading students on a 12-day trip where we meet with important people. Nachlis is a horrible representative of Dartmouth College and I would be shocked if any of the people we met with ever want to meet with him again. HOWEVER, he is completely self-aware about how disorganized he is, he just chooses not to fix it. For example, at the end of the trip he offered to provide the email addresses of the people with whom we met in D.C. so we could follow up/network with them. When I asked him for the email addresses of the people with whom we met, he said (and I quote): \"As you might imagine, I didn't keep such a list.\" This guy is a horrible prof and it is my fervent wish that he is dismissed from Dartmouth as soon as anyone with any power to do so removes their heads from the sand and realizes how bad he is. At the very least, I hope he doesn't get tenure.\"",

While he was disorganized at times during the class and the trip component, I learned a ton in the class and I am glad that I took it with him. He was really good about hearing student voices, and I thought he facilitated discussions very well. The discussions in this class were among the best I have had at Dartmouth, and although the weekly papers were sometimes a pain, they made sure that everyone did the readings and had something interesting to say rather than just parroting buzz words as often occurs in discussion-based classes. Sure, there were some things he could have improved upon (getting us papers back quicker, being more organized) and he is a little awkward (which he openly acknowledges), but he is not an awful person as the other review makes him out to be so I would take the harsh review above with a grain of salt. Our discussions with the speakers were great and they stayed and often had dinner with us, and we had a lot of room to ask them questions beyond just the class. I would take the class with Nachlis again if given the chance.\"",

Shaiko has very open and flexible office hours especially in the lead up to a project, so I would strongly recommend bringing a copy in advance for him to take a look. Like his other courses, Shaiko grades a lot on formatting and other surface levels items, rather than substance. Pay close attention to the formatting and all his other requirements as they will not be mentioned anywhere on Canvas or anywhere except in class. Throughout the course I was never worried about receiving a B+ or lower, so take that as you want.\"",

Moreover, you only get to choose your group for the last project, so your experience can definitely vary depending on who you work with. Shaiko definitely has specific formats he wants us to follow, but he is always open and available to go over your work and give feedback. I recommend finishing a draft a couple days early and then presenting it to Shaiko because he will tell you what he wants. In class you don't really work on the projects, so the two hours is mostly lecture style. He had some really cool guest speakers and there was even a session on public speaking that was really helpful.

He gave me a B- on my final project (a partner project where groups are assigned--unfortunately i got unlucky and my partner didn't do anything) because I was sick during the class where he explained how he wanted the paper to be formatted and I did the formatting differently. He also refused to grade me separately from my partner. In terms of workload, we had hundreds of pages assigned for each class on top of three big policy research projects. The readings are totally irrelevant to class, so if you do end up taking this then don't buy the textbooks. The lectures are super dull and they go on forever. The guest lectures are very interesting and seeing students present their projects was cool, so I think I would have enjoyed this class if Shaiko wasn't the one teaching it.

The first project is fake nonsense meant to get you writing and formatting in the style Shaiko wants for the PRS, and the third project is a Social Impact Practicum component where you do grant-writing for a real non-profit. It's cool that Projects 2 and 3 have real-world significance, but also weird that this class is really just a workshop for these different projects. The PRS is a cool opportunity, and if you're interested in doing it, you should take 45. But if not there's really no reason to take this class. It's weirdly hard to get an A bc Shaiko is very nitpicky about real minor stylistic things, but it isn't hard to complete the three projects (as long as you have good group members).\"",

Readings look unreal, but there is no midterm or final, so in reality reading is kind of irrelevant. On the flip side, it makes you think like a researcher, and you work on projects that actually are given to you by State Senators, nonprofits, etc. It makes it pretty sick. Professor: This is my second class with Professor Shaiko, and he is still a mystery to me. He appears cold and uncaring, but if you put in the work, he will work with you. He's a man of few words, but he is super knowledgeable in public policy/govt. In this class, however, he does not help you so much as he designs the class so that you become adept in doing research yourself.

            "review 14: \"07F with Ronald Shaiko: A lot of courses I've taken at Dartmouth (e.g., in the Government Department) are very theory-based. While it is nice to occasionally delve into abstract issues to see which theoretical model fits best for an event, PBPL 45 was an extremely refreshing change of pace from all that. But before I can extol this course's strengths, some background information is necessary. The New Hampshire and Vermont state legislatures consist of part-time, unpaid legislators who generally have no staff. Many are retired, and a good portion never even attended college. Unlike other state legislatures (like California's and New York's), the NH & VT ones don't have always have the resources or expertise to delve into important policy issues. Thus they are more reliant on third-party groups to help supply that information. That's where the Rockefeller Center's Policy Research Shop comes in. The PRS is a non-partisan think-tank that provides non-partisan, objective research for the New Hampshire and Vermont state legislatures. A legislator requests the PRS to look into a topic, then groups of roughly three students work together to research the topic, the students work with Rocky staff to refine their skills, and then the students testify to the state legislature to present the results of their 10-page reports. In PBPL 45, you choose from a list of topics to take on, and work with classmates to begin research on the project. Topics this term included: highway funding, riparian zone protection, cellulosic ethanol, mental health in prisons, state broadband Internet access, financial literacy, and a few others. PBPL 45 also serves as a prerequisite to work in the PRS for future terms - for course credit, or for pay. So you technically start working for the PRS when you take the course, and have the option of continuing your work in subsequent terms. I found this class to be extremely practical for several reasons. First of all, you're researching real issues for influential people: there is no doubt in your mind that your research will help improve VT/NH state policies. Secondly, to maximize the value of the research you do, you have to work on your research, writing, and presentation skills - all three of which are always useful to improve. Thirdly, when applying for jobs, PRS experience is an amazing way to distinguish yourself from other people; after all, how many people can say they've done research for, and then testified to, state governments? Whether or not you want to work for a government-related career, this experience would definitely help you. Although the essence of the class is doing research on your given topic, we also had two peripheral assignments: updating an outdated policy paper, and writing a grant proposal. The policy paper update was a little trivial, but the grant proposal (which was due during finals period) was a fun, laid-back assignment. As the other reviews for this course suggest, the reading assignments throughout the class were manageable. I'd like to point out how this class pays much more attention to refining presentation skills than the average class. Not only do you get a PowerPoint & public speaking lesson, but throughout the class each student ended up speaking in front of the class four times (with only one of them having a PPT). After each time we spoke, there were multiple opportunities for feedback both on the substance and delivery of our presentations. The only downside to the class is that it is somewhat time-consuming. Contrary to what the number suggests, Professor Shaiko refers to PBPL 45 as a \"seminar-level class.\" We used most of the x-hours, and it always seemed like there was some assignment we had to fervently work on. Policy Project II (the one where you work for the PRS) was by far the most time-consuming part of the course, since it was the only group project, some groups received their assignments 1-2 weeks earlier than others, and some assignments were more difficult than others. For those who don't know him, Professor Shaiko is definitely a good professor. He's extremely knowledgeable about a wide variety of policy issues. He's also the most accessible professor I've ever had in terms of office hours - you can visit him in his office basically anytime throughout the day. He's more than happy to spend time talking to you and answering your questions. As assignment deadlines roll around, he also stays well past 5 PM, and even comes in on weekends. When Prof. Shaiko applied last year for PRS funding, the Ford Foundation realized the potential and granted $300,000 for the Policy Research Shop. If you're interested in making a difference and doing substantive work, then I'd suggest that you take advantage of one of the best opportunities Dartmouth has to offer.\"",

The class is really about the projects (one on Medicaid, one major group project on a specific policy issue, and one on grant writing and presenting). The group project was an enormous amount of work, but we studied with some of the best experts at Dartmouth and ended up presenting our findings multiple times to a committee in the NH House of Representatives (incredible experience).

The pre-req is any stats class but the exception was made for students and then anything coding was taught in Stata (so learning R was a waste). Every project is a group project except for the problem set which means one group member gets to do it all! Horray! This class is not the sharky-Gov/PbPl kids you've come to expect from these classes. Honestly, I miss those kids because at least they know stuff and get stuff done. There were so many kids in this class who didn't literally a single thing or were just so unknowledgeable about anything tbh. The entire class is dependent on what group you get and your project. Some of the grants, for example, were so hard to write because the NGOs changed what they wanted the grant for so often and some were so easy to write because they were for a specific purpose. Also, it's past finals period right now and over 50% of the class isn't grade. No presentation grades have been put in, and the presentations were HORRIBLE because of it. Every group went over time because there were no consequences. Grades are likely going to be all vibes because if not, there's going to be a B median. There is so much assigned reading that I just never did but that meant that I actually learning nothing besides from the assignments. Lectures were so pointless.

Less of a hostile learning environment, more dull, but a similar lack of organization. The class was all based on group projects (so group members really matter!!) that have no instructions and the only feedback we got was illegible and 5+ weeks after we turned them in. First stats project was super broad and irrelevant to the rest of the class, second project was ok because you are actually doing something but grading was wild, third project was writing a grant for an NGO that doesn\u2019t need it and serves some weird niche that frankly should not be funded. I also feel like I learned nothing in this class other than to never donate to an upper valley nonprofit. Every class was a waste of time and none of the readings were worth doing.

Professor Kalish provides excellent feedback to help you grow as a writer and communicator. The students in the class were all extremely smart which could be intimidating at times during discussion but go to Prof Kalish (early in the term - whether it be after class or in OH) and ask her to look over drafts; you can replace your score on the individual paper with each latest draft. Workload definitely ramps up towards the end with the campaign project, so if you stay on top of your paper / campaign early on in the term you will have a less stressful end of term. The final deliverable is so satisfying to turn in as a culmination of all your hard work.\"",

The work is manageable BUT it is not a guaranteed layup, which I learned the hard way. A few tips if you do take the class to avoid ending up with a stressful last few weeks (like I did): 1. Go to office hours, ask for feedback, submit drafts, etc etc WAY more than you think you need to. A big part of your grade is the \u201cprocess grade\u201d which can either bring your grade up or down a whole letter. The process grade is based on your performance beyond just assignment-specific numerical grade values. So things like class participation, timeliness with assignments, revision effort, division of work in your group, etc can be the difference between an A- and a B+. When in doubt, turn in a draft in advance. 2. Week 1 of the class you pick a campaign topic to work on for the entire term. Pick the least complicated, most feasible topic, even if it\u2019s not the most exciting. The more research/work that exists already on your topic, the better. 3. You\u2019ll be asked to rank your choice of topics and to request group members, and then to say which of the two is more important to you. Best advice would be to say group members are more important. This is *the* most popular senior spring pubpol class for a reason (it\u2019s usually a layup) so make sure you\u2019re in a group with people who are on the same page as you about how much work you plan to put in for the class (best bet is other seniors).\"",
            "review 4: \"22S with Julie Kalish: This was a great course, whether it be for interest, an art distrib (particularly if you are avoiding traditional art classes), or for Professor Kalish. A lot of seniors take it, and it's a nice class community because of the many class discussions. A lot of the weeks had a lighter workload, but the policy campaign paper and media campaign were time consuming. It was neat doing work that seemed applicable to the real world, such as (in groups) writing a letter to the editor, creating a media campaign (creating social media, website, flyers, etc), writing a keynote address, and a strategy memo and campaign timeline. This class reminds me of ENGS 12 project 6, but you are focusing on policy specific issues, and it is a lot less work. It was satisfying to turn in the binder with all the campaign materials at the end. It's a fun class, and Professor Kalish is one of my favorite professors at Dartmouth. She provides lots of feedback and is always available during office hours./\"",

The term is dedicated to an issue campaign in small groups, which means all the work is related to the campaigns (i.e., writing a keynote speech, making video ads, writing op-eds, media, etc.). It is a lot of fun and very rewarding when the campaign is done at the end.\"",

I learned so much about the intersection of economics and public policy! The class also had a manageable workload, although there was about 3-4 hours of reading for each class meeting (twice per week since PBPL040 is generally a 10A). It consisted of one pop quiz per week on the reading (worth 15 percent of our grade collectively), a midterm (25 percent), a group presentation (10 percent), a final exam (25 percent), and a policy memo (worth 25 percent of our grade, but students could do a rewrite and the final grade was an average of the two grades). It\u2019s also very manageable for students - like me - who have not previously taken econ.

I did fine in the class and really enjoyed each class because he's a very interesting lecturer and the material is fascinating, so this isn't coming from resentment because of a poor grade. First, the class is ALL lecture. If that's your thing, great! But he has a very specific planned out lecture and often asks the class questions during each class (where it can often feel like a competition of who is smartest and quickest to raise their hand-- I noticed a lot of the people on the shy side never speak up because of this which was sad) to which he has a VERY specific pre-planned answer in his head that he wants the student to regurgitate. He has a few examples that he uses to illustrate things in his various books (which are quite good) but isn't very receptive to new points of view or discussing the topic in question. Instead, he wants you to see it the way that he does and use the examples that he keeps coming back too. The midterm and exam are extremely tricky and frustrating because even if you understand everything well each question is short answer (aka long paragraphs) and you can receive up to 5 points. In order to get all 5 you have to read his mind and think like he does-- mention the examples HE likes, be very specific, cover everything that he wants you to touch on, etc. It's essentially playing a mind game with him which I personally really dislike, but I know some people prefer that. The policy memo is flexible and pretty fun! I didn't NOT like this class but it's really tailored to a specific type of student and how well you can suck up (he definitely plays favorites, even though it's not with bad intentions), it was just not quite as amazing as I thought given all of the incredible reviews. Oh, and also the \"pop\" quizzes are super easy they're just to make sure you did the reading (which can be a ridiculous amount honestly) but he makes them very very simple which is nice.

The readings are long, but they are rarely redundant and almost all of the articles he presents to you say something different, engaging, new, and relevant (you should read to do well on his exams). He really wants you to learn. He sticks to the B+ median as all govt professors do, but he rewards improvement over the course of the term. This year we had a midterm W5 and a second \"midterm\" week 9 that was 1/3 cumulative and 2/3 material from the second half of the course. Because of that, we didn't have a final and there was no final paper. In addition to the readings (about 120 pgs/week) there were 7 weekly \"reflections\" (~3-4 pg papers) that you write about the readings. Obviously, this requires a lot of time out of class, but class itself was engaging, entertaining, and productive.

The three papers were really quite interesting to right, but the midterm and final were very content based, so make sure to start studying early. His lectures are all over the place and he tends to go off into many tangents, but you don't need to take notes on everything he says. Papers: They were fun to write honestly. LOVES format- go to him in office hours and he will help you. For the third assignment, do an amicus brief. Trust me; it seems they got the highest grades and were easier to write with the little outline/ info he gives on the papers. Do not do a memorandum - he wants it in a super specific manner and was super harsh on grading. Final/midterm: These were annoying. 1hr 5min for the midterm and 3 hours for the final (the same length - 3/4 short answers and 1 essay). He loves loves loves examples, so when studying for the midterm and final make sure you know examples of the committees and associations. I did better on the midterm because I studied more and paid attention (and binge read Birkland which helped a lot). The final was all about the policy domains so know those!!!

The homework is reading and pretty heavy but I only read the Birkland text which was sufficient. I wouldn't bother reading the other books. The papers are very interesting and fun to write -- you can essentially choose any current policy issue or interest group you are interested in and frame your paper around that. Shaiko will read over your paper and give you feedback in office hours which is very helpful. His assignments aren't super in depth but if you go to office hours he will be very straightforward with whether or not you're writing to what he's looking for. The midterm and final were both a little sketchier, the questions aren't easy per say but you can usually sketch out some form of an answer.

The stories about people being kiss ups and competitive are true, but if you have friends people in the class who you're friends with you'll bond through the shared hatred for these people. Cannot stress enough how important it is to go to office hours for all of the assignments. He doesn't really grade on content because he has like 100 assignments to go through, so formatting is everything (and he has a specific way he likes it). In terms of the midterm and finals, it's a lot of material, but if you get a start on reviewing it early do it!!! WRITE YOUR SHORT ANSWERS AND ESSAYS USING BULLET POINTS AND OUTLINES. I know people who I did better on the midterm and final on who we talked about the exact same material, but I got a higher grade since I used bullet points. for the midterm, know the heuristics models really well, for the final, know the policy grid really well. Overall, if you go to office hours for assignments and somewhat?? do the readings you should be more than likely to get at least an B+/A- in the class, which is all you need for fellows now that Shaiko isn't on the selection committee.\"",

To reiterate previous reviews, you do not need to do all the readings. That being said, Birkland is incredibly helpful, so make sure to read that one. Shaiko doesn't give rubrics for his 3 assignments, so it can be very frustrating to try and figure out what he wants for each assignment....it's especially frustrating bc he is really nitpicky. I found out too late in the term that he is willing to read over your paper; DO THIS. A lot of people in the class who do well just straight up get him to look over their papers during office hours and he'll tell u what he's looking for. Lectures are a bit all over the place at the beginning but become clearer at the end of the course. Honestly, I really enjoyed this course overall (I hated it around week 3-5 but that was just because his expectations are hard to meet) Side note: I'm sorry in advance for the freshmen trying to get into First-Year Fellows.

First of all, Shaiko assigns a LOT of readings, but I found that not all of them are actually super useful. The readings I would recommend at least skimming through are Birkland (probably the one you should actually read in-depth) and The Art of Policymaking. Don't buy the Essential Readings: the book costs a lot, and I didn't end up reading/using it at all. In terms of class structure, there are 3 short assignments, a midterm, and a final. The short assignments are not too bad--as long as you talk to Shaiko and understand what exactly he is looking for, you should be okay. On the other hand, the midterm and final were a little more challenging. The midterm wasn't too bad if you studied, but the final was a lot more than expected, even though we were given three hours (3 short 250-word answer qs with approx. 6 parts each, 1 400-word longer essay). Honestly, if you put in the work, an A- should be very achievable. However, getting an A is slightly more challenging.

Although I found them interesting, and its a more in depth look at what Shaiko casually mentions in class, they were not necessary for the essays and slightly useful for the exams. Since the class was so big, Shaiko kept the essays really short. And you get a lot of creative freedom with them, so they were pretty fun to complete. The class was all lecture, and almost everything he covers in class is on the exams. There were a few guests, like the author of the book we had to read, and that was really cool. You're definitely going to learn more about the policy domains (health, environmental, education etc.), and the overall policy process. Shaiko is extremely knowledgeable and will frequently talk about his experiences in Congress which I thought was really interesting. He also held virtual lunches for us during his x-hour and would tell more stories. So yes this class has its bad parts, but it has a lot of good parts too. There is no attendance nor participation requirement and the lectures are recorded. That being said, I would still recommend attending class so you don't miss anything before he starts the recording (Shaiko was not too apt at Zoom).\"",

He also assigned an exorbitant amount of reading work, a lot of which wasn't necessary or beneficial. I felt as if I was fully teaching myself the course content, and time in class was being wasted regularly. We had three writing assignments, none of which were long in length, but Shaiko explained the rubric and what he was expecting after we already had the essays submitted. I consistently found that I would get positive feedback on the content aspect of all of my writing assignments, but would get much lower grades because of unnecessary, specific details in the formatting of each assignment (Failing to include a mailing address for a fake and made-up interest group, not using subheaders when there was no explanation that it was required on the assignment, etc.). Exams were frustrating as well, because Shaiko would expect us to answer ten questions in one response, but only allow us to write 200 word responses. This restricted my ability to go in depth and fully answer the questions, and my grade would suffer. I understand Shaiko lowering the word amount to allow himself to have less work to read, but he simultaneously expected his students to cover a lot of content with very little words to do so, and that was angering to me. This class is obviously a necessary prerequisite, just be prepared for an awful ten weeks.\"",

Important stuff to keep in mind: you don't have to do all the readings! Figure out which ones are relevant/cover relevant topics. Shaiko likes to go off on tangents a lot, not everything is relevant so don't feel like you have to write everything he says down. There are a lot of kids who think that by participating as much as possible they maximize their chance to get into First-Year Fellows - they are wrong, the kids who speak the most often don't get in. You don't have to speak at all outside of small group discussions, most people don't talk during lectures as there is no participation grade. Let your work speak for itself. With that being said, this class is not too hard (relatively speaking) if you show up to class and do the work on time. The most time-consuming part of it would be the readings, so make sure you are being efficient with them. Not too easy to get an A normally, 21W is probably an anomaly because it was online so apparently grades were inflated a bit. An A- is probably achievable without too much stress for most people who do the work. TLDR; watch out for tryhard freshmen, do only the readings that matter, show up to class, A- achievable with some effort, A takes a bit more.\"",

Generally felt unstructured and that Shaiko was largely just talking about what he felt was relevant/wanted to discuss. The reading assignments are very heavy, but a lot of it wasn't helpful in the end, so don't feel like you have to do it all. The \"Essential Readings\" book was just an overpriced collection of dense and largely useless papers on policy theory, and the important parts are covered in the Birkland book, so don't bother with that. The assignments are more interesting, although how he grades them seemed rather arbitrary. The exams seemed even more arbitrary. Don't expect to get an A often. That being said, I think it would have been hard to get a truly bad grade assuming you don't totally slack off.

Despite these shortcomings, the assignments for the class have been very interesting and leave a lot of room for creativity, although I would definitely suggest having Shaiko read over your essays in office hours before turning them in because otherwise his grading will come off as subjective and unfair.

I rarely enjoyed the work, which sucked b/c there's so much. Shaiko seems like a decent guy & has had a really interesting career/knows his stuff. But the intro class was just painful.\"",

Unfortunately, there were an insane amount of readings, which was really overwhelming at first. I was told we didn't need to read everything, which was good because I don't know how it would have been humanly possible to read everything without sacrificing significant amounts of fun/sleep. Professor Shaiko is a decent guy, and he provides a lot of time out of class where he's available to meet. He's quite dry, though, and lectures often deviated from readings and went on many different tangents. Overall, it was only all right, but unfortunately necessary for any further study in public policy. I also began to intensely dislike the American political system as a result of taking the course.\"",

The lectures were good at the beginning but after the midterm they got really boring. The writing assignments were pretty interesting, but they were not like normal papers. They were more about practicing the types of writing used in day to day government business. Also, there was a TON of reading. DO NOT BOTHER to open the green book--I think it is called the Essential Readings. They are really dense and I think the vast majority of the class didn't read them.

Also, he is very flexible with office hours, WHICH YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO TO! Shaiko is the man!

Some Negatives to the Class: - A good number of intense people take this class, because more than half the class is trying to get the First-Year Fellowship. However, if you do not let them get to you then you will enjoy the class. - He doesn't make thorough remarks on papers because it is such a huge class, so you should go to office hours to talk about the papers. - YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ ALL THE BOOKS!

            "review 57: \"08W with Ronald Shaiko: DEATH. This is the word that comes to my mind when I think of the 3 hours every week I spent listening to Prof. Shaiko lecture...but I can't call it lecture...maybe spew? Yeah spew...thats probably the best word for it. Every class Shaiko would spew out information on the policy topic of the day. No structure. No organization. PPT? Please...Shaiko's old school...he breaks out the overhead projector on occasion. Am I a massochist? Is that why I continually forced myself out of bed to go to class at 10 am? I think I had the perpetual hope that the class would magically switch formats and actually inform me of something! Anything! But it never did. Actually, the spewing in the last class on welfare policy was kinda informative. But until then...at the end of every class I would look at my few lines of scribbles in my notebook and be completely bewildered about how I could have just sat through an hour talk and not learn a single thing. It was truly a marvel...a wonder. I like Shaiko a lot. Really I do...he is a great guy who spent lots of time in Washington and knows everything there is to know about public policy...certainly everything we needed to learn in this intro class. I'm sure his upper-level policy courses are much more productive. But he seriously would just stand up there and spew things...99.9 % irrelevant at that. You learn the course material from the readings which are simple to understand though the most boring things the world has ever seen. Ironically every book besides \"The Essential Readings\" is essential to the class and learning about the policy process. While expensive, I don't know why anyone complained about too much reading...there really was not that much. If you know you want to go into government or minor in policy then take this course (or want that internship). You will learn about how Washington works...I feel like I've benefitted from the material...just not the actual class time. Someone else in the department needs to take over this intro...Shaiko is just not cut out for the structured kinds of lectures needed for this type of course. Before I end my review I have to comment on previous reviews. A few of my peers said the class was interesting??!!!???!!!!!!!!!! To them I say you must simply be living in a different universe than me. Interesting?? Really?? I wish I knew who you are just so I could talk with you and meet people that are so fundamentally different than me. I dutifully went to every class and did all the \"non-essential\" readings. Interesting would seriously be the absolute last word I would use in the English language to describe Public Policy 5. I'm not a political buff to say the least, but if you are you will find this class redundant, and if you aren't then you are faced with probably the most boring information being taught at the college or possibly the world. While you may think this is exaggeration...just take the course and enjoy.\"",

You learn to cut corners in readings and determine what's important and what's not, but you have to keep yourself motivated because there's no homework to keep yourself accountable (just 3 papers, 2 exams). Shaiko knows a lot, it's just that he's had a lot of experience in public policy so he tends to teach from experience instead of from the text. He doesn't really brag about what he's done, but it's definitely not the totally traditional stuffy academic type class.

Shaiko graded papers pretty hard and he graded exams even harder. The way he graded seemed very arbitrary. There were two exams composed of all short-answer questions and 3 papers. A lot of unneccessary work for an intro. class. When Shaiko graded the short answer exam questions he didn't even have a rubric. When I asked him what made a good response he didn't really know. He just said it was relative to what other people wrote. The public policy department (if you can even call it that) seems rather weak to me--if I'd known better, I would have steered clear.

Wheelan is an amazing prof who is also super sympathetic to students\u2014ended up getting rid of assignments and moving deadlines when he thought that we had too much work (20W was a 9-week term instead of 10). Grading is relatively straightforward in that it is possible to do well; Wheelan is a little picky about writing, being precise, having good ideas, etc. but since he is picky to everyone and the course is curved, it still evens out. Overall, I would recommend the course to people who can handle large amounts of reading (sometimes 80-100 pages per class, 3x a week), the weekly quizzes, a midterm that comes out of nowhere, and people who enjoy policy and want to minor in it. Those who are just doing it for FYF end up disliking the class but still trudging along, those who are taking it just to see ended up dropping, I think.\"",
            "review 2: \"20W with Charles Wheelan: Great class overall. There are a lot of students in the class who are taking it for First-Year Fellows and they try to suck up to the professor a lot, but Wheelan is very good at shutting them down and not letting them speak for hours. The memos are a bit tricky at first but if you figure out what Wheelan likes (concise sentences, clear arguments, interesting formatting that isn't just walls of text) you'll do fine. His office hours are also super helpful so definitely go to those. The lectures are super interesting but there was a large amount of reading for each class so be prepared for that. I recommend taking this class if you're interested in policy or government. Definitely worth it.\"",

Go to his office hours and ask questions and he will give you more than what you expect. He is also a super caring professor and is pretty lenient with extensions. Most quizzes are on Friday unless he says otherwise. For the quizzes, be able to understand the vocab and apply the concepts.\"",
            "review 4: \"20W with Charles Wheelan: This is my favorite class that I have taken at Dartmouth so far. Wheelan is a great lecturer and amazing prof, and I always looked forward to going to class. He is also super open to questions and his office hours (though they can sometimes be hard to get into) are always really helpful. Most of the class is built around readings, weekly quizzes, and memos. The memos can seem daunting at first but if you have any experience with writing about policy (Model UN, debate, etc), they are actually pretty straightforward and everyone gets the hang of them pretty quickly. The fact that he assigns really interesting and relevant topics for the memos make them a lot easier (I wrote about the Dartmouth greek system for one of mine). It is true that A LOT of people just take this class for First-Year Fellows. Given that there is no participation grade, it can be fairly obvious that the people who talk the most are trying to get on Wheelan's good side for FYF, but I will stress that this competitive atmosphere SHOULD NOT stop anyone from taking the class. You will find that a lot of people in this class are really motivated and type-a, but Wheelan does a great job of lessening the feeling of competition. Because people are so motivated, this also means you get a lot of really smart, passionate people who contribute a lot, making the quality of discussion really good. Wheelan is also a super reasonable grader and is always willing to help if you don't do as well as you want to/have questions. The reading can be a lot, especially during the first half of the term. There is one midterm in the class, so leading up to that it is super important that you do all of the readings and take notes on all of them. This can be a lot (even over 100 pages for one class), and it is really time-consuming, but it's essential for the midterm (which was definitely one of the harder tests I've taken at Dartmouth). However, after the midterm, the course winds down a lot and you can get away with not taking extensive notes on the readings and skimming a lot of them (quizzing was less frequent at the end of the term too). The final is a group project which was pretty manageable. Overall, fantastic class. Not a layup, but if you have any interest at all in politics/current events, Wheelan does a great job of making the course super interesting so all the work seems worth it and can be fun.\"",

There is a good amount of reading for the class, but the quizzes based on them often can be predicted or he will just tell the class when they are.

Overall, the class is extremely interesting, although I found that the material after the midterm was more boring. It's helpful to have taken a class on microeconomics but other than that the class is a completely level playing field and you will learn so much about policy analysis. Wheelan brings in several policy experts, activists, or former politicians to speak to the class as well. Other profs or staff affiliated with the Rockefeller Center also come to speak about several programs. Wheelan is a very active, funny, and enjoyable lecturer who asks a lot of questions to keep everyone engaged. I think many people are hesitant about this class because of its rigor and the number of people competing for First-Year Fellows; neither of those should be a deterrent. With Wheelan, the most challenging part of the course is writing concisely and effectively in the memos (he didn't provide examples which was very frustrating because he was not clear with his expectations, but I assume if he teaches it again he can use memos from 20W). Once you have the structure down, the memos are interesting assignments to complete. Commit to the readings (he does semi-random quizzes) and prepare for a relatively tough midterm and you'll be fine. There will be the people applying for Fellows trying to get Wheelan's attention, but he made a point of saying in class that he has no say in who gets it which calmed everyone down.\"",

Professor Wheelan is incredibly interesting and great at keeping our attention with actually educational anecdotes from his own work experiences. The guest speakers he brings in are also amazing and relevant to the topics in class. I learnt so much not just for applicability in this class but for so many others. Professor Wheelan is also super helpful and understanding, often willing to extend deadlines and even ended up scrapping readings and assignments for the entire class when he felt there was too much work for the 9 week term that 20W ended up being. This was the also the only course where I looked forward to most of the readings, as they were super interesting and helpful to understanding the concepts taught in class, and almost always were relevant to our in-class discussions. The only complaint I have with Wheelan is that he assigned his own work for readings a little too much, but the majority of those were still interesting reads so I'm okay with it. Aside from that, some of the other students were clearly just there for the First-Year Fellows program, and tried to kiss ass a bit too much (like guffawing at jokes that only really warranted a chuckle) but Wheelan usually did well in containing them. Overall, an excellent class. It made me decide to minor in Public Policy. However, I have heard different stories from people who took the class in earlier years, when Professor Shaiko was teaching it. I've heard he was a bit dry and less engaging, though still teaching the same kind of interesting and important material. But if Professor Wheelan ever teaches it again, I firmly recommend signing up for it asap.\""
