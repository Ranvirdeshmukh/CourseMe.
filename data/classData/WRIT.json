In-class discussions could have been enjoyable if the readings weren't so awful and if Godley didn't count the exact number of times you talked each class. Her grading is way to harsh, with highs for assignments often being in the mid 80s, and means being even lower. Many assignments that should realistically have been completion were graded such as a plan to revise our papers which had a mean grade of about 84%. The median for the class itself up until the final paper was about a B- for any indication as to her grading habits. Godley herself is a fine prof who wants the best for her students, but in doing so, she sets her expectations far too high, punishes her students with assignments and readings far too difficult, and grades far too harshly for the class to be enjoyable. With other seminars basically handing out 100%s to any paper that meets the word count, Cultures of Self Loathing stands out as one of the worst options for a first year seminar. Most bluntly, this class made me loathe myself.\"",
            "review 2: \"22S with Min Young Godley: Class was amazing!! Min was really kind and insightful. The readings were well paced and very interesting. I loved how they would weave themselves together and build off of each other. Seminars were student lead and encouraged you to ask questions grounded in the readings but you could speak at your own pace and Min would look out for you if you were nervous about speaking. On off days, I could just let her know and she would understand. The class is not the easiest class in the writing seminar cluster but Min grades fairly and gives great feedback if you go to office hours to talk about your work. Some of the grades are weird, like the revision plan but they aren't worth a lot of points so its not tooo big of a deal. But! If you show engagement and effort, you will do fine in the class. Min is very accomodating as well if you are someone who has a high workload. She would even offer me essay extensions proactively if she thought I was being a little overwhelmed. Most importantly, I learned a lot from this class about how to think about language, myself, and writing in general. If you are taking the writing seminar for the A, this is not the class for you. If you want to learn and genuinely engage in your experience of self loathing, this is a great class to do that in!\""

Very casual discussions that were relatively interesting and the professor is pretty funny and caring. 4 papers, first two papers are pretty short (2-3 pages), third paper 3-5 pages, final research paper 8-10 pages. The papers were not very hard to write, but Rockmore's grading standards and feedback were trash imo. I like to think I'm pretty good at writing and I did very well in a difficult WRIT5, but she takes off points for the most stupid things, like a couple \"unnecessary\" adverbs or whatnot. She very much promotes concise and short writing even if it sounds really weird. She gives feedback on the first drafts of papers but even after you fix the things she commented on, some \"new\" problem will magically appear in your final draft that she didn't address in the first draft. TLDR: workload is a layup, grading is not a layup. In some horrible joke of the universe, this seminar is my worst grade ever, even with all the STEM/lab classes I've done.\""

The topic though is super important, and I did come out of it with a better sense of team dynamics.

We had two more major assignments during the second half of the term, one of which was a super extensive research paper written by a team of four. I enjoyed writing a paper as a team, but it was no easy feat and required a lot of work (the final product was 20 pages single spaced). The third and final paper was also a bit of work, it being an independent research paper where you needed to perform three 30 minute interviews and transcribe one of them in addition to writing the entire research report. I definitely put in a ton of time for these last two papers, but if you put in the time you can do well.

Movies like Control Room (the Iraq War from an Arab world prospective), War Room, or footage from 9/11. The big projects were keeping a blog... 2 posts per week on the subject of your choice. Easy enough. Putting together an article for the Writing Department's Newsletter... most group projects were at least partly in the form of a video. An interview usually. A multimedia autobiography... just a few slides in a powerpoint that describe you. A bigger final project... like a 10 minute video on the subject of your choice (apple vs. PC was one of them). And a 3-5 five page analytical/creative essay (not hard at all). Karen was always willing to discuss the projects... discuss life. She's a huge Cleveland sports fan (basketball especially). Lebron James is her favorite. We watched Lebron commercials and dissected them. I learned something interesting... and made a great friend in the prof. If you don't take the damn class, you officially are an idiot.\"",

These traits mean she has a dedicated group of students who would take any class she teaches. That said, this particular class is best suited to those interested in communication and how new media are affecting the way ideas are expressed. By all means visit the class and talk to Karen to see if you're interested, but don't stick around if you're just looking for a distraction from other classes; the work in this class is time and creativity intensive, but it's a lot of fun for an interested student.\""

            "review 2: \"06S with Nancy Crumbine: The class was really frustrating for one reason: the topic. Crumbine is a minister or something, and it shows, she definitely likes to preach. One of her big things is controversial, specific thesises. Only problem was, we had to write every paper with a thesis on the writing process, which is extremely dull. Yeah, the course description said it would be about the writing process. I figured she would talk about the writing process and what we needed to do, but not write every paper on the writing process itself. The final was writing a 6 page paper on the writing process of 2 authors from the course, and almost everyone used at least Annie Dillard or Toni Morrison, so once again, really difficult to be interested in what I was writing. In addition, the professor is definitely unique. It is frustrating because she NEVER puts ink on your papers. Rather, you peer edit them, correct them after a writing assistant goes over them, and then conference with the professor, which means you read it in front of her and tell her what you think is wrong. Her philosophy is interesting, but i think it might be designed to minimize her workload. Continuing on the preacher theme, she loves ot preach about issues. She made manditory a series of documentaries about the struggles of women, a topic she feels strongly about, and really likes to talk about the evil of our current government and about the obvious huge problem that is global warming. In other words, she preaches liberal without even thinking about saying what she thinks might be an opinion. But I am also being hard. She is passionate about what she does. While she has certainly scared everyone in the class, there are good things as well. First, it is easy. I don't think she keeps track of what you do, and the grade is 60% participation. Go to class, participate (she loves to try and facilitate discussions), and spend a lot of time on your oral presentation, and you quite literally can probably not turn in a lot of stuff and still get an A (if she likes you). In addition, all the papers are 1-3 pages until the 6 page final which is not really a research paper, just a paper with secondary sources, even though all freshman seminars are supposed to end in a research paper. Also, she is passionate about what she does. She pushes you to think for yourself, and really her biggest thing is to torque up your writing. No bullshit, no general. She says hundreds of times to make it specific and controversial. And you go over assignments a thousand times, really learning how to make a paper more direct and to the point. Plus she really tries, and succeeds, to let you learn from your classmates a lot if you have an open mind. She says the best resource at Dartmouth is its students and that most profs do not take advantage of that, and I appreciated what she did and agreed.\""

DeShazo was highly efficient in his teaching-- rather than assigning 2 long papers as my winter Writing 5 Professor, Dr. Macantyre did, he assigned 4 two page papers, where he challenged us to answer big questions in very few sentences. Before every lecture, we turned in a one paragraph summary of the key takeaways in our assigned readings. He did this for two reasons, one because he felt writing is improved best by frequent practice, rather than a few long papers, and two because he felt a major skill, applicable in the real world, is to be able to glean and convey the major points and takeaways out of a cloud of information. With so many small writing assignments, it would not be fair to call it light. But everything was for a purpose, he never assigned more than was necessary. Readings were at the right length, around 4-5 hours per week. DeShazo also had us give a 2 minute presentation of our 2 page paper after each 2 page paper was due. I found this particularly useful, as I very rarely had a chance to practice speaking. Overall, I highly recommend DeShazo as a professor!\""

Professor Crumbine is one of the only professors at Dartmouth that is willing to take the time to form real relationships with students that last for years.

            "review 2: \"22F with Nancy Crumbine: Thinking About Education with Professor Nancy Crumbine is arguably the best Writing 5 class you can take for a few reasons. First, there are no graded papers, but you will definitely do well if you put in the work. She removes grades from the writing process so that students can write and grow as writers without being restricted or thinking about grades. However, if you are concerned that you are failing, you can set up office hours with her and she will tell you where you stand. Next, Professor Crumbine ensures you grow as a writer through the iterative process of writing and rewriting and revising. She believes in the power of peer feedbacks, and she forms groups in class where you read each other's writing and give feedback. The only one thing she asks everyone on the first day of class is: \"Commit to making everyone here a better writer.\" The workload for this class is heavy, arguably more than any other Writing 5 class. However, Prof Crumbine knows this, and she gives extensions with grace. She does not deduct your marks if you use extensions, and she is incredibly accommodating of health issues and mental health needs of students. Another thing about Crumbine is that she will go above and beyond for you outside of class. If you have needs at Dartmouth, you can trust that she will advocate for you until your needs are met. She cares deeply about her students and goes far and wide for them. The texts read in class can sometimes feel denser than Humanities 1 and 2 classes, but they change how you think about education, especially Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. If you want a layup, this class is not for you. If you want to grow as a writer, want to be with an incredibly intelligent and engaging Professor, want to read tough texts and ask tough questions, want to bond with your classmates over shared projects, then take this class. It may be tough, but it is amazing, rewarding, and guarantees you at least an A- if you put in the work (and many times, an A).\"",

That might be a turn-off for some people, but she's easily contactable if you're ever worried about how you're doing in the class\u2014she makes it a point to reach out if she feels you need help, too. She's also incredibly accommodating, and has a no-questions-asked policy for extensions. For your own sake, though, keep up with the writing work./ The readings were pretty varied, and you watch three movies. You might be confused for the first few weeks about how the readings tie into each other or the course in general, but it'll make sense with time. You don't have to read everything too deeply (though I recommend reading The Catcher in the Rye enough that you can recall most details), but just make sure you have something to say about every text you read\u2014tying them into previous texts/your personal experiences works great./ Most importantly, come into this class with a good sense of humour and you'll have a great time.

I mean, A LOT. Crumbine believes in a peer-based feedback system, where there are both class writing review sessions and smaller peer group meetings to improve writing. She will make your peers dig deep in tiny bits of your one-page assignment, and you will sometimes have to rewrite the whole thing; I have seen this happen multiple times. She is of the most deliberate teachers I have ever seen when it comes to selecting course readings, which was one of the highlights of this course. She remembers nearly every detail about the assigned readings, and you will be amazed when she opens the floor to discussions on stuff you have never realized before. As the course progresses, you will see how every text ties in multiple ways, which introduces lots of great opportunities to explore in your writing assignments. Crumbine is always there for her students, whether it is one-on-one meetings or group conferences, and she achieves to create a close-knit classroom environment. She was open to extension requests, a consequence of intentionally pushing students further than the other sections. She truly cares about her work, which I appreciated a lot.

I was not disappointed with my decision. Prof. Crumbine is witty and facilitates class discussions well (almost forcibly, but I liked this because Zoom silence is annoying). Reading Catcher in the Rye thoroughly is super important for this class and I would advise reading the other readings (ex. Pedagogy of the Oppressed) she assigns as well, as they all can be used in upcoming assignments. But, don't feel like you have to get every little thing you read in these other readings. She helped me become a more concise writer and helped a lot with using the active voice. I also became a lot better at revising papers.

If you are a procrastinator like myself who is interested only in if the class is a layup, you probably shouldn't take this course. The iterative process of rewriting papers while simultaneously writing other papers can be a bit of a nightmare if you leave everything until the last minute. If rewriting a one-page paper 8 or 9 times doesn't appeal to you, don't take this course, as you will be doing so. If you enjoy creativity in your sentence structures, don't take this course; you will NEVER be allowed to use any of the to be verbs, such as is, were, was, etc. If being scolded for using the words like, you know, I mean, and other verbal tics sounds absolutely dreadful, don't take this course. If you have a strong work ethic, a willingness to participate in discussions and handle criticism, a desire to improve your writing, and/or a love of speaking with an intelligent professor after class (about anything!), perhaps this is the class for you. Crumbine is blunt during class, so a bit of a tough skin is required. However, this bluntness very effectively works out the kinks in your writing and speech that you may not have noticed. Outside of class, Crumbine truly is a kind and considerate old lady who will always give you extensions if you need them (midterms, mental health, etc.). If you just want to talk politics with her, go for it\u2014I'm writing this review just after a 15 minute conversation I had with her about the election.

She is so passionate about the material and tries to get us to be just as engaged. I am a much better writer now than I was before. You do a lot of drafts and revising. As long as you stay on top of the assignments, this class is very manageable and not too stressful. Because of the nature of the topic, you get pretty personal with some of your writing.

I enjoyed the readings (with the exception of Pedagogy) and felt they were relevant to education in an abstract sense. Other reviews here have expressed confusion over going from somewhat creative pieces to academic essays, and while I agree that the change is a little jarring, I still think all of the \"rules for good writing\" that she repeats to us apply for every assignment. We \"show, not tell\" whether we are working on a memoir or a research paper. Don't let the other reviews scare you.

            "review 12: \"19F with Nancy Crumbine: Some will say Professor Crumbine exudes \"tough love,\" \"blunt honesty,\" \"conviction,\" \"wit,\" and \"wisdom.\" Others interpret these same behaviors as meanness, rudeness, dogmatism, arrogance, and condescension. I must say I fall in the latter camp. For one thing, Professor Crumbine has a very narrow view of what constitutes \"good writing,\" and this perspective is pulled from a simplistic set of writing dogmas such as \"show don't tell\" and \"don't use any 'to be' verbs.\" Yes, to a certain extent these rules are applicable to a particular type of writing\u2014especially the short expository writing we do in class via a \"colleague introduction\"\u2014but in academic writing, the need for readability renders some of these rules unnecessary (for instance, how, and WHY, would one avoid \"to be\" verbs in scholarly writing?). To her credit, her emphasis on concision in writing is a point that transcends genres, since it is true that clarity of thought is reflected in clarity of language, and that clear language also feeds clear thinking. Her method of having us write a one-page, double-spaced paper (the \"colleague introduction,\" which wasn't really an introduction of a peer at all but rather a description of a revealing scene in their life) was something I wholly endorsed, since I agree that perfecting something short and simple is the key to learning artistic mastery of any discipline (writing, painting, music, etc.). Aside from the fact that Crumbine assigned way too many small assignments due on the same date, and that her critiques themselves were based on narrow stylistic biases, the methodology BEHIND her assignments was sound enough. That being said, my overall impression of Crumbine's class was a negative one due to Crumbine's self-importance, impoliteness, and patronizing attitude, all of which contributed to a class atmosphere in which people were afraid to share their opinions, make mistakes, and admit uncertainty. For instance, Crumbine possesses this tired snobbery that compels her to badger students for their use of filler words or qualifiers such as \"kinda\" and \"personally, I . . .\" In fact, she will interrupt students mid-sentence to berate them for their use of one of these words or phrases. This is asinine. Filler words are used by speakers of every language for several reasons: to express uncertainty (aka humility), to gather their thoughts, and to indicate approximations (e.g. \"it's sort of cold outside\"). Yes, overusing filler words can lead to equivocation or ambiguity, but compulsively calling people out for using them is pretentious and rude, and I'd suggest Crumbine take a more balanced and curious approach to language rather than pouncing on people for violating her narrow linguistic conventions that she pulled out of one particular style guide. This critique gets at a broader problem I had with Crumbine, and that was her intellectual arrogance. While I had another professor this term who would listen to and seriously consider students' input (psst\u2014there are actually some bright students here with novel and well-reasoned ideas!), I can't say Crumbine extended the same courtesy to her students. She enjoyed hearing what you had to say if you agreed with her, but that means nothing. Everyone enjoys that. She is so fixed in her ideas about writing, teaching, and whatever other topics she randomly introduces in class (such as climate change\u2014as if I registered for this course to hear my professor's recycled moralizing about the planet), that there is no \"free\" discussion in her classroom. For example, in the second class, I pushed back against one of Crumbine's arbitrary \"rules\" (the one about \"to be\" verbs) and she responded frankly: \"What I'm NOT going to do is debate.\" What? Is this college or bootcamp? At least she was honest about her stubbornness and narrow-mindedness. It was just ironic that we later read works about \"engaging in dialogue\" as a form of pedagogy, since Crumbine clearly didn't take such writings to heart. Because of this attitude, by several weeks in students were too afraid and tired of being berated that they only timidly say things they hope Crumbine will approve of, often in the form of crude mantras such as \"show don't tell.\" That's not learning. That's regurgitating bullshit uttered by one arrogant professor in an attempt to appease them. If you don't want to feel perpetually anxious in class, to be subject to unmerited rude remarks, to have your writing critiqued in a narrow and dogmatic way without being given a chance to defend yourself, to be swamped with numerous assignments all due simultaneously, to be patronized for your supposed ignorance (she once quipped that \"Most Americans have no idea what's going on in the rest of the world,\" before going on to mispronounce Erdo\u011fan's name), and to entertain her self-important platitudes (\"life lessons\"), then skip this class. I am disappointed to conclude that the scholarly inquisitiveness, the intellectual humility, and the respect for others' ideas that I hoped to find in my professors was, for the most part, absent from Crumbine. Do yourself a huge favor and find instead a professor who is knowledgable and intelligent, but also polite, respectful, humble, and open-minded. You'll learn more when you're comfortable and free to openly discuss your ideas\u2014including ones the professor might disagree with\u2014with your classmates and professor. Swallowing the dogmas and enduring the belittlement of any professor is a waste of time, and you deserve better than that out of your education.\"",

These types of students wrote some of the bad reviews on here. Professor Crumbine obviously understands that coming into the class, some people are better writers than others. Yet if you allow her to, she will teach you that we all have something to learn from one another. This class is work, but it would be impossible for this class to be as transformational as it is without writing the amount we do. For students whose main priority is not the betterment of their writing, then they will complain as to how much work the class is because they do not understand nor care that this work is necessary to improve their writing. These types of students wrote the rest of the bad reviews on here. Aside from the writing, the discussions we had in class were so interesting and complex. Professor Crumbine encouraged us to tie the texts to current events and our personal life, making the discussions even more insightful. Yet most importantly, Professor Crumbine is a very caring person. She will work with your schedule to set up a time to meet and will listen to what you have to say, whether it is related to the course or not. I once came up to her after class to set up a time to see her in her office and she told me to email her. I never got around to emailing her partially because I was so busy and because I was a little intimated about speaking with her alone in her office. I thought she would forget that I even asked but she ended up emailing me herself and asking if I still wanted to speak with her. She then drove to campus on a Sunday night just to met with me. She is really passionate about what she does, what she teaches, and who she teaches. It is a true misfortune for those who took her course and were not able to realize that. I really hope that their comments do not cause you to miss the amazing opportunity that is this class.\"",

HOWEVER THAT WAS FAR FROM THE CASE. Professor Crumbine was such a nice and caring individual! She was a little rough on the grading and the amount of work she gave the class from week 3 to week 7, but it was all worth it in my opinion. The readings are genuinely mind boggling and the discussions in class are extremely deep. My writing improved so much within the first few weeks because she focuses on a lot of guidelines other teachers don't teach. She was a wonderful professor and you definitely get back what you put in. I highly recommend!\"",

If you don't like having pretentious snobs who will critique your writing without giving you clear reasons why, use big phrases to sound smart, or discuss random crap unrelated to the topic at hand or presentation at hand, don't waste your time on this course.

The class goes from drafting a page-long memoir of a peer for about 6 weeks, or a total of 10 drafts to argumentative writing about texts \"relating to education\". Switching from creative writing to academic confuses many of the peers as most of her \"rules to good writing\" no longer apply. Crumbine stresses on getting rid of speech ticks such as \"sorry\", \"like\", and \"I was going to say.\" She dissects your writing during class going sentence by sentence and identifies the unnecessary details or flaws. While the in-class revision can be a bit cruel, you learn more from your peer's input rather than from Crumbine. Expect to not know your grade or feedback on the final draft as she does not hand that back to you. All you do in this class is revise, which may seem repetitive to some. As for workload, a rewrite of an essay is expected every class, along with a \"reading journal\" on Tuesdays and a poem on Thursdays. Sometimes, these assignments pile up and you have about several rewrites due on one class period. Classwork is not difficult but if it is a challenge to often relate the assignments to the theme of the class as the prompts are always ambiguous.\"",
            "review 18: \"18F with Nancy Crumbine: Professor Nancy Crumbine is a freakin blessing. The course was challenging, but for a good reason: my writing improved IMMENSELY and found myself actually thinking critically. Professor Crumbine might come across as \"too hardcore,\" but she is honestly one of the most kindhearted, caring, sharp, and interesting faculty members at Dartmouth. I am so happy that I took her course and got to know such an amazing person. You will do well if you really do put in 100% of your effort into the assignments, actually do the reading, and contribute actively & RESPECTFULLY during discussions. For anyone that is hesitating, please take my advice and sign up for Professor Crumbine's Writing 5 class. There were times in the middle of the quarter when I thought to myself, \"Oh my gosh, this is so difficult,\" but in hindsight, I cannot be more thankful to my past self for taking a leap of faith. I know you have no reason to listen to some random anonymous person's advice online, but trust me on this.\"",
            "review 19: \"18F with Nancy Crumbine: Professor Crumbine was the highlight of my fall term because she taught me how to write and encouraged me to think in ways I had not before. Yes, her style is blunt and at times may seem mean. You will revise your work line-by-line in front of the whole class, in peer groups, and in small conferences with Crumbine and 1-2 other students. You will revise a piece 6 or 7 times before submitting, and you will not get a single piece of graded writing back. But you will learn how to write. If the class had to be summed up in one word it would be \"process.\" That means that Crumbine does not look at your writing on an objective scale and dismiss it as \"bad,\" but looks for your ability to think carefully and self-critically and engage in a constructive process of revision; it also means she doesn't take BS or excuses. At the same time, it means anyone who puts in work gets an A, and the 18F median was an A. Still, the course is a significant amount of work, but the writing assignments are extremely open-ended and encourage creativity as much as good craft. Overall, the course rewards effort and participation; if you don't show a good-faith effort to //want// to improve your writing, Crumbine will dislike you, and the course will be difficult. On the other hand, if you bring a good attitude and a willingness to work, you will thrive in this class. I think some rumor went around about Crumbine being utterly brutal and ridiculous because many 21s wince when they hear Crumbine's name and her course was one of the few unfilled days into add/drop both 18F and 19W. No, she didn't throw any papers out the window in my class, and she didn't raise her voice once. I'm here to tell you that if you are a hard worker and care about your writing getting better, don't trust the reviews\u2014take this class. Crumbine will make your time worth it.\"",

She's actually pretty understanding, and makes it clear that she wants you to get better. She is terrifying to talk to one on one, but she honestly just wants you to do well. You edit everyone's paper on the board, sentence by sentence. It's not anonymous. I thought that was going to be awful, but honestly everyone goes through it together and no one judges, it's really not that bad. And your writing get's sooooo much better. She has some weird writing quirks, like you can't use \"to be\" verbs, or any \"however\" or \"therefore\" type words, which takes a while to get used to. It's definitely a lot of reading and A LOT of writing, but you also learn a ton!\"",

            "review 22: \"18F with Nancy Crumbine: Crumbine, though she can come across as harsh and insensitive, truly blew my expectations for a first-year writing course. I have never been challenged by a writing course, but I can say with confidence that because of the rigor of Crumbine's course, I am a much better writer. The class revolves around revision -- self, peer, and professor revision. After a full class + Crumbine review, I revised the first assignment (1-page narration) 8 times. But after reading my first draft after 9 week, I found the difference between the 2 drafts to be shocking. Crumbine brilliantly used peer review as a vessel for learning. Each 4-person group met about once a week to review each others' work, and, though a time-consuming process, I learned how to give and receive constructive criticism, apply feedback to my work, and (most valuably) how to effectively edit my own papers. Lastly, she took an hour at a time to meet with 3 students in which she would guide revision and add her own feedback as well. Conferences usually took place 1-2 week after the first draft, and surprisingly, the time Crumbine planned between writing and revision made the conferences extremely effective. Crumbine, though a very caring professor, is intense. She kept tallies of instances where students would use \"like,\" \"you know,\" \"um,\" etc. She hates to-be verbs and threatens to throw papers out the window. She occasionally scolds students for keeping their hands up with questions, and, very rarely, she will make you cry. The workload is also absurd and therefore extremely time consuming. And the theme of education doesn't really work in the class. I found some of my closest friends in Nancy's class tho bc nothing brings people together like suffering. 7.5/10 would recommend.\"",
            "review 23: \"18F with Nancy Crumbine: OK so this was my situation - I was placed into Writing 2/3 but having taken both AP Englishes I thought this class would be a simple requirement class I wouldn't have to stress about. However, this class isn't just reading and writing and essays. It's a lot of tedious revisions and drafts and nitpicking, BUT IT WORKS. Crumbine will give you a new assignment, reading, paper to write or packet/book to read every class and still expect you to work/redraft previous assignments, AND THEY WILL OVERLAP. She will circle the smallest mistakes with big circles because there is no room for passive voice or unnecessary words/sentences in her class. You will learn the basics of good writing in this class and you will learn how to do them right through examples, readings, and in-class revisions. You go from single to multiple paged assignments very slowly because, as she will teach you, the first rule of good writing is concision. Crumbine will make you speak with confidence and catch every flaw in every word you speak or write - the way she does this, yes, maybe rude and just flat out obnoxious sometimes but I think she has that attitude for a reason: because when you're taught to have a defensive tone in your arguments, it makes the argument stronger. First few assignments I was super worried I wasn't prepared for this class but Crumbine really opens herself to conference and discuss ways to improve. She is also very VERY understanding that as incoming freshman, our classes, especially the required English one that no one really wants to take, are super stressful and is open to talking about self-management and the college transition because deep down she cares about her students. You just HAVE to make that connection. When you show your efforts and your progress, you will catch her attention and she will make sure you know your improvements. This will obviously help out your grade, which by the way you are not updated on unless failing. Yes, sometimes she laughs at what we wrote and made us cry - which is never healthy -, but sometimes you write something pretty bad and you need to be humiliated to write something better. I don't regret taking this class, as there was a lot of passion, openness, and sophisticated discussion among everyone in the class and the readings were super interested and, as you will come to see, beautifully interconnected and related in ideas. I truly became a better writer in this class, despite it seeming to be a lot less work that a lot of the other Writing 5's this term. I'm also pretty sure I got an A, as the medium is pretty high. Don't let other reviews scare you away. TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. IT REALLY ISN'T BAD.\"",

This class was not my first choice, but I am extremely happy fate placed me into it. By now, I'm sure if you're coming to Dartmouth you've had the renowned, \"difficult\" teacher and probably heard only negative things, but once you gave them a try, it was really beneficial. If not, I'm sorry you haven't had that experience, it's a quite interesting one. I digress, the point is Professor Crumbine gives a lot of work, but its not for no reason. Her expectations serve as help for you to transition smoothly to understand Dartmouth's expectations in just 10 weeks. Throughout the course, you may find rough nights, but no fears, for Professors are people you can talk to and Professor Crumbine makes that very clear from the start of the course. She acknowledges that you are transitioning and that for some it goes smoother than others. She's also a very humorous individual who truly makes the hard-work of the class lighter. Towards the end of term, when my writing in other classes sped up, I felt better equipped to write a proper essay and I really started understanding the things she nagged on in class. Thanks to Professor Crumbine, I genuinely was able to be proud of my work in other classes. In addition, just to clear the review about \"throwing the paper out the window,\" it was a 1 page paper and the person turned in 2 after being told clear directions. I hope that clarifies what looks like a just rude and spiteful situation. Overall, I think what has been written in the past is particularly unfair and I would like to serve as that small glimmer of hope for any incoming freshmen or current '22s worried about her class.\"",

The in-class peer reviews can be tough when your paper is up, but a retrospective look at each iteration of the same paper you work on over the course of the term will show an immense improvement in your writing. At first impression, Crumbine may seem like a callous, critical professor. Get to know her, and you will find she is both compassionate and wants to teach how to write well. She understands that Dartmouth students start their time here on different footing (as to writing ability) and the grade she gives reflects your respective refinement. Crumbine stands among Dartmouth's best.\"",

I know I felt that way a few times during the term. But I am incredibly happy I took this class, and I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about improving his/her writing and oral skills. You will be doing a lot of reading in this class, writing several short papers, (many of which are creative and not your usual analytic papers) rewriting your papers many times, doing an oral presentation, keeping up with a journal, looking at poetry, and maybe a theater project (which was a new assignment for this term and was incredibly time consuming but fulfilling). Crumbine is serious about whipping your writing skills into shape. You will be spending a good bit of time with this course. Crumbine herself might seem like a stickler and thick-skinned, but she is actually a very caring lady who really wants to get to know her students personally. She wants to see you excel. Don't let her reputation dissuade you from taking this course. Honestly, even though I had to work my ass off, I've never had so much fun in a class. Crumbine really brings the best out of you and something hilarious happens every class. She isn't the mean old bat a lot of people make her out to be. Rewriting is Crumbine's thing. You're not expected to come in with a stellar first draft. You are expected to work several versions of the paper and end with a polished finished product. The papers you are assigned cover a nice, broad range. You do an intro of a classmate, a memoir, a definition paper, an argument paper, and a final paper. None of the papers are more than 2 pages long except the final which is 4-5. But don't let the length fool you. You will be writing and rewriting A LOT. A 1 page paper is supposed to be 10 pages polished down to 1, and Crumbine will drill you into learning how to do that. She has high standards and a great paper takes a lot of effort, certainly a lot more than what you would expect from just 1 page of work. One of the great things is that you and your classmates all struggle together, especially in the beginning, but you all start getting the hang of things as the term progresses. Looking back, it was an enjoyable class. If you do the theater project, expect another challenge. You write a 15 page script with a group that presents an argument between characters you have studied. It really was a mental marathon to write it and perform it, but it was well worth it. Definitely take this course if you want to get out of Dartmouth all that you possibly can. I came to a place like Dartmouth for professors like Crumbine. Make the most of your time here.

She's got good instincts as to how you're doing in class and how much you're trying, and even though she's tough, her grading is accurate. The class depends on you being organized and keeping up with the work, although she ended up not collecting our poetry journals and free-written thoughts about the class, which were regular work we were supposed to be doing. (This doesn't mean she won't collect them every year, things just got pretty hectic.)

Crumbine is kind of intimidating at first--she has a really specific way of doing everything and does not like deviation. She criticizes and edits your writing extensively if you share it in class (i.e. in front of the class too...she'll put your work up on the overhead projector). She's also really big on oral presentations: there's one in the middle of the term and one longer one at the end as well as one final paper and an annotated bibliography. But, as psycho as Crumbine is, she definitely grows on you. You can tell she cares about her students and the progress that you make as an individual writer. Her input really helps your writing, although (in my case) it almost made me less independent as a writer because I grew to rely so strongly on other people's feedback in the extensive editing process she makes you go through.

She will not tell you what you SHOULD think, but instead will mediate conversations where students will debate controversial topics and discovery, independently, what their stance is. If you have a chance, google her and read some of her work. A must read is \"On silence\". You should REALLY try to take a course with Crumbine.

            "review 48: \"07F with Nancy Crumbine: The facts about this course: - the prof doesn't give you feedback on your papers apart from the conferences towards the end of the term: she encourages peer reviews instead - you attain close to no theoretical background of what's expected in academic writing: the prof spends the first half of the term going over papers in class, mostly making them more concise, focused, and emphasizing the importance of a good thesis: she tells you what you shouldn't do, but she doesn't say what you should do instead - the second half of the term is spent giving oral presentations. yes, these have nothing to do with writing, but she believes oral skills are equally important - why call this writing 5, then? - you will need to keep a journal and attend three lectures outside of class: again, not much direct connection with writing, plus I don't see why a prof should pressurize students to attend things that are otherwise not compulsory - you don't receive a single grade on your papers, until your final course grade - 50% of the grade is based on class participation, ie the prof can give you whatever she feels like giving you - you will have assigned readings, but won't discuss them in class: you read for the sake of it - you will write a LOT, mostly on topics of your own choice, which is not that helpful: in your future academic career you will not choose your own topics all the time. if you still feel like taking this course, go for it. i learnt quite a bit and my writing improved quite a bit despite all that I have just said: Nancy Crumbine is experienced and knows what she talks about, plus she does care about her students. Her methods, however, are quite ineffective in terms of writing itself, and sometimes annyoing as she spends time on things unrelated to the course. the grading is really annoying also, and the lack of feedback probably the worst aspect of this course. overall, i really regret taking it and hope you don't make the same mistake.\"",

She is energetic, enthusiastic, demands perfection and really shows during class that she cares about what she is talking about and about improving our writing. That being said, she can be very very grumpy, and never gives grades (I have no idea whether I got an A or a C). Our workshops consisted of meeting in her office and her telling us she had not marked up our papers because she thought it was most effective for us to critique them ourselves. This seemed a little strange, because she claims we had to produce final copies of papers and then comes back at us and wants us to edit them again in front of her. I did put a lot of effort into my papers, but felt like I didn't always get great help from her end. She also is really unclear with deadlines and then gets really upset when we were really unsure of deadlines. Her TA, on the otherhand, wrote a book on every paper, more input than I thought was possible. The assignments themselves were not so bad. Only really short papers. She really hammered us on getting good thesises. And she requires a lot of readings, but looking back you really didn't have to read any of them except Slaughterhouse-Five, which is a great read that everyone should have read anyways.

Here's what I have to say... Crumbine is a bull. She is a tough, opinionated lady who pushes her students hard and is picky about things like using paper clips vs staples. She is also at times slightly disorganized and, due to the constant re-writing of papers that takes place in the class, things can get messy with handing in different drafts of different assignments. THAT BEING SAID, i learned a LOT this fall in her class. You will cringe at the word \"thesis\" by the end because Crumbine is all about refining your thesis and making you a more concise writer. We had the opportunity to write some cool papers like a memoir, interview piece, and argument papers on topics of our choosing. I love writing so this wasn't a problem for me, but be prepared to spend lots of time writing and refining your work. Here's the real key: if you go into this class with a lighthearted approach and ready for the sometimes amusing antics of Crumbine, you will enjoy yourself. The class had a great time being there because despite being a \"bull\" she really does care about her students. On good days, she would joke with us, and she is truly an interesting and very entertaining woman. In summary, if you take this class, you will never forget Nancy Crumbine- you are guaranteed to want to kill her a few times during the term, but if you get your work done and play according to her rules you'll gain her respect and find its a pretty good class overall.

Prof. Rockmore goes the extra mile to be available for office hours and feedback (she helped me revise my draft on a Saturday morning before the sun came up). She even brought us bagels on the last day of class. It wouldn't be a good class without a little challenge. I would take again!\"",

If you are interested in law, current events, or the Constitution, the content of the course will be appealing and engaging. However, in my opinion, this course was ruined by Rockmore herself. The only \"style\" of writing she gives good grades for is that which is extremely simplistic to the point where it sounds idiotic, incoherent, and more like a list of bullet points. I think she is actually a really sweet woman but the way she handled teaching writing in one-on-one situations was just unbelievably frustrating. I think it's partly because she is so awkward that she cannot voice her true opinions or give genuinely helpful advice or direction. She will write you really nice comments here and there in your essays and then slap you with a B+. Then, when you meet with her to ask where that grade came from she can barely find any reasons, or (this happened to me) she finds mistakes in her grading and has to re-grade your paper after. I continuously dreaded our consultations because they always felt painfully awkward. I would walk away each time feeling like I was a terrible writer\u2014even though I've always been told I'm a good writer and I want to pursue a career in writing. Generally, the fact that she couldn't back up her own grading system and gave terrible grades for no good reason, and was 1111000% more nit-picky than any other writing 5 prof, I wouldn't recommend this course.\"",

It was a great course which covered many interesting topics - mainly in political philosophy, but we ended up doing very little material related to the course topic itself. This actually ended up being great, since she allows a lot of flexibility with paper titles, particularly the last two. Take her class if you are interested in law and philosophy. She grades fairly, although I would say a little more harshly than most writing 5 classes. The median was an A- for this class. She marks essays on a rubric out of 22 points, but her grade assignments are sometimes a bit arbitrary - a 21/22 can often be an A- for that paper, and a 20/22 can be a B+. She gives very helpful feedback after the first draft of any paper, and you usually have more than a week to amend the final draft. There are 4 papers over the course of the team - about 4 pages for each. Reading takes a couple of hours a week - workload is very reasonable. Would 100% recommend the class, but definitely not a easy layup like some of the other WRIT 5 classes out there.\"",

Essay scores are given out as letter grades and I think the majority of students get either A or A-. Professor Rockmore schedules the first draft deadline approximately two weeks before the final draft deadline and gives out graded rubric along with the comments. Then she would schedule one on one office hour with everyone in class approximately a week before the final draft deadline. This system has been extremely helpful for me as I am terrible with time management. In terms of the readings, the workload wasn't really stressful for me. Assigned readings were reasonable and very engaging. You can expect about 6-15 pg of reading per class. The overall class atmosphere is very chill. Professor would casually take us out and have a class on the grass when the weather is good. Once we had a group dance class with a professional instructor to investigate hive psychology, which was part of our reading. She is also very generous about giving extensions.\"",

She has a law background and wants short, simple, punchy, concise, clear, organized writing (don't do what I just did). She uses a great writing guidebook that helped my writing immensely. Rockmore was also very helpful with writing conferences, and I would recommend that you go to her because she will tell you exactly what you need to fix. In terms of subject matter, this course fell flat at times. The first few weeks explored studies on happiness factors, but then the middle of the course tried to connect happiness with the law through utilitarianism, which wasn't properly explored, and abortion, LGBTQ rights, etc., which weren't presented clearly. For example, my third paper was about Catholic influence on abortion, which felt far removed from the course title. I'll also say that the end of the course got a little busy, as you finish up paper #3 at the same time as you have to grind on your research paper.

As long as you stay semi- on top of the workload it is very doable. In the beginning there were short readings for most classes with discussion in class. For the final third (ish) of the term there is lots of peer and small group conferencing so you don't actually go to class most days, just have to submit pieces of writing to get feedback on.

Start the final paper early. It can be daunting but honestly it's not; you choose the topic, and write summaries of the topic based on whatever your argument is. Prof Rockmore is funny and nice.

The \"Happiness and the Law\" focus seemed interesting, which is why I opted to take the course, but it ended up being altogether different from what I expected. The first half of the course was mostly dedicated to the readings of Richard Layard, who found that happiness hadn't been increasing post-WW2, but the question of \"Why\" was never really addressed. Then, the course shifted to examining Utilitarian philosophers like Bentham and Mill, and looking at the applications of Utilitarianism in American law, but only as it related to social issues decided on by the Supreme Court, such as Obergefell, Lawrence v. Texas, and Roe v. Wade. The course has a definite \"legal\" focus, but it is more about Utilitarianism and Social Justice, which I enjoyed but did not expect encountering in the class.

I liked the readings (court cases, hate crimes, etc) as I have been interested hate crimes (as a racial minority) and court decisions (I enjoyed how the court reached the decision....a fascinating part!). Yet, at the last part of the class the reading became very pointless. Now, onto criticism. As most people say, she grades papers arbitrarily. She doesn't leave many comments. Just questions or short comments which don't \"guide\" students to how to structure the paragraph, etc. In that respect the professor completely evaded the objective of Writing 5. You take her advice and then she will write another kind of criticism that didn't come up in the first draft. Yes, you follow her advice and your final draft gets an apparently lower grade than the first draft. How good is that? Also, along the same line, she just allows students to revise only once, which doesn't certainly contribute to improve student's writing skills. The second criticism is her excessive focus on some grammatical/stylistic things. More often than not she lectures on grammar in the second half of the class...mostly pointless stuff. She particularly focuses on nominalisation. It seems like I have heard her saying \"nominalisation is not good\" million times. She goes over a single stylistic error to death in her lectures on grammar/style. Basically I wasted my time during the grammar lectures. The grammar/style book she chose wasn't helpful at all either. My third criticism (along the line of the second criticism) is the peer editing procedure since it was a waste of time. We look at one's paper and suggest how to make it into a better paper. As I mentioned above this class was about writing in the way your professor wants. The peer editing time was really discussing how to write in the way the professor wants. So why wasting time? In conclusion, while she was not bad at leading discussions and chose interesting readings, there are more negative aspects than positive aspects, namely arbitrary grades, inefficient use of lecture time, and, if it pleases you, the failure to get over the limitation of most writing seminars. Overall I wouldn't recommend taking this class. Medium-high quality discussions can't compensate valuable feedbacks for drafts and efficient use of lecture time.\"",

I was horrified going in (it was my third choice because of its time-slot), but it really was a pretty decent class. Nothing earth shattering going on here, but Rockmore is effective at guiding lecture and tends to add intelligent commentary to already fairly interesting material. A disclaimer, though: this is not really a writing course. There are not a ton of assignments, no writing workshops, etc. There are a few things that kind of approach a writing workshop from time to time, but definitely not what you would expect of a writing class. Given that Rockmore is a JD and not an expert in most of the things we discuss, she takes on the role of casual observer more often than professor. Also, the one true thing of prior comments is that the papers are graded very, very arbitrarily - not so much based on writing effectiveness but on how closely you meet her narrow interpretation of what your argument should be.\"",

            "review 2: \"11F with Barbara Kreiger: From what I've heard, compared to a lot of Writing 5s, this one is not that much work. There were about 5 papers, none of which were that long. No final, no mid-term. A lot of the papers were personal writing, which I think is easier. There were lots of opportunity for re-writing/revising (some required, some not). I'm not sure how much my writing really improved, but it was nice to get a second stab at the papers. She's overall a moderate fair grader-just be prepared to always get some type of B on your paper. She does give you lots of good feedback though. I personally liked Kreiger, though some people found her a little boring and old-fashioned in her opinions. She's overall nice and pretty easy to talk to. The topic (American Memoirs) means that this class feels like a pretty typical discussion-based English class, often involving lots of close analysis. One great thing, I think, was that instead of reading a couple memoirs, we read excerpts from maybe 15 different memoirs over the course of the term, some well-known, others not. Almost all of them were interesting to read and great pieces of writing. This format meant we got to be exposed to wide variety of styles and stories. We also workshopped 1-3 papers a week, meaning the whole class would read and discuss someone's paper (their name was taken off it). It's helpful to hear your paper workshopped (not everyone's gets workshopped, but no one gets workshopped twice, and she'll always ask your permission before putting your paper up for discussion), but what's more helpful, I think, is discussing the strengths and weakness of your peer's works. Kreiger is very available to meet outside of class, though I don't know how much my meetings with here really helped me. But I think just going in and showing an effort is good, and can't hurt your grade. She makes you go in to meet with her about your first paper, which I think is good. Towards the end of the class the discussions and workshops got a bit boring and repetitive, but overall I thought this class was interesting and a great chance to do a lot of writing. Just FYI, this class is NOT about writing your own memoir, though you do have some chances to do personal writing, it's mostly about analyzing other people's memoirs.

Prof. Kreiger, a very intelligent and insightful professor, took a \"laid-back\" role in the classroom, which helped to contribute to the free-flowing ideas and discussions of the class. Prof. Kreiger allowed each student to creatively modify each paper to suit his or her own interests. Therefore, each student could mold the class to focus upon what each wanted to focus upon. I believe that a reading regiment which lacks a very intensive nature should be encouraged throughout all writing classes because, supplemented by the positive teaching style of Prof. Kreiger, it allowed for each student to develop as a writer.

            "review 1: \"12F with Wendy Piper: Course: The reading for the class was pretty light. The first half material was a little dry, but we finished with The Help, which was extremely enjoyable. Every class was basically discussion based unless we had a peer review. Professor: Piper was a little scatterbrained at times, but I enjoyed her high energy. Definitely woke me up every morning. She tends to pick favorites, but as long as you actively participate in class discussions, you'll be on her good side. Workload: We only had three \"big\" papers (4-6 pages) that determined our grade. In this manner, the workload was very light. The amount of reading was anywhere from 15-100 pages a class, and greatly varied throughout the term. Piper favors a very succinct and \"to the point\" writing style, so if you followed her suggestions, she was a fair grader.\"",
            "review 2: \"11F with Wendy Piper: Seriously, this was an awful awful class. Crumbine assigned the most inordinate amount of work and was mean. She looked at every small mistake as though it were some awful occurrence and never cut students a break. I was terrified of her.\"",

            "review 4: \"09W with Wendy Piper: the course itself was pretty easy, and the books were interesting, as were discussions. however, essay topics were very 8th grade, and i don't feel that my writing improved significantly. also, piper is brutal. not as far as grading, but just personality-wise-you do NOT want to get on her bad side.\"",
            "review 5: \"09W with Wendy Piper: Professor Piper is unresponsive to the students during class, and quite frequently lashes out at a student (high school style.) The assignments are easy and the papers are not long, but it is unpleasant to sit in a 65 minute class with Wendy Piper more than once in one's life.\"",
            "review 6: \"09F with Wendy Piper: I read so many good reviews and heard so many good references that I decided to take the class. The professor kept of stressing how our writing style itself must change to be less verbose and more terse, and would grade papers down for poor style. She repeated several times, however, that she is not an editor and never offered specific feedback on how to fix our style. She offered examples of good papers, but she just expected us to copy their style instead of working with us to help us individually. In terms of general paper topics she was a lot easier on the grading if paper topics were ones that she liked. It helped me to come in regularly and talk to her during office hours so that I would write exactly what she would agree with. Also, she chose favorites in the class and called on them much more often during class discussions. IIn my opinion, she was biased towards guys as her favorites. She also blatantly disliked some people in the class, which made everyone feel uneasy. Also, expecting us to read a 545 page book in about 2-3 weeks was a bit tough (especially since we had to write 2 essays at the same time) Think twice about taking the class. It is possible to get a good grade, but you will have to do a lot of work for it, especially in terms of doing what pleases her.\"",
            "review 7: \"09F with Wendy Piper: My writing has improved somewhat over the course of the term. I would attribute most of that improvement to 'Style' though. Piper emphasizes in class that she is not an editor, yet she spends a lot of time going over wording. She takes off points for poorly constructed arguments in our papers, which is fine, but she didn't work with us to improve that aspect at all. Her comments on essays were not helpful, although she will work with you during office hours. Listen and nod, even if you don't agree with what she's saying. The workload is lighter than most other Writing 5 classes, so that's a plus. I found class itself to be okay, depending on Prof. Piper's mood... If you're looking to drastically improve your writing, this isn't the class for you. If you're looking to write short essays and read about.. humankind's relationship with nature, then take it.\"",
            "review 8: \"08W with Wendy Piper: Piper is nice, but a little eccentric at times. Readings are light, and if you are a good writer you will get a good grade. If not, your grade will reflect how much work you put into it. Interesting for those who like Emerson, Thoreau, etc.\"",
            "review 9: \"08W with Wendy Piper: We read Emerson, Thoreau, Black Elk and Faulkner, and wrote a short paper on each. It was pretty slow paced, and I'm more of a science person, so it wasn't really for me.\"",
            "review 10: \"08W with Wendy Piper: It was fine. I didn't particularly look forward to going to class, but when I was there it went by quickly. Prof. Piper is nice and leads discussion well. The books were OK.\"",
            "review 11: \"08W with Wendy Piper: Although Professor Piper means well in the end, and shes a very nice person in the end, her grading scheme is definitely a little close-minded. If you're an athlete, don't like writing, or just want a somewhat easy class, I would in the end recommend doing this Writing 5 among all of the others that were offered for my term atleast. However, there's an * next to that recommendation because Professor Piper can be really frustrating, and for the most part, every single class. Basically, you read authors like Thoreau, Emerson, Faulkner, etc., you know the nature loving type. The books arent too painful to read, and even can be enjoyable at times. However, there is no reason WHATSOEVER to read any of the books, EVER. (You do have to buy the books however because she definitely makes sure and notes if you bring the book to class and are taking notes) If you want to get a good grade in this class, do the following. -Be a girl -> perhaps the hardest one to do, for about half of you reading this -Vigorously note every quote she says in class-> the papers she assigns (2-4 page range normally SCORE!) all ask you to basically re-write what she says in class, and if you use the EXACT same quotes, you are absolutely golden. -Don't read the book -> she does not reward kids who make their own assertions about books, only her own opinions -Write very basic -> She hates it when people use big words to sound smart, and hates tangential paragraphs. Make sure your papers are just REALLY REALLY basic and 100% to the point. Her papers are really easy, you wont learn how to write better, but if you're lazy, an athlete, are taking hard classes, DEFINTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. SHE ALWAYS SAYS \"REAL good\" or \"REAL nice,\" its hysterical\"",
            "review 12: \"08F with Wendy Piper: I really liked Prof. Piper, both as a person and a professor. She was always available outside of class, and very quick to respond by blitz. Also, she was very knowledgeable about the novels, and liked hearing what her students thought as well. The books we read included Emerson, Hemingway, Krakauer, and Robinson. I didn't really care for Emerson (\"Nature\"), but I thought Old Man and the Sea, and Into the Wild were AMAZING. We only read 4 books, which, compared to many other Writing 5 courses I heard about, was not that much. Emerson was kind of a pain to read, but the professor was quite good at explaining it, since she specializes in American literature. The grading was extremely fair, I thought. She definitely gave good comments to improve my writing for the next paper. I think everyone made good progress in their writing from start to finish. Before every paper (we had 4 papers; 3 3-4 pages and 1 5-7 pages, which again was not too bad), we spent one day of class posting everyone's thesis statements and commenting on them. Then we spent one day of class peer reviewing each others' papers. I thought this was extremely beneficial. Overall, I thought this was a great class, and it really was a great course to bridge high school and college writing. Professor Piper cares about her students and tries her best to make them better writers. I would absolutely recommend Prof. Piper and her writing 5 class!\"",
            "review 13: \"08F with Wendy Piper: I thought I would hate this class based on the reviews I read. But, to my pleasant surprise I found that Prof. Piper is a great prof. Not only is she knowledgeable, but she is humorous, patient, and very open to different ideas and opinions. She always tried to make sure that every voice was heard and for those who were not completely comfortable with talking in front of the class, she was very understanding. I loved going to her class and even though the books may not have been the most interesting, page-turners they were much better than some of the other Writing 5 books my peers discussed. In fact, there were only 2 books that I think that were boring. Most of all, talk to her outside of class! She is a great person to get to know and once you do, her class will become that much more enjoyable. We wrote about five 3-4 page essays and one 5-6 page final. It was a great class!\"",
            "review 14: \"08F with Wendy Piper: This section of Writing 5 was pretty interesting. It focused on nature and its relationship to man and woman. The course only required that we read four major novels Nature by Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, and Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson. Additional smaller pieces such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Divinity School Address\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Emerson and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Snows of Kilimanjaro\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Hemingway were added for small comparison discussions in the beginning of the term. None of the readings are too difficult, though Piper might have added an additional 17th century Puritan piece to contrast its perspective on nature with the other authors. The class flows pretty smoothly it is offered as a 10 (which I was in) or a 2 and does not use the x-hours. Piper does have a strict attendance policy, if you miss (and that also includes coming late to class) to more than two different classes she drops your grade by some fraction of a letter. This was the only course I have ever had that maintained this kind of attendance policy. Piper did get angry with students over the course of the term and once you were on her bad side you were there for good. The solution to this is probably to have a drill or a 9L (neither of which I had fall term) in order to make sure that you get to class on time. However, office hours were another story; Piper was extremely helpful for the one time I went, although I could not bring myself to wake up early enough to go to the 8:30-9:30 AM office hours that she held before class. Piper does write stuff on the board during the lecture but there is no need to take notes or copy it down since there are no tests. We did get to watch a movie version of Into the Wild and had to do a group presentation on the book in November. The group presentation only lasted for about 7 minutes though it was by far the easiest part of the class. Otherwise for papers we brought in our thesis statements about two classes before the final paper was due and had our classmate peer review them. The peer-review sessions lasted for a full class and were pretty helpful; it was humorous though to see Piper try to get the computer to work. The class had three five page papers based on Emerson, Hemingway, and Krakauer, a set of online grammar exercises from the Diana Hacker handbook, the oral presentation, and one final seven page paper on a topic related to one of the authors read for the term. I say take it but remember to stay on top of the reading schedule, its not too hard, compared to other course that you will see later on.\"",
            "review 15: \"07W with Wendy Piper: the class was not particularly interesting but it did match its ORC description. i had a tough time with the class just because i found the nature topic to be extremely boring. professor piper is really nice though and has an interesting sense of humor. your writing will not change dramatically but it does improve somewhat. make sure you participate because shes big on that. but if you're not into the nature topic dont pick the class because it will be pretty painful despite piper's love for the subject.\"",
            "review 16: \"07W with Wendy Piper: The class was good because we only had to read four books and write four papers. Overall it was pretty simple and everything that I didn't understand about the reading was covered in discussion.\"",
            "review 17: \"07W with Wendy Piper: The course is pretty good, and the stuff you read is great (especially if you like reading about nature). Professor Piper, on the other hand, is not so great. She has a preconceived notion of exactly what the books mean, and doesn't allow students perspectives to come out without pretty much condemning them. There is a 'right' way to read and interpret the books, which, in my mind, is crap. I guess that may just be the system in general though. Anyway, I'd consider reading the books on your own, and taking a different course.\"",
            "review 18: \"07W with Wendy Piper: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! you don't learn to write, it's all about trying to have the same view as Piper. No one needs to know how to analyze literature, we should be learning how to improve our writing. She totally turned me off writing. It was all about interpreting the readings \"correctly\" and no focus on your ability to write. Piper is extremely biased and quickly choses her favorite students; if you are not a favorite, tough luck, then don't expect good grades.\"",
            "review 19: \"07W with Wendy Piper: Three papers up to 4 pages each, plus a final research paper - all topics discussed thoroughly (if anything, too thoroughly). Go to office hours - she helps a lot - but make sure you really narrow your focus before going. She's truly nice and personable.\"",
            "review 20: \"07F with Wendy Piper: good class.\"",
            "review 21: \"07F with Wendy Piper: Overall, the class was ok. Professer Piper is generally amiable, and excited to be in class. Only read four works, none of which were books. Not a lot of reading, though sometimes it can be dense. In class, discussions are frequent, productive and fun, but I found that in papers the professor graded way more favorably to her own opinion. I sometimes found myself shifting my view just so I wouldn't get another poor grade for a well written paper that was divergent from her view. Also, \"Style\" exercises are very boring and lead to dumbing down my writting. Overall not a hard class, but I don't feel like my writing got better. If anything, it may have gotten worse. Professor missed 3 classes, which was a very welcome surprise.\"",
            "review 22: \"07F with Wendy Piper: This class was a study of the main transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau), and two more modern writers who owed them some debt (Faulkner's \"The Bear\", Neihardt's \"Black Elk Speaks\"). The nature connection, which Professor Piper kept trying to hamemr in, despite the more general concepts that were discussed, ultimately made the works less interesting for me by limiting their interpretation to such a narrow focus. This was a theme throughout the course, as paper topics until the final one were very narrow. That being said, Piper knows her stuff, and while she isn't the sort of Professor who blows you away with her scholarship, we had good class disscussions and I think she's a perfectly nice person. The style excersizes were extremely tedious, though I learned a couple points about writing that I didn't need to copy paragraphs to learn. As for the material, It's good to read Emerson at some point, and most people liked that, though I think \"The Bear\" might have turned people off from Faulkner, which is a shame. (Everyone's first Faulkner story should be \"A Rose for Emily\"). It wasn't my first Writing 5 choice (it was my fourth) but if it fits your schedule or nothing really excites you, I can't not recommend it.\"",
            "review 23: \"07F with Wendy Piper: not too bad for a writing 5 class. Piper is understanding and nice. There are only 4 books, 4 papers, and a tiny research assignment.\"",
            "review 24: \"07F with Wendy Piper: I learned next to nothing about being a better writer in this class. Piper never really accurately conveyed what she was looking for in essays. If anything I learned to be a worse writer than I was in highschool.\"",
            "review 25: \"07F with Wendy Piper: The description of this class makes it sound pretty cool, but by the end you are kind of sick of writing about the same sort of things in nature over and over again. But the texts were still pretty interesting. My biggest issue with the class was trying to get used to Prof. Piper. She has her own way of doing things that is very different from my own, so I had to completely forget everything I had learned before and learn to write her way. I am not sure how much this reflects how most other professor will want you to write. I learned a few useful tips about writing from the class. While I don't think there was a drastic change in my writing quality, there was definitely some writing development from the beginning of the term to the end. The most stressful thing was finding office hour time. It is there, but everyone realizes that Prof. Piper has her own opinions on how to do everything, so there was a lot of competition for office hour time so we could get her advice/feedback. It was fine as a required course, and I learned a little, but was really glad when it was over. I would recommend going for another class and keeping this as your second or third choice. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt amazing either.\"",
            "review 26: \"07F with Wendy Piper: I think that this class is perfect for a first year student. Although most of the books are challenging, we discuss them thoroughly so that any questions are answered in depth before a paper is writen. Also, we wrote drafts for all of our papers, which were reviewed by a writing assistant so that changes could be made before the final paper was due. Also, we only read about 4 novels (therefore 4 papers), which is definitely a managable workload. Plus, Professor Piper is great and makes sure there is ample time for everything, so I never felt rushed.\"",

            "review 28: \"07F with Wendy Piper: Although Prof. Piper is very educated in her field, she is also very biased to her opinion. If you don't agree with her ideas, then she seems to take it personally. The course itself is pretty redundant. Relating nature to its impact on ourselves can only be taken so far, and that relationship was established during the first reading. The following four readings merely re-enforce that relation in an ineffective, redundant, repetitious fashion. Overall, I'm just happy the course is over, and i advise, unless you don't mind submitting to an opinionated prof, that you don't take her class.\"",

I can't deal with the prof and she seemed to have a lot of problems with some of the students at least in our class. Maybe it would be ok if the subject were interesting, but it was dense and boring and i couldn't even fall asleep in class because it was a small class.\"",

The professor did a good job of encouraging discussion.\"",

I seriously thought about dropping the class but then I decided to stick with it and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really happy with the decision I made.

If your Jewish, don't let her catch on; hinting that you don't accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior will definitely drop your grade to a minus point, as long as you don't introduce it into your writing.

Most people in the class were really into politics and I would heavily recommend this class if you are too. The Supreme Court with Professor Julie Kalish has the rep of being one of the hardest WRIT 5 classes out there and for good reason. Kalish grades papers really harshly but you have the opportunity to do endless revisions. This means that you will probably find yourself writing and re-writing throughout the term until you have your desired grade.

We analyzed current Supreme Court cases and presented on them in groups, and we also wrote a group explanation and analysis on the case. Most of the readings were Supreme Court cases, in particular the ones following the right to privacy and its development before and after Roe v. Wade. Besides the group work, there were three other papers: an individual argumentative paper about your current case (3-5 pages), a group or solo paper (you could choose to work solo or in a group, 3-5 pages) about judicial philosophy, and a 10-15 page individual research paper. All of the different papers, including the group ones, could be revised as many times as you want, with plenty of graded feedback provided after each draft, even when you got a high scoring paper. It is extremely doable to get the grade that you want in this class, all you have to do is put in the effort. The class itself was mostly discussions that class's court case, which I personally enjoyed because it meant that we could talk about the implications of the case and its effects.

Class was generally low pressure discussions of various supreme court readings, which were fun and interesting. Only gripe I had was while she's clear about grades for individual papers, how your final grade is determined is largely a mystery.

Professor Kalish is an effective teacher, and while sometimes it does not feel like you are learning in her class (because it is heavily discussion based--if thats your speed take this class!), your writing nonetheless becomes better by the end of the term. This opportunity for growth is partly because she offers unlimited revisions and will provide you detailed, personalized feedback on each draft. This term the class was on Zoom, so I'm not sure how it is IRL, but she often made us sign up for office hours with her too so that we could actually discuss how to act on her feedback. It was not intimidating at all, despite how smart she is. Take advantage of the meetings and revisions, because it allows you to get the grade you work for. Speaking of work: if you're looking for a WRIT 5 with an easy workload, this isn't it. We read a whole book the first two weeks, at least one Supreme Court opinion each week thereafter, and studied various methods of constitutional change. Prof Kalish is there to help you understand and write about each reading, but that doesn't mean they aren't hard and demanding. Still, that should not scare you away.

            "review 14: \"18W with Julie Kalish: Julie!!!! Kalish!!!! She is the best writing 5 prof that you can get. Look through the rest of the reviews of this class. Virtually every single one is glowing-- absolutely no negative reviews, and only like one lukewarm review. That's unheard of. Aside from being one of the best, this class is also probably one of the hardest writing 5 classes, but it is SO worth it. First off, Kalish is brilliant. She's a Dartmouth alum with both a master's and a law degree, so she knows what she's talking about and can answer all kinds of questions regarding the class material (and beyond). She's also an excellent teacher-- very receptive to her students, active in class, always looking for discussion opportunities, generous with her office hours, and willing to grant the occasional extension if you need it. If you have any interest in the Supreme Court whatsoever, you will love this class. For a gov buff like myself, it was a blast. You analyze Supreme Court cases that are currently pending a ruling, write about them, discuss, analyze, and present. You also look at past court cases and judicial philosophy, giving you a pretty in-depth understanding of the Court and the Justices. You write a lot for this class and have an ongoing group project. If you want anything above a B or B+ in the class, you have to revise everything you write multiple times (it took me 4 drafts to get a B+ paper to an A\u2026 And I consider myself to be a good writer). Most people assume unlimited revisions = guaranteed A-- this is NOT true. The revisions require significant work, and you only have so much time to do them. Again, the workload is worth the class. Your writing will noticeably improve over the course of 10 weeks. Kalish is also pretty cool. She's super with-it, can relate to her students, and is an all-around 10/10 prof. I honestly want to go to her office hours just to hang out after this course ends. Besides the fact that this writing 5 is one of the best and most difficult, it is also one of the hardest to get into. If you're one of the obscenely lucky freshmen to get into the course, TAKE IT.\"",

She truly cares about improving her students' work. She is incredibly sharp and also just fun to be around. Since she's so smart, she grades really tough, but allows for ENDLESS REVISIONS!! Kalish wants to give good grades but only does it if the student deserves it. I rewrote SO MANY papers, but by the end, my work was incredibly clear. In her office, she tells you exactly what she wants from you. I could not have had a better Writing 5 than with Kalish, and everyone told me how jealous they were that they didn't get her.

She is always willing to help you with your writing assignments, and her copious comments will make your writing better.

You will read landmark Supreme Court cases and explore current cases, and explore writing in different styles that improve your writing and comfort with the writing process. Kalish gives SO much feedback on your papers. Even when you pull off a good grade, she'll give you back a paper full of comments. It's a little scary the first time, but the comments are priceless and really constructive.

She knows what she's talking about, she knows how to write, she knows how to teach, and she's a '91 so she knows how Dartmouth students operate. I knew very little about the Supreme Court coming into this class and now I know lots. The cases are boring; just develop your own method of dealing with them. The other readings are worth your time and although you'll never be tested on them, read it for the sake of learning. Be warned though: you might have aced every essay in high school but Kalish is a hard grader when it comes to papers. However, you can correct as much as you want to bring your grade up. You'll have to do three essays, a group project, and one research paper. That's it.

As far as workload goes, there are two or three rounds of articles to read which are rather light. You are constantly writing and meeting deadlines but the writing is broken up into segments and the deadlines are fairly spaced so that it's never too much at once.

We even were able to correspond with a GM official over GM health policy. Exciting to say the least. The topic material was fascinating and I learned immensely; the conversation in class was also great, and was supplemented by Kremer's excellent conversation style. Vigorous discussion was encouraged, she made sure everyone spoke, and we were allowed to take the conversation in our own direction (except for the occasional tangent that had to be reined in). The papers were clear in their expectations, and by the end of the term I knew I had become a better writer.

        "John Donaghy": [
            "review 1: \"11W with John Donaghy: This was the worst class I've taken yet, and I'm annoyed because it had the potential to be really interesting. We ended up skipping about a third of the readings in the syllabus and 2 of the papers because no one understood the dense, dry philosophical material we were asked to read and write about. Professor Donaghy, though he seemed to care about us and how we were doing, did nothing but go off on tangents during class. The students barely talked, and we had no real discussions at all. I never fully understood the material, and most of the other class members I talked to didn't seem to either. We didn't even read the Greeks themselves. We read much much later philosophies that mentioned the thinkers. Professor Donaghy didn't seem comfortable with us arguing our own points on the work - he just kept saying \"find patterns!\" When I turned in my first paper written in this fashion he attacked it for not having an argument. When I wrote my next paper I weakened my argument to better fit his suggestions and then again got knocked for not arguing strong enough. When I finally wrote in a manner that I considered full of crap, I got a much better grade. Go figure. I'd been told to expect this kind of thing in my Writing 5 class but this seemed much worse than even my older friends expected. It's a shame, because the material had the ability to be really interesting - class and assignments just got in the way of it.\"",
            "review 2: \"11W with John Donaghy: This class started on a really good note - I liked Professor Donaghy's philosophy about writing a lot, and the mythology that we read at first was very interesting. Unfortunately, that didn't last. The material that we read for the class was not always relevant to the main subject of the Presocratic philosophers, and it was extremely dense and often uninteresting. The structure of the class fell apart as we went, with the syllabus changing many times within the last few weeks. Professor Donaghy makes himself available to talk to a lot, but my biggest problem is that it is near impossible to know how you are doing in the class. He puts a lot of emphasis on the writing process and your reading journals, but doesn't say a single word about how you are doing with the entries. I got back papers that seemed to receive lower-than-expected grades, seemingly because he disagreed with the argument. I ended up feeling that I was writing what he would want to see instead of making my own arguments and style. I had three major problems with this class. First, the grading system was absolutely arbitrary, as if at the end of the term he looked at your paper and decided what your grade was, without regard to the nine weeks prior. Secondly, Donaghy plays favorites pretty clearly. He had no problem handing As to students who missed about a quarter of the classes (although the syllabus said missing two was a letter deduction), and it felt like if you didn't have his approval from the beginning he just wouldn't be satisfied with anything you produced. Finally, while he said that writing quality was most important, he seemed to mark papers only for points he disagreed with. He expected each paper to be better than the last, but we received literally no feedback or instruction on how to actually write better. I think that Donaghy is a nice and open guy, but he needs to make his grading system and class more structured and objective. I unfortunately left this class feeling like I had not improved at all.\"",
            "review 3: \"09F with John Donaghy: The first half was a lot more interesting for me because we were studying Greek tragedy (Oedipus the King and The Bacchae). The papers were okay, classic analyticals really, just have to find a way of writing them that makes the prof happy. The second half was Freud. And lots of it. The final paper, a symposium between Freud, Claxton, Euripides and Sophocles, was interesting and more creative than the other assignments (I hate five-paragraph essays and while the assignments weren't exactly fivers, they needed \"topic sentences\" etc., which is okay, but just be prepared for it). Prof Donaghy is interesting and has mandatory meetings to discuss papers outside of class. He doesn't give explicit details on how to fix papers or provide any in-line help, just an overview. He knows what he's talking about most of the time though. Going to class was a lot more fun in the beginning. When it turned to Freud, well, Freud is really hard to make fun... This wasn't really a writing class. The first half was Greek tragedy and the second half was psychology-esque Freud and Claxton. We didn't do any peer editing or very much writing actually, just four essays and the final.\"",
            "review 4: \"09F with John Donaghy: 1.) Do not be deceived by pior SA reviews of this professor and this particular course. 2.) If you like Greek Tragedy and love Freud then take this class at your own risk. A majority of the class is spent understanding the interpretation of Dreams by Freud. Donaghy's concept of teaching relies on you not being competent with the material at all. He wants you to get lost in the material and really find a way to understand things that cannot be understood fully. This sounds like a great method, but Donaghy does not really give you any way to help you figure out what you do not not understand. He expects you to keep going over hard material and let it saturate it in your unconscious until you are consciously able to perceive it. This probably sounds like bullshit...and that's because it really is. It is the best excuse for a lazy professor to get away with not putting much effort into getting students to understand material. 3.) Do you like to know your progess in your classes? Then do not take this class. Not a single comment was ever put on any of my papers or anyone else's for that matter. Essentially, Donaghy gives you a lecture in the beginning, urging you to not care about grades. This lecture makes it hard for you to be blunt and ask about the grade. Ultimately, you hope that his arbitrary assessment meshes with your opinion on your grade. 4.) It is nice that he offers individual paper consultations, but he could just have a class one, because he says the same thing to everybody. He basically tells everyone that their thesis statements are not good and the structure of the essay sucks-best way to get out of taking papers home and reading them. During one of my consultations, Donaghy admitted that he hadn't read my paper until he just read it aloud to me during the consultation-no joke. This course does not reach its aim. You do not learn how to write better and you do not learn how to research. You also do not work on oral skills. Anytime you volunteer in class, expect to be shot down or humiliated, unless, you are a favorite of his. Class is essentially spent sitting and starring at a clock or wishing that you could be anywhere else. Donaghy doesnt inspire class discussion. Instead, he continues to ramble on-for 65 min. straight about his knowledge of the literature. It is pretty admirable that he is that knowledgable, but at the same time he comes across as very pompous.\"",
            "review 5: \"09F with John Donaghy: This class was amazing. Taking this class has been my best decision so far at Dartmouth. Professor Donaghy is an awesome guy. He's always open to questions and even curses in class. Also, he's always available for office hours. We read Oedipus the King, The Bacchae, The Interpretation of Dreams, and Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind. We had 5 papers and one rewrite. Donaghy is really into getting lost and confused and then working your way out of the confusion through in-class discussions and looking at the text. He teaches you how to really analyze literature, step by step. It's invaluable. Since Donaghy wants you to \"get lost,\" there are no \"grades\" on the papers in the traditional sense of the word. Instead, he just wants to see that you are \"engaging in the writing process.\" Our final grade was based on how much we engaged in the writing process and the quality of our final paper, which was a conversation among all the authors of the books we read. This means that some may feel that the final grade was a bit arbitrary but I think he was fair in his assessment of everyone's work and effort. Overall, this class was amazing. It may have been a bit draggy at times, but I ended up grasping hard concepts and learned how to write with clarity and focus. Also, Donaghy is brilliant.Take this class and you will not regret it.\"",
            "review 6: \"08W with John Donaghy: Professor Donaghy is a really good professor and very helpful outside of class. He is always willing to help with the papers, and I feel much more confident as a writer after taking this class. The books we read were good and class discussions were generally pretty interesting, but what really made this class for me was how helpful Donaghy was at office hours and his advice on writing in general, because that's what will help with future classes and papers.\"",
            "review 7: \"08W with John Donaghy: Donaghy is an amazing prof. He is genuinely interested in teaching and does a great job at connecting all of the readings. Lectures were in depth and interesting. Grading of the papers was tough. One on one revising of papers with him during office hours helps a lot.\"",
            "review 8: \"08W with John Donaghy: Donaghy is the man! Not only is he a great lecturer and always available for help outside class, but he also understands how hard it is to take a 9 week writing course. He makes the workload manageable and improves your writing skills so much. We wrote four papers and had freedom in choosing what we were interested in writing in those papers. This course is worth taking with Donaghy- he makes it fun with his great sense of humor and makes it manageable as well.\"",
            "review 9: \"08F with John Donaghy: Going in to freshman fall I had heard that a great professor can save a bad course and that a terrible professor can ruin an otherwise good course. While the latter may be true, having a good professor is a necessary standard, not a sufficient one. Main point here is that if you're going to enroll in a class about old epic poems, make sure that you're going to be able to read them. Despite his using early grades as a scare tactic to shock students into working harder, Donaghy actually does care about you as a person and will do his best to provide feedback and ideas for your writing. He was available for office hours whenever I needed him and was generally very responsive to my questions.\"",
            "review 10: \"08F with John Donaghy: the Illiad is a bit tedius but Donaghy would go through each chapter in class so in theory you didn't have to read. We only had 2 major writing assignments and 1 re-write along with one essay on dreams so really wasnt a significant amount of work. Office hours were amazing GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! Donaghy will practicly write you essays for you!\"",
            "review 11: \"08F with John Donaghy: Since Writing 5 is a required, it could have been a painful class. But Donaghy was a great professor. He was really interesting and chill during class. We spent the entire term basically The Iliad, which meant there was very little nightly work. Prof. Dongahy made a class on a sometimes dull book really fun. There were also only three papers and he gave you a ton of feedback during the writing process. I would definitely recomend writing 5 with prof. donaghy.\"",
            "review 12: \"08F with John Donaghy: I did not do much work for this course and still came out with a nice grade. Most of the readings can be done through spark notes and you really do not have to participate in class if you do not want to. The Iliad is not too bad surprisingly and Donaghy knows the text incredibly well and is willing to discuss themes within the text at length. There was very little covered on PTSD however. A dream analysis also featured in the course. Donaghy is a caring prof who really takes a personal interest in his students and does make a positive impact on writing and literary analysis. This course is a lot of fun with a great prof and does not need much work. Take it.\"",
            "review 13: \"07F with John Donaghy: Quite possibly one of the best writing 5 classes at dartmouth.\"",
            "review 14: \"07F with John Donaghy: The class started off very fun, but it went downhill with Freud. It's not the professor's fault though... it's just Freud. When we read Beowulf (the first reading), class participation was high. But nobody was interested in discussing Freud.\"",
            "review 15: \"07F with John Donaghy: I chose this class based on these SA professor reviews alone, because apparently in college a professor can make or break a class, whatever class it is. All the other reviews were right, Donaghy is the man, he's a great professor, he doesn't give you too much work (two total papers I think and a billion drafts), he'll give you extensions, etc. Take a class with him, any class, you'll have so much fun (and he's hilarious). The only problem for me anyway was that I had think in a totally new way for this class that I still don't totally understand, and the Freud was some of the hardest material I've ever read. Freud in general is difficult, so maybe that was it, but that was my only problem. You'll never regret taking a class with Donaghy so go for it.\"",
            "review 16: \"07F with John Donaghy: Donaghy's class is structured around discussions. He expects you to do the readings and he spends the class period answering questions from the reading. He will not grade anything all term but I feel like this is more beneficial toward the students as our writing/thinking is then unmarked by a grade. If you go to office hours, he will guide you in the right direction if you need any help. You will struggle with the reading, but you will learn a great deal in this class. Prof Donaghy's purpose is not to teach you how to write, because most people who come into the class can write very well, but he focuses on helping us organize ideas. I think this is why he chose such difficult reading materials for us to organize (Freud, especially), but at the end of the term, you realize how much terrain we've covered and you feel really good about the class. P.S. Donaghy looks like Freud.\"",
            "review 17: \"07F with John Donaghy: Not all that glitter is gold... The course description was off. We were supposed to read Freud, Beowulf, and some 100 articles on the subprime mortgage crises. The latter was shaved off for more Freud time. We had a total of two papers. (One summary that wasn't turn in, and two short essays that were.) No grades were given until the final. Feedback on papers wasn't accurate. No real writing instruction took place in the classroom. The class was EXTREMELY focused on Freud. As in... we didn't learn how to write. We had a few \"writing workshops,\" but that just meant we could talk to him about our papers during class time. But, even then, it wasn't really about writing as much as just more Freud talk. The professor was available, and his hours were awesome. You could meet with him whenever you had a question. Although I think this was the only strong point. (Even during the office hours, though... it was geared more towards the content as opposed to actual writing skills.) So, unless you want a course that has little work, you want to have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER on how you're doing in the class, and want to learn about Freud... take this! Otherwise, don't.\"",

He understands life at Dartmouth and is very willing to give extensions if you are too stressed.

Classes can be boring and repetitive but analyzing everyone else's dreams is fun.\"",

This course is very much based on discussions in class. The best part is that he places no page requirement on the papers, so you can write a 2-page paper and it will be fine. Bottom Line: Take this course if you can. An uplifting course in an otherwise banal term.\"",

She is incredibly passionate about this course and puts all of her effort into it. While her expectations are high, her enthusiasm and incredible personality motivate you to do well. The course consisted of three papers (roughly 3 pages double spaced each) and a final ten page research paper on the history of a crime of your choice. Sarge is a stickler on the passive voice and will get you writing actively by the end of the course. Her paper edits were very extensive and constructive.

            "review 13: \"08W with Jennifer Brooke: \"Balls,\" I thought, as I entered the seminar room at the back of Jones Media Center for a class that I had been dreading since I learned, during the summer, that I would have to take it. I've never enjoyed writing. It's an essential tool for anyone hoping to lead a successful career, yes, but I see it as an unfortunate means to an end. That being said, \"Crime, the Criminal Mind, and the Courtroom,\" has perhaps been the most enjoyable class I've experienced so far at Dartmouth (I know, it's only out of nine possible choices at this point). The reading list was great. There were no boring selections on South African writers of the 18th century or perspectives on the Nunavut. We were fed appetizing servings of one hard-hitting true-crime murder story after another. This was actually my first course that required any substantial reading at all, and it was a nice introduction. The reading was never painful, and the open forum discussions enhanced the experience. Even the papers were \"fun.\" Describe your favorite food. Analyze a crime you've committed. Research a true crime of your choice and describe it from whatever perspective you want. Evaluate whether or not the adversarial fact-finding justice system undermines the truth-seeking function. Okay. That last one not so much. But for the most part, writing the papers was never a bother, and the peer-critique method (which was not optional) proved surprisingly helpful. Rewrites were also allowed. So basically I'm saying the class is great, right? But I'm certain that it would have turned out very differently in the hands of another professor. Professor Sargent was the lifeblood of the class; she brought a distinct flavor and character to it. Her unabashed bluntless in all matters created an extremely open atmosphere where one would never be afraid to voice a certain idea or opinion. And she's not afraid to curse. More than with any other professor I've yet encountered, I feel that I could sit down and have a legitimate conversation with Professor Sargent on topics beyond the scope of the class. She was so very accessible and inviting that I wouldn't think twice about contacting her in a time of need, even now that the class is over. Grading is very fair in my opinion. Her attendance policy is strict (although I'm the kind of person who would never dream of missing any class, ever), and the only true grades come from papers. But that's fine, because there are rewrites, and she makes any and all corrections abundantly clear. And if you don't understand something, she is more than willing to discuss it after class (or during an appointment). It's more than unlikely that I will go into the field of law, and I still dislike writing, but Professor Sargent's Writing 5 was genuinely enjoyable. I highly recommend it.\"",

Sarge is a firm believer of writing as a process - and pushes her students to step outside of our comfort zone, strive to improve, and take risks. There was some peer editing which was also helpful in developing a voice for critiquing and giving insight. Class is never dull - Prof. Sarge has a sharp wit and is engaged from start to finish. Sometimes it would feel like the hour plus wasn't enough (in the good way). As for workload, there is about a paper a week, which is very reasonable. All in all, a great great class, incredibly rewarding writing-wise, and superb teaching. You will learn so much; I strongly urge you to take it!\"",

            "review 17: \"08F with Jennifer Brooke: This class was one of the best classes I have ever taken in my life. Professor Sargent is a New Hampshire judge, former public defender, law professor at University of Vermont law school, and hip-hop booty and abs instructor (she's super super fit!). We generally read a book a week (sometimes long, sometimes short) and wrote a 2-5 page paper a week. We handed our rough drafts in on Wednesday to Professor Sargent and our peer critique partner. We received critiques from both on Friday and turned our final drafts in on Monday. Our final assignment was a 10-page paper telling the story of a crime of our choice. Every book that Professor Sargent assigned us was exciting and interesting to read. They were all about murder and crime, so I often had trouble putting them down. Professor Sargent is not only a crime expert, but also a superb writing teacher. My writing improved greatly over the course of the term (don't judge it based on this review). I am a much more confident college writer than I was when I got here. The class can be a good bit of work at times, but it is definitely worth it. The Sarge grades on improvement, participation, and effort in addition to the actual writing. She truly wants everyone to be excited about the class and improve their expository prose. You are very unlikely to fail a paper because she edits your rough draft first. If you take her suggestions into account, you should be fine. The bottom line is that everyone should take this class. I could not have imagined a better Writing 5 choice.\"",

Some of the books were long so don't procrastinate on the reading, but it was manageable. The papers aren't bad either- most were under 3 pages. The final paper was really interesting. Professor Sargent is an amazing person. She's funny and helpful and tells great stories. Most importantly, she really helped improve my writing. For every paper, we peer critiqued it and she critiqued it separately before we turned in the final draft. In the end, every pattern of writing we studied came together perfectly. As long as you don't mind reading about people killing each other, take this class!\"",

This class is worth all the work and all the reading. You read about 5 books and write 4 essays which vary between 2-4 pages. Though the final paper is 10 pages, you have about a month to do it. Take this class with the Sarge!\"",
            "review 20: \"08F with Jennifer Brooke: I took this class my freshman fall (a year ago). I am majoring in math, and I have never been a particularly strong writer. Professor Sargent's writing 5 definitely helped me make the leap from high school to college writing. There is a lot of reading in this class, but all of it is interesting and entertaining (real books, not texts). Professor Sargent assigns a paper about every other week (with extensive rewrites to each) which are also fairly time consuming. She limits the length of each paper, so quality, not mass, is the main challenge. There was also one oral competition, though this was not counted in the final class grade. Professor Sargent is a very fair grader. She recognized that different students have different ability and mainly judges you on improvement and effort. She is very sharp and reads papers carefully, so your arguments must be strong and well supported. It is mandatory to attend every class, but her lectures are riveting and do not feel drawn out or trivial. She expects regular class participation, but if you're on the quiet side (like me) she'll look more to see that you are paying attention and considering what you hear, so don't worry. Over all, this was my favorite class so far at Dartmouth, and, even though it was difficult, I would happily take a class with Professor Sargent again.\"",
            "review 21: \"08F with Jennifer Brooke: SARGE IS AWESOME There is really nothing bad about this class. Sargent is not only an engaging lecturer, but also she presents the material in a very clear and organized way. The point of Writing 5 is to make you a better writer, and this class does just that. The classroom discussions are a huge part of this class and make it really fun. Sargent does an excellent job of managing the classroom, so everyone participates in the discussions, and you really get to know people, both on a personal level and in an \"intellectual\" way, if that makes sense. I met some of my very good friends in Sarge's class. The workload is reasonable and your writing really will improve by the end of the term. Personally, this class gave me a completely new perspective on what good writing should be, and now I am interested in being a writer. Also, the background material is so cool (Charles Manson!), and it's very, very, very hard to ever be bored in this class. As of my Sophomore Fall, this is the best, most enjoyable class I've taken so far at Dartmouth.\"",

There was a good deal of outside reading, but most of the assigned novels were extremely interesting. We had to write about one essay each week and the topics always made me think outside the box and stretched my brain quite a bit. As far as the essays go, Sargent never settled for just a \"good\" essay; she pushed you until you had a \"great\" essay. While this was frustrating a times, it ultimately helped me improve my writing. If given the chance, I would definitely recommend taking a class with Sargent. She is intimidating at first, but warms up with time. She is also so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topic that you can't help but become interested in every aspect of the class.\"",

She sat in blobby for HOURS during her WEEKEND to go over papers line by line to help students improve their papers as much as possible.

The subject matter of the course can definitely be heavy, but that is to be expected based on the course description. It is very important to read the assigned readings for the class (which are actually very interesting and not that plentiful) because it is painfully obvious who did not read the assigned readings during class discussions. There are three essays and Prof Deutsch gave lots of time to work on the essays so there was never an essay that felt unmanageable in the given time. Additionally, she let us use parts of previous essays in our later essays in the course, so if you write a good first two essays, the final essay is super easy. 100% would recommend taking this class with Prof Deutsch.\"",

Additionally, the low for the essays never falls under a B, and most people get A\u2019s on the final essay that\u2019s worth 30%, meaning that almost everyone gets an A for the course. The journals are easily BSable, especially when knowing that she\u2019ll give you an A anyways. You don\u2019t need to read any of the memoirs to get an A as well, the essays are unrelated.\"",

The topics, discussions, and readings are so interesting that you don't even feel you are in a writing class. At the same time, Professor Deutsch is amazing in teaching writing and I learned so much with her. She is sweet, understanding, and a genius! She has so much knowledge and she explains the topics in a very good way. This class is heavy on work - we had a lot of readings - but it is totally manageable and the work is so interesting that is not hard to do it. The readings are not hard and we have to write essays about them on a journal, which at first I didn't; like it that much but turned out to be a huge highlight of the class. Moreover, we only have two graded essays of 5 pages each. The journal counts for 25% of the grade, we have a group power point presentation that counts for more 20%, then two essays and 10% of participation.

She is the kindest and funniest professor I've had at Dartmouth, and you will end the course with a high grade. She is extremely informative in class and class is always fun and entertaining. There are daily journal entries of 1-2 pages that must be HANDWRITTEN, but as long as you do them with some care it will be a grade booster. There is also nightly reading or movie watching, but everything is manageable. The books and movies are all interesting, the the topic of the class is obviously substantive and worthwhile. An important note is that although the course is called Gender and the Holocaust, the GENDER aspect is very SMALL and you basically don't even need to address it ever. So if you are worried about the class being too focused on that, it is not. However, if you choose to write through a gendered lens, you may and Prof. D will encourage you and it will also be a great class for you.

Prof D. was so funny and always up for a chat, and you could feel that she really cared about her class. The lectures were generally centred around modern European history in the context of Jews and the events preceding WWII, and they weren't necessarily always directly helpful in improving my writing, but I genuinely found them interesting and enjoyed logging onto class each morning. Each essay has 2 unmarked drafts that Prof D marks and returns to you within 48 hours or so, and she is always more than happy to give you more help if you want it.

So if you take his class, make very sure to take him out to lunch. That said, don't take his class. I suppose if you are looking for an easy class, this is sort of it, although it sure is frustrating. Throughout high school, a lot of people would claim that analysis in English class was bs, and I strongly disagreed. Kevin, however, is the exception. Some of the material seems valid, and the material that have nothing to do with the course are very interesting (specifically, analysis of film clips). But a lot of what Kevin said made little sense upon closer inspection. His arguments were highly circular (A proves B, and B proves A), and he on several instances used pop song lyrics by the likes of Snow Patrol as evidence for his out-there ideas. But above all else, be warned about the workload. The reading is fine (not particularly helpful, but the ones that you actually needed to read were easy reads, and I didn't read the more difficult ones). It's the essays. The first was a 2000-word adjectiveless poem, about love, without using the word love. I might have avoided the course if I knew about that assignment. Then the next two were group essays (that's right, write two papers as a group). Getting feedback on these isn't exactly helpful for improving your writing skills, since one is a poem, and the other two aren't actually your essay, you are only a contributor. The only essay that I could have received valuable feedback for is the research paper, and that is due on the last day of class.

Kevin is very into the whole \"go with the flow\" philosophy of life and even told us on the first day he didn't know where this class would end up. His instruction is valuable for the style he wants, but you likely won't be using that style anywhere else, so it might not help you. I did like that Kevin lets you rewrite any paper you want for a better grade. For a course called 'Argument in Songwriting', I thought we talked about some incredibly random, though sometimes interesting other topics, including \"what is music?\" Overall, amusing and relatively easy course, though it's sometimes difficult to know what Kevin wants from you.

He didn't do a whole lot of teaching on how to write papers but he did focus a lot on how to revise and restructure.

I'm not going to talk about the course because the fact is that this stuff switches from between terms with the professor. I'm going to focus on the Prof. Kevin simply doesn't teach. Truthfully, I'm not so sure you can learn about writing in 9 weeks, especially when there are only four papers due. Further, there is little time given before the drafts are due to work on the papers... which is kinda bizarre considering there are so few assigned. The man is simply disorganized and needs to get on that ASAP. He is nice enough to allow you to rewrite the first three papers he assigns. The problem of course is that I followed his advice.... and still got the same grade. He said \"you didn't change the structure\". My response was simply \"you simply told me I needed to add this material, the structure you said was fine\". So basically, I did rewrites for no reason. I really feel a rewrite is only good if you massively screwed up on the first draft. If you have, then you are in good shape. Because he expects less of you and is more lenient in later drafts of the paper and later papers in general (he's looking for \"progress\"). That progress is good and all, if you came in not knowing how to write. But if you know somewhat what to do, then your chances for progress are slim. The forth paper he didn't allow you to rewrite.... which basically makes you are screwed if you f it up. The shining reviews that are up for Kevin McCarthy are mostly due to him being a nice guy. He does not assign a ton of work. But unlike the other teachers, this doesn't mean you will get a good grade. But it certainly means, you won't learn how to write.\"",

While the other students in the class really irritated us (particularly this one girl who kept on blowing her nose), I found Venkatesan's prelectual performances to be enlightening, like sunshine in a dirty toilet. I am currently designing my own major in Postlogical Hermneutics and their Application to the Morphogenetic Field, inspired largely by Venkatesan's metadiscourses on \"science\" and \"society\" (yes, accepting the complications of the terms). During office hours (MWF 3-5pm Carpenter 107), She illustrated her Weltanschauung and contrasts it with the more insidious Weltanschauungen of Tom Cormen and the other pre-Derridian \"academics\" in the Writing department. (Some of them only have \"M.A.'s\" from the \"University of Toledo\".) The lectures became microcosmic proscenia of the absurdity and hyper-reality of post-constructionist \"society\". In our final laboratory expose we were made to write a short paper on what respect of Prof Venkatesan means to us. I wrote a tome. Venkatesan's Gesamtkunstwerk is a kaleidoscopic travelogue through contemporary semiotic anapleroticos. I will always treasure this experience as a formative block in my own Bildungsroman at Dartmouth University (no \"mistake,\" for Venkatesan 's presence qualifies this signifier).

Almost every member of the class was personally attacked in some form in the class by either intimidation or ignoring your questions/comments/concerns. If you decide to take this class, prepare to NOT be allowed to express your own opinions in class because you have \"yet to obtain your Ph.D/masters/bachelors degree\". We were forced to write an in-class essay on \"respect\" (and how we lacked it) because we expressed our views on controversial topics and some did not agree with the views of \"established scholars\" who have their degrees.

The material we jumped into was way over our heads and the readings were downright impossible and painful. The prof even told us that this was graduate level reading, but nevertheless, she just assigned us more readings on top of the books we had to read. As for the professor, she seems to be very knowledgeable and an expert in what she studies. There's no question that she has a very deep and intellectual understanding of the material. But she has no idea how to teach or convey all that information to students. She would sometimes just read straight out of her notes for lecture, and even discouraged asking questions in the middle of class when something was unclear. She told us to blitz her questions that we might have been confused about, but she seldom responded to them. The lectures seemed somewhat disjointed from the readings too. The professor also seemed to have really intense mood swings. Sometimes she would convene class all of a sudden because she got really angry for reasons unknown to students. Furthermore, I am very skeptical about her teaching methods. For one of our essays, we had a rough draft due on one day. We peer reviewed each other's pieces in class, and then handed in those reviews and our papers. After promising to give us feedback the next morning, the prof instead posts on blackboard that we seem to have a good understanding of the material from what we wrote in our peer reviews. She never gave us feedback or even let us read what other people wrote about our papers. Her teaching methods are awful, and I feel like my writing has gotten worse from this course.

She was not a strong moderator, as our debates had a strong tendency of quickly degenerating from intelligent discussions to bareknuckle fistfights.

This class only has three main assignments: a personal essay, a literature review, and an op-ed presentation. The first two can be revised after the due date for full points back, so grading is definitely something you don't have to stress too much about in this class.

The course material is extremely interesting, but there's a lot of discussing your own opinion and experience in this class, so if you're looking to not be personally invested, I would not recommend. Lewis is also a harsh grader and while her revision policy is nice, I found it very hard to find time to make revisions between my two other challenging courses and the new assignments that kept coming from this course. I learned new styles of writing as well as how to go about the writing process, which I think will be really helpful for future classes. Overall, I was not a fan of the assignments but the in-class time compensated for it, because Lewis made it very engaging and positive.

The writing workshop structure of the class was really fun. I also really enjoyed the explorative exercises we had to do before drafting any of the essays because they really helped me understand the point of each kind of essay and made it easy to come up with an idea or topic. Sometimes the drafting process was a little rushed. I liked how Professor Lewis would have us turn our cameras off when we were writing. That was nice and made Zoom feel less awkward. Sometimes there was Zoom fatigue. It was nice when she cancelled class that one time though, it came at a really good time. Professor Lewis is probably actually the nicest, most amazing person alive. I literally want to be best friends with her. She created a class culture that was so enthusiastic and so supportive. I am really grateful I got to have this class with her this term. She gave amazingly extensive feedback, I have no criticisms. I loved how Professor Lewis was available to meet one-on-one with us and just pick apart our essays in the best way possible. I was introduced to a different kind of writing this term than I was previously used to, and I think my writing has without a doubt improved. I feel so prepared for college writing after taking this course. The research component of the course was definitely the most difficult for me, as I had not written that kind of long research paper before in high school. I learned a lot about the library's resources. It might be helpful to have Professor Lewis check our research plan of sorts, or have us turn in something so she could help us figure out what exactly it is we're trying to find in our research. At the beginning of the research process I kinda felt thrown right into the deep end of the pool. There wasn't much reading which was beneficial because it allowed for more writing practice. My skimming skills have definitely improved. The in-class workshops were amazing, I wouldn't change a thing. Oral presentations were made so easy in this class because Professor Lewis created such a supportive and open classroom culture. I loved how all of our grades were based on essays that we had unlimited revisions on. I think every class in the universe should be assessed that way. It really fosters a growth mindset. I think the structure was really good. Professor Lewis always made a point not to go on talking for too long, and we often discussed whatever we were working on in smaller breakout groups. This course made me so excited to take future courses at Dartmouth. It was the best class I took this term!\"",

She is very understanding, smart, and confident. She allowed us to step outside of the classroom to discuss our essays as groups, even telling us to get some food if needed. I was able to write essays on the topics I'm really interested in and did a presentation on one of those topics as well. All my friends who took it in the winter also loved her and her class :)\"",

For my second essay, a 5-page literature review, I ended up being forced to switch my research focus at the last minute and she worked with me to come up with a new timeline that made much more sense for where I was in the writing process. That being said, making deadlines is not difficult if you complete exercises on time, though she doesn't check these so it is easy to get behind. Getting one-on-one time with her and feedback throughout the writing process is also incredibly important, and shouldn't be hard if you go out of your way to schedule regular meetings with her. The class is very much self-directed in terms of what you choose to write about, as the first essay is a personal narrative and the other two can essentially be on any topic of your choice as long as you can justify a loose connection to the course theme. I found the most value to be in improving my writing and researching technique overall and less so in exploration of the course theme. But I love Clara, she is easy to talk to and relate to and will value your effort if you make it known.\"",

Reading are interesting are kept to a minimum in this class. That being said, she is a very harsh grader and holds extremely high standards -- there were only 2 A's on the first paper. However, she has a revision policy that allows you to revise your paper for a grade back which seems great, but between your other classes and the current essay you're working on for this class, finding time for revisions can be difficult. My writing improved in this class, but I think a freshman's writing will improve in any Writing 5 class since we are coming from high school writing. Also, Professor Lewis's directions are very vague. She says that she allows for freedom in her assignments and can give very vague directions, yet she is very specific when grading papers. She can also be inaccessible office hours wise. Mondays are appointment only and Fridays are from 12-2, but this time is flooded with tons of students so you might only get 15-20 meeting with her. This class is very writing based since she runs it like a writing workshop. She spends a lot of time in class showing us how to think when we write and the rest of the time is used to peer review.

            "review 6: \"07W with Shelby S.: I am liberal. My dislike for this class and this professor has nothing to do with the political bias Grantham brings to the table. Shelby Grantham is a substandard, close-minded professor. The way she conducts her classes actively discourages intellectual curiosity. Her opinions dominate the discussion. She fostered an environment of underperformance. Students rarely did the readings. Our classes were dull and uninspiring. Any student who dared say anything not in line with her perspective was immediately pounced on and interrogated. Gradually, we got to the point where no one spoke at all. Class became nothing more than all of us silently nodding our heads in resigned concurrence. Most offensive was the unbelievably shallow and immature analysis that Prof. Grantham offered on the texts we read. I could have learned ten times more from sparknotes. Dartmouth should be ashamed that such a poor excuse for teaching is taking place on this campus. The journal entries were a perpetual annoyance. They encouraged shallow, rushed analysis of the texts. And she was convinced that they were actually important. Really they were nothing but juvenile busy work. Prof. Grantham's editing of papers is formulaic and usually unhelpful. I feel like my writing got worse over the course of the term because I was so uninterested. This was an easy class. If you take it you will get an A or A- or B+. But it was a profound waste of time and money, an insult to meaningful thought, and the worst that Dartmouth has to offer. Avoid at all costs.\"",

While she does occasionally \"terrorize\" those who disagree with her, she usually quietly states her contrary opinions and drops the matter. I was particularly frustrated with her refusal to listen to my opinion in the beginning of the course, but toward the end I had learned how to convince her, and it was immensely satisfying. While it's also probably true that she is deeply concerned about the lobsters at the co-op (she's a vegan, and made vegan cupcakes for us on the last day of class), she is also outraged about a slew of issues that most students focus on too. Grantham is really nice in a very unusual way, and she has amazing stories to tell. She offers great suggestions about your writing if you visit her during office hours, and she will force you to think about assumptions you have regarding race and other stereotypes.

But in the end I DID learn a tremendous amount about personal prejudices, about the influences of White society on society as a whole, etc. I'd say that if you aren't a far-left hippy/feminist/communist, just avoid the class, as it's too much unnecessary frustration.

I felt like the readings were just a propogation of her ideas and we could see specific places (especially some of the first articles) where her ideas came from. They are not original (they're not bad either), but they're a little too strong and myopic for her to handle effectively. Shelby Grantham is a great person. She's compassionate and understanding about many different things, but put her in the \"pulpit\" in front of the classroom and BOOM! You're hit with a wave of anti-white, anti-male, anti-heterosexual bias. We got in a huge debate about how it's horrible that men get to work and women have to stay home taking care of children, and it was obvious that she believed that working was superior...and yet holding that belief is feeding into the white-male-dominated culture and she so aptly described it. The reading were very interesting (though somewhat redundant after a while), and the class discussions were strong. I just wish she would have let students' diverging ideas to come into the air and settle before she rips them to shreds. Take this class, but only if you're ready for it.\"",

That was the biggest problem I had with this course. Participation is encouraged, and you're always aloud to dissent, but don't expect to be taken seriously if you think differently than she does. The second biggest problem I had was that it wasn't a writing course. This course won't teach you to write a college paper. She admittedly is trying to teach something different than the usual way or writing. She requires you to write anecdotally, intuitively, and without generalization. You aren't aloud to make broad statements or come to conclusions that aren't personally grounded. Analytical writing is discouraged. You will learn some about racism, and a good deal more about Native American issues, which is the real focus of the course. This is what I did get out of taking the class. Shelby Grantham has said that all white people are racist, and all men are sexist, by virtue of the culture we grew up in. She uses the phrase \"white male dominated society\" 2 or 3 times a day. If you have a different viewpoint, DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS. Grantham is a nice person, but she's very set in her opinions, and requires you to use them in your papers. The course layout was confusing and erratic. In the midst of the term, we split into groups of three, and had to make a documentary. Come up with a topic, research it, shoot it, and edit it. Oh, and train so that we knew how to do all of that. We had about 2 and half weeks all told. The teacher tried to do this along with us, and failed at the offset. She was gracious about it after the fact, and this WAS an experiment, but it really has no place in a writing class. If you are very liberal, and you're willing to go along with the specific viewpoints I mentioned earlier (without really disagreeing), then by all means take this class. If not, find a different section.\"",

She also goes to protests in front of the White House and stands on the bridge sometimes holding \"Impeach Bush\" signs (She told us so). She is an idealist. She also exhaggerates about racism (Bandaids are racist because there is no black option). She is nice, but if you consider yourself \"white folk\" and a male, then it's not exactly helping your grade. Also, the subject of the class isn't really racism. It's Native Americans. After reading about Native American injustice for so long it gets tiresome and repulsive. The work isn't all too much. Three papers or so, about 4-5 pages each. And a final paper about 8 pages. The thing is, she's not into your writing but your \"perspective\", so I feel like I didn't really improve my writing skills. I'm sure there are much better options.\"",

It teaches you to write clearly and tightly. The class also helps you find your voice in your writing. The class makes you - know who you are - as a person.

But other than her occasional comments like \"Everyone in the world is bisexual\" that make the class rather uncomfortable, I think she was a good teacher. She went over a lot of the things that had to do with racism, but I think our class went from being about readings to being a forum through which people can discuss their experiences of racism and prejudice. (which means reading was clearly not mandatory...or even necessary) She clearly tells you about all the \"pop-quizzes you will have, and if you ask to use your books on the quizzes she will let you.

            "review 5: \"08W with Carl Thum: Okay, here's the deal. Professor Thum means well, but often doesn't come across this way. His narrow view of what constitutes good expository writing can be very abrasive to a lot of students. The first few writing assignments were very frustrating because his grades and comments seem arbitrary. However, as the course progresses you start to see what he is looking for in your writing. If you are the kind of writer who likes to write in a specific way or who has a problem with being to write in a specific way, DON'T take this course. It isn't worth it. However, if you can make minor adjustments to your writing (you only have to write one 1-2 page paper each week plus one final paper,) then this may be a good choice for you. The readings are all FANTASTIC novels and Professor Thum generally does a good job facilitating class discussions, as long as the students are willing to talk. If you choose this class just be aware that at points you will probably be frustrated by Thum's narrow aims for writing. His grading scale makes it pretty easy to get a B+/A- based on completion of assignments and attendance, but it's relatively difficult to earn an A. I personally don't regret having taken the course. I learned to look more critically at my writing and managed to keep my own style while also incorporating what I think Thum was looking for. Plus, I read six outstanding novels I had always wanted to read.\"",
            "review 6: \"08F with Carl Thum: I took this class because the course description said it would focus on improving my analytical writing, and that was exactly what it did. Writing a paper every week helped me overcome my writer's block. By seeing Professor Thum after every paper and following his advice to the best of my ability, I have greatly improved the clarity of my writing. The concepts that Professor Thum is trying to teach in this class are subtle, and difficult to master even when you understand them, but you are not penalized for failing to implement them. As Professor Thum said himself, writing is a skill that takes years to develop and mature. Because of this, all papers are graded based on a check-minus, check, check plus system. A check represents anything from a mediocre paper to a good one. A check minus is unacceptable, and you will be asked to write it again (but as long as you do, your grade will not suffer). A check plus is only for an exceptional paper. Don't expect to get a check plus, and don't freak out about not getting one. You can still get an A even if you never write a check plus paper. Finally, a note on Professor Thum. He is an interesting person whom I had the good fortune to get to know fairly well (which I would highly advise doing). I expect he will be a good friend for much of my Dartmouth career. My one complaint is this: the way the class is structured, students lead all of the discussions and do their best to explore and understand the texts in a round table fashion. This is great for learning to speak up in class, but it doesn't make any use of Professor Thum's P.H.D. I think it would have been better if he had done more to guide the class discussions, or at least contribute a little bit of his expert analysis to really show us how rich the texts were. In short, I enjoyed this class, and while it wasn't the most fun in the world, I expect I will be feeling its benefits for years into the future.

(The rallying cry is \"So what?\") He also promotes a very simple, clear, almost utilitarian style of writing; the comment \"narrow\" ubiquitous on nearly all of my papers. That being said, the grade in this class is based mainly on participation and timely completion of assignments (read: if you do the work, get it in on time, and contribute, you will still get a decent grade). This egalitarian grading sits well with me, and, although I never felt as though I completely grasped Thum's ultimate stylistic concept, I was still recognized for the work I put in.

Professor Thum has a very specific set of things he wants to see in your writing, and you basically have to mold your writing to fit exactly what he wants. That isn't easy to do though, even if you think you understand what he wants, and he often gives sort of contradictory or unhelpful feedback. Thum is a nice guy though, and cares about his students. He is a busy guy (he's also the director of the ASC) so even though he says he's available to meet with you anytime to discuss you writing, that isn't exactly how it is. The readings are the best part of the class in my opinion. We read interesting books, and I'm glad I took this class just so I got to read those books. If you have to take Writing 5, this class isn't the worst one, and I haven't heard of any that were that amazing, so you really just have to get through this graduation requirement.\"",

Prof. Thum was really into focused and concise papers, but he was never really able to explain how to accomplish what he was looking for. No matter how much time (or how little time) I spent on the weekly 2page paper, I always got the same grade and same comments. I also did not like the reading selection and we went through a new book nearly every week, which was not particularly enjoyable. The only redeeming part of this class was the end when we wrote our final research papers. We got to choose our own book and topic, which was really nice. I probably wouldn't take another class w/ Thum, but the experience was good, since some other profs are like him and now I know how to deal better.\"",

Professor Carl Thum, however, wasn't that easy going. He was very determined in his views, both on writing in general and the literary interpretations of the books. He didn't like hearing opinions that went against his and usually shot them down. He strictly restricted the writing style we should use in our weekly papers. At this point, I think I'm pretty brainwashed of his method.\"",

You have to write a 2 pg paper every week, but for the most part it's just for a completion grade, and there isn't a final. Most of the class is just showing up and doing your work.

We had a wide variety of assignments, from group projects to short casual responses to formal essays to journal entries. We presented a couple orally. Always had enough time for the assignments. I got the feeling that there was a bigger task of the class than to teach us to write. Professor: Class was always intriguing and exciting. Prof O seemed like it was his goal to give us a life lesson, not just a writing class. His passion for the themes of the book we read (things like mindfulness and self introspection) was perfect for me, and I liked the idea that what we were doing was just a class, but what we were learning could be applied to so much more. We did mindfulness exercises and meditations, and we even covered a bit of environmentalism. Workload: Evenly spaced, manageable. Tasks were clear, suggestions for improvement were helpful, option to revise was useful.\"",

Professor Osborne is an exceptional teacher. He is enthusiastic during class, very personable, and also willing to be flexible when it comes to deadlines for assignments. He doesn't grade too harshly, but he does really \"push\" you to expand on all your thoughts in your writing, constantly asking \"why this?\" and \"why that?\" You are allowed to rewrite all of your papers if you want to, which is nice. Also, Osborne really encourages the students in the class to get to know each other, so there was a lot of group work. Overall, I am super glad that I chose this course for Writing 5. It was definitely worthwhile.\"",

I can definitely say i've never delved into a book as much as we did with the snow leopard. the book inspired me in a lot of ways too, its a neat story and an intriguing writing style. all i can say is that this is a fantastic writing 5 class and i haven't found someone who got half as much out of their writing 5 class as i got out of this one.\"",

            "review 8: \"07F with Terry Osborne: Professor Osborne was an amazing teacher who putted forth the effort to engage classroom discussions on a topic that was, to me at least, unconventional. I think the true value of this class however was that he facilitated me with the skills necessary to better my writing - using the library system, taking advantage of RWIT, taking advantage of the class RWIT tutor that comes around every now and then...I went from what looked like a B- in the course early on, to an A- at the end - with the potential for an A had I decided to rewrite one of my papers that was graded a B- (but didn't, due to lack of time). Professor Osborne gave everybody ample opportunity to improve their skills. I think as long as you put in the effort necessary, you can get a good grade with Osborne. He was really relaxed about deadlines, and a few in the class actually took advantage of this observation to take extra time to write their papers. You can even tell the professor that the paper you're handing in is meant to be a draft - ON the day when that same paper is supposed to be due. Grades were based on 4 papers (including the final paper) and yes - that was about it. There were also a series of journals that the professor wanted you to write and to have certain ones handed in for a grade, but a lot of the students chose not to write the optional ones - which ended up not being a big deal. There are several problems with Osborne's pedagogy: It was always the same people discussing the readings, and he never actually encouraged the quieter students to speak up - which I suppose is good, since then you didn't have to do the readings AT ALL to do very well for yourself in the class. This gets to another major point. Even though there was minimal reading in the class (one book, and a bunch of handouts, READ: ONE 300 page book) a lot of people still avoided them. Looking through the essay examples - I couldn't blame them. You could have done very little actual reading in the class, and still have done very well. Our 4 assignments were, a Personal Narrative (which obviously had nothing to do with the reading), a Research Paper (which had very little to do with the readings - as long as you extracted arbitrary points from the text, then you were fine), a Textual Analysis Paper (this actually had quite a bit to do with the reading and hence, was probably why everyone did relatively poorly on that), and a Final Paper combining all of the methods we used to approach the other ones. Honestly, there's no reason not to do well in this class, as long as you take advantage of what Osborne's giving to you. If you don't - which sadly, a lot of people did not - then well, I can't really pat you on the back there. I'm a little disappointed that a lot of the Writing wasn't connected explicitly to the reading, but I still think Osborne did a great job in teaching us how to take advantage of the resources to write \"at Dartmouth.\"\"",

Only one book, Matthiessen's \"The Snow Leopard,\" and lots of additional handouts and course reader on different aspects of the book (Buddhism reading, Nepal). This means liking that one book is very important to the level of enjoyment you get from the course. Good prof. (take advantage of office hours!), but if I could do it over, I would have picked a different Writing 5 section--one with books and a topic I would have been more interested in. Unfortunately, I also feel like I didn't learn very much about college writing from the course. WARNING if you are hesitant about your interest in travel memoir/nature: Although we were exposed to four different writing structures (Personal Narrative, Exploratory, Argumentative Analysis, and a Synthesis combining all of the other three), it becomes very trying to keep writing quality papers about the same book that you don't like. There is a lot of writing, and the prof. is a critical grader. My impression is that even Krakauer fans/Buddhism enthusiasts in the class became bored with \"The Snow Leopard,\" which you will be asked to re-read a couple times. Again, I think Prof. Osborne is an excellent lecturer and I'm glad I got to know him a little, but this is a case where the subject of the course is more important than the quality of the prof.

The people who got the best grades in this course (A-/B+) were people who sucked at writing in the beginning, and made a moderate improvement by doing what she tells you to do... even though these things will not necessarily make you a better writer. She gripes about every little thing in every essay that you write. In the end, you don't end up a better writer, but you are certainly much more anxious before turning in an assignment. Her lectures are almost universally uninteresting. Maybe it's because all of the readings were uninteresting as well. All of the books (with the exception of Saul Williams) were girly books about immigrants. They were books that would be great for a book club of middle-aged mothers, but horrible for a college writing class. If you enjoy putting a lot of work into uninteresting essays about uninteresting books, and then turning them in to an uninteresting teacher, who will give you bad criticisms, and then probably give you a bad grade..... then this is the class for you. On the upside, there is one book that is actually an excellent piece of literature: \",said the Shotgun to the head\" by Saul Williams. It is extremely philosophical and passionate and even musical. Of course, it is so philosophical, and so uninhibited by traditional writing conventions, that Prof. Mackin has NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT!!! She pretty much just reads parts and then asks your opinion.

Despite this, she is a wonderfully nice person and her comments are strictly business. Her workload was very reasonable for the goal we were trying to accomplish:Writing a 3-5 page paper every week to improve our writing. The only real downside of this course was the vagueness of the assignments. She makes a point of saying, \"Okay, read this book, write a paper, GO!\" Without giving you a topic. This is a dramatic change from high school and sometimes difficult. That said, it was probably one of the best aspects of the class.

The larger assignments - there is a huge difference between B+ and A- work, and it's very unlikely you'll get an A (though it is possible). I think this course had more work than most other Writ 5 courses because of the in-class essay prep. There were about 100 pages of reading in between classes, along with prep for 3 essay questions for the next in-class essay (he'd pick one of the questions for you to answer in 15 minutes), and then also whatever work was necessary to be done for that week's paper. Even though this class was tough, I feel like I got a lot from it. My writing improved, and Nichols got me to push myself as a writer and a thinker. I recommend it if you aren't the kind of student that worries about your GPA.\"",
            "review 4: \"09F with William Nichols: The course description definitely misled me. I thought this class would be mostly about architecture, and the first couple classes were indeed about architecture, but then we moved on to nature, nature, and more nature. And then some more nature. Class discussions, which were the bulk of this class, since Professor Nichols doesn't really lecture, got pretty repetitive and requires you to spend a lot of time outside of class interpreting the readings and going over study questions. There is an in-class essay at the beginning of every class, but fortunately, Professor Nichols thinks that students' in-class writing is brilliant, so with a little effort, you'll get an OK+ or an A. Speaking of which, Nichols does not give letter grades, he gives an OK-, an OK, an OK +, or an A. He himself says that A's are rare, and they very much are. He is a tough grader, so worrying about your GPA will stress you out. If you are bothered by not having letter grades to gauge yourself on, I recommend you take a different course. However, essays do get letter grades, but if it's an A you want, you won't be too happy. An important point: one of the essays more or less requires you go to Rauner for research, and it was an excellent experience. You must learn to use the library system and this assignment is a good introduction to it. Professor Nichols is a great guy, and undestands that 2A's can get long, so he often brings snacks and homebaked goods for students to enjoy during break. He is really nice, and can crack a few jokes in class. If you are into nature, hiking and are generally a pretty crunchy person, you will have a lot to share with Nichols and he'll probably like you more. Not that he won't like you otherwise, but you'll probably have more to talk about with him and connect better. Not being a vigorous tree-hugger myself, I found the readings boring and the discussions dispassionate. My writing did not improve, and I feel I would have gotten more out of another writing 5 class. There were 5 essays and then a final portfolio that was your past revised essays and some revised in-class writing (so be sure to save those!).\"",

The writing assignments in this class were pretty cool and I thought easy to write. In class was basically just a discussion partly led by Nichols and partly by the students. The discussions usually were pretty lively and covered a lot of controversial topics. All in all I enjoyed the class a lot and feel like my writing improved over the term.\"",
            "review 6: \"08W with William Nichols: Prof. William Nichols has a very student-orientated way of teaching. He assigns students to panels of three at the beginning of the term. Panels lead the discussion group for a good half of the class, but really, it's the talkers that run the discussion. At the beginning of the course, I learned lots of new things: cars are the cancer of society, technology is , and my bonsai tree is actually a redwood. After, that, it shifted towards the commercial aspects of society, applying the same ideas to new planes. Personally, I found the entire thing to be pretty dull, although I'm not a fan of English classes in the first place. I also had to write six essays plus a final paper for this class. Before you screech out in brain-ablating agony however, just know that these papers only had to be around three pages, and the final paper is just a revision of several of the previous essays. If you decide to take this class, just make sure you keep up with the reading and speak up during class. I didn't feel like my writing improved by a whole lot, and I didn't really like this course, but I'm sure it could've been worse. And by \"it\" I mean my grade and by \"worse\" I mean higher.\"",

The discussion was interesting, though for the most part there wasn't much diversity of thought in the class. He definitely takes a step back and lets the class run itself, which can lead to a lot of dead ends, but also to some stimulating discussion. Though his comments on papers didn't help me become a better writer, we got to evaluate the papers of our peers which was helpful. He sent one essay to a friend of his who's an editor at Newsweek and let the class see the line edit which was cool. Overall, a good class and worth taking if you're interested in economic growth(modern America) and its effect on nature and environmentalism.\"",

Every class started with an in-class essay about the previous night's reading, which was graded...so not always fun, if you had no idea what you read. The readings included works by Thoreau, McKibben, and some other random people. The class was really laid back, which I liked a lot, considering thatI didn't have a lot to say about nature, since I'm really not into the whole nature scene.\"",

You have to be interested in talking about nature and environnments in order to like this course. Classes are more like discussions than lectures. If you think that talking about nature is boring, this is not a good choice. I thought it would be boring.. But if you haven't thought about what nature means, it can be an interesting course. Personally, I really liked the readings. Getting an A is hard in this class, but not impossible. He gives many B+.. Some people got pissed b/c they could not make A s in this course.. Personally, I learned a lot in this class. In terms of improving my writing skill, I think I got a lot out of taking this course. Because you have to write A LOT !!

He is so chill and super helpful at improving your writing. You get a ton of flexibility to choose what you want to write about and he gives you great feedback and allows unlimited revision even after the \"final\" draft. He values concise writing and leaning heavily on good sources with specific details throughout the essay. I don't know how a writing 5 could really be better or easier than this class. Our only assignments were the essays (a few other tiny assignments). Take this class, it is truly an ideal writing 5.\"",
            "review 2: \"22W with William Craig: \"Reviewing Ourselves: Critical Writing and Personal Values\": Definitely on the easier side of the Writing 5's. Grading is 30% participation (in-class discussion of texts and themes, Style concepts, in-class writing, presentations, peer workshops and editing), 10% formative assignments (Informal/reaction writing such as personal experience, reading reactions, generative prompts), 15% essay #1 (3-5 pages responding to a series of short essays on criticism), 20% essay #2 (4-6 pages discussing any piece of art you want), and 25% essay #3 (12+ pages on literally any defensible topic you want.) As mentioned in other reviews, the ability to write about almost anything you want on the essays is a big plus. Very little reading, too -- the required reading is pretty much just the essays for Essay #1, and then some random book that is only used on one small formative assignment. I'm not sure what to think about Professor Craig's grading -- he definitely does end up giving high grades, but he also has high (or perhaps arbitrary) standards. I distinctly remember him completely trashing one of my drafts for Essay #1, requiring me to completely rewrite half of it. In particular, you're pretty much banned from using adverbs and \"is + [verb]\" constructions. You also can't use pronouns, because apparently they're \"vague\"; you have to name the subject explicitly, even if it ends up being awkward because you used the name of the subject multiple times in quick succession. But I guess all that matters in the end is the grade you get, and since he ends up giving high grades, then, well... \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Most of the learning comes from revising your essays. You don't really learn that much when in-person in class. There are some interesting class discussions in the beginning of the class, but those are replaced with review presentations (presenting a review of a movie/book/piece of art/etc.) and style presentations (presenting a chapter of the Style book.) In particular, the style presentations are the method in which the writing principles are taught, which you don't actually learn that much from. You also spend a lot of time peer editing, which, while still helpful to some degree, isn't an efficient use of time. (But I'm pretty sure every writing 5 leans heavily into peer editing, so not sure you can avoid it.) It's important to note that this term, Professor Craig had a lot of personal issues going on, so there was definitely some disorganization in the class. In particular, the Canvas was a mess and I never ended up getting feedback on my second and third essays (even though he promised that he would provide feedback.) Still, something perhaps to keep in mind. Despite the above complaints, Writing 5 with Craig is the move. There might be an easier Writing 5 (Future of Foods maybe?) but it probably isn't worth fighting/searching for. Sign up for Craig, get in with room to spare (because most people see \"reviewing art\" and chicken out by topic alone) and laugh while everyone else fights for the scraps during add/drop.\"",

The mandatory conferences with him while drafting each of the essays in the class were very useful, and it's really impressive how quickly he can go through your draft and point out the big problems. He's very amiable and a pretty easy grader on the papers as well. The class structure, however, is really fast and loose. You can pretty much ignore the syllabus from day one (we only ever did like half of the posted assignments in Canvas, which was kind of weird but I'm thankful because I had a pretty stacked term and those assignments would have killed me dead). The Style textbook is a great resource but can lead to overthinking your drafts if you're not careful, and the other two books were not particularly interesting to me and only used once each. Essay topics were enjoyable - one on critical ideals, one on a piece of art from the Hood, and one on literally anything as long it was tangentially humanities-related. Overall, atypical is probably the best word to describe the course.\"",

He has high standards for sure, but if you are willing to improve and show diligence, he will give a high grade. I agree with the previous comments about Canvas being disorganized, but at least the bigger assignments (i.e. papers and drafts) were covered and there wasn't any huge miss. I also agree that going for his class IS THE MOVE - aside from prof being super nice/doable workload, too many people will be scrambling for more popular writing 5 classes, so you'll probably not end up getting in. The only thing I do not completely agree with the previous comments is, I believe one will learn a lot in his class. It may not always be about writing, though. Most of the times Prof Craig's take on philosophical thoughts and things about life in general will be equally thought-provoking. Everything from Prof Craig is authentic, smart, well-phrased, and will inspire thoughts. He respects your opinions and ideas, and will help you develop your framework for the last big essay, and point you in promising directions.

Initially, from the topics of the papers and the discussion we were focusing around in academic papers for class, it felt as though my papers had be to of a caliber that I was not capable of producing with no previous knowledge in philosophy or formal academic writing. But by the end of the term it was clear that the extremely implicit but overarching goal of the class was to improve our own levels of writing. There is a moderate amount of readings in the class. Maybe 30 pages per class. The readings are usually essays and papers written by philosophers, formally presenting and evaluating philosophical principles that are concerned with climate change. I think it is pretty necessary to do the readings to engage with the lessons and write the papers. The workload is definitely reasonable in my opinion. We only used 1 X hour the whole term, which is different than what he states in the class description. Professor Binkoski is a super understanding and kind person. He teaches very clear and is incredibly organized: the entirety of our syllabus, assignments and due dates for them, was on Canvas before even starting the term. He makes moral philosophy very approachable and gives very specific feedback about your writing.\"",
            "review 12: \"20W with James Binkoski: I took 'What is Knowledge?'. Awesome class! Definitely changed my style of thinking, as we learned very rigorous methods of argumentation and technical writing. Binkoski makes it clear that he holds opinions on the issues we touch on, but he is very open to in class discussion and helps students sort through their thoughts. He is a very smart philosophy type. Papers are long and are on rather difficult topics, but they are a good challenge which allows you to think critically about some deep issues. Highly recommend this class for a very interesting writing 5 that will introduce you to some serious philosophy.\"",
            "review 13: \"20F with James Binkoski: His section on the Ethics of Climate Change was great. It's not a ton of work: probably ~50 pages of academic reading a week and 3 papers total (with the longest being 10-12 pages double-spaced). If you're passionate about climate change, climate policy, climate justice, and/or environmental philosophy in general, you'll like the content. The hardest part of this course for me was reading and understanding some of the complicated philosophy papers, but fortunately Binkoski always clarifies them and explains them more simply in his lectures and in his discussions. The papers aren't too bad: you can easily get a feel for how Binkoski grades, so as long as you focus on making a no-bs paper with good, understandable arguments, you'll get high grades on them. Even with the papers, the class wasn't a terrible time commitment. Writing the papers is time-consuming but you get a lot of time to do them and re-edit them. I would definitely recommend this section of Writing 5 if it's available, but don't be sad if you don't get in because this term there were like 60 people who signed up and only 16 got in.\"",

She gives some good tips on how to write more concisely. However, when she marks the papers, she really hammers you on those specific mistakes about conciseness (especially the verb 'to be') but doesn't seem to make many other suggestions about how to improve your overall writing style. So by the end of the term, I felt my writing had not changed very much at all, except that it eliminated 'to be'. Sears marks hard, but the marks did seem to rise as the course progressed, though I not sure it was because the writing actually improved. The topic of this class was war. The reading selections were interesting, but seemed somewhat redundant. We looked at the Holocaust during WWII, the Bosnian war, and the Iraq war. The first two readings were very good, the third was quite disappointing. Two of the three novels were from the perspective of journalists, so given the scope of the topic - war, the class had the potential to be a bit better and more diverse.

In terms of content, the class was definitely interesting. Pay attention to what Sears says about eliminating 'to be', be intentional about using tools like emphasis, repetition, metaphors, periodic sentences etc. Also be original with your theses - these are the things that will prop your grade up.

You get to go to the Rauner Library and then you do a presentation and paper on an artifact that you are assigned. In the beginning, I wasn't sure how I was going to make a presentation with my partner and write a paper on this artifact. However, with the help of Professor Palmer and Mr. Carini, you piece together information on your artifact and get a really good understanding of your artifact and its background.

There is a decent amount of work in the beginning, but by the end there is almost none. I went through the entire term, not getting back a single grade. I wrote like 7 papers and got none back, so I have no idea where I stand right now. The median grade last time she taught it was an A, so hopefully I'll be fine.

It was still interesting to listen to the discussion, though, and helped me formulate my thoughts for the writing pieces. The readings themselves were pretty dull, but the prof made it really approachable. If I remember right, we handed in 7 papers, half of them just 1 page responses. Only three papers were marked: a 1-page response to a reading on John S. Mill, a 3-page response to a reading on Rousseau, and an 8-page research paper based on a real artifact stored in Rauner Archives. The first was marked pretty harshly, but was diagnostic. She marked the other two very generously. I got an A despite not contributing much to the class discussion, though I did make sure my voice was heard in my writing and in one of the one-on-one sessions with her.

The grading is generous, too, and the lectures pretty interesting. The only drawbacks are the readings, which were often pretty boring, and the lack of organization.

He focuses heavily (emphasize again, heavily) on mechanical aspects of writing, and focuses very little on the actual content of your work. He also has a preconceived notion on what you (the student) should get from a text, and if you say different, you're wrong. Also, don't expect a warm greeting during office hours. It often felt like he had better things to do, and wasn't that helpful. The prof in general will restrict any creative or adventurous writing styles, keeping you to a very strict format.

The topics were not that hard at all. One thing I disliked about the class is that she talked for the entire time about her thoughts and opinions. And i t was not really a safe space for students to present their own ideas since she would just automatically refute them. Even though the topics were about our OWN interpretation of ancient philosophy topics.\"",
            "review 4: \"20W with Deanne Harper: I chose this class for the topic (Pursuit of Happiness), and I have never regretted it. I found this course challenging even coming from an AP English background, though I learned a lot about good writing and about happiness itself. The course is divided into three parts, each investigating a major topic in happiness: what is happiness, the science of happiness, and who deserves happiness. The papers get progressively longer (1500-2000, 2000-2500, 2500-3000), and Harper pushes your writing to incorporate more sophisticated philosophical arguments by citing specific details of the readings. She graded papers more harshly than I thought, though her rubric was clear, and you can earn a lot of completion points, resulting in the A median for 20W. I would have preferred if she gave more specific feedback on the second and third papers. She ran into time constraints so I only received a final score for each paper. She still provided thorough feedback on each essay draft (revised after a peer-review process). Most of her feedback was on the phone because she only comes to campus twice a week for class (she lives in MA so she drives back and forth each time). The presentation/portfolio is also a good 25% cushion for your grade (everyone except 1 person got 100%), and it's an opportunity for you to not just talk about your writing but also about yourself. Overall a great class!\"",
            "review 5: \"20F with Deanne Harper: Very interesting topic, and good interesting class. The readings can be dense, but manageable work load. She is a hard grader and can be a bit harsh when reviewing your work. If you are already a good writer and you're engaged in class you will get a high A. If however you are more like myself, and am not the best writer (probably should've take Writing 2-3) you can do all the readings, be extremely engaged in class, make a million revisions to your papers and barely manage to get a a B-. A lot of this class assumes you already know how to write well, it doesn't really teach you how to be a BETTER writer just how to write in the formats desired, which IS valueable and you will learn a lot, but if you struggle with writing this class will likely be very disheartening.\"",

The topic seems interesting and some of the reading really did change the way I viewed happiness and how I live my life but on the other hand after 10 weeks it is incredibly monotonous and exhausting to be thinking about. In general I think this class was not great on zoom (Harper talking for 2 hours straight or reallllly long breakout rooms) and I can see how nice and personable she would be in person. She is an easy grader for sure (some of the essays I wrote were definitely not my best but still got A's) and gives a ton of points for completion.

I went to numerous office hours and put in tons of work into the class. However, after reassuring me that my paper was really well done and that I should no longer put in any more effort, she went on to give me an A-, which was below the class' average. Additionally, she gets distracted so easily during class and ends up talking about something completely irrelevant the majority of the time. Also, each time I went for office hours, she gave advice that contradicted those she gave from the previous office hours. Would not recommend this class.\"",

That being said, do the readings and show up prepared to class. They're short and range from very dry to actually pretty interesting. Just do them. The papers are simple, but I found the topic pretty complex. However, Harper gives her students an extremely broad range of ways to write. All you have to do is use sources in a thoughtful way and you're good to go. You could literally take any paper in any direction and as long as you make your point, she'll respect it. Classes were enjoyable if you have talkative peers. Harper literally walks into class and goes, \"so what do you guys want to talk about today?\" and it goes from there. Have fun.

            "review 11: \"18F with Deanne Harper: The Pursuit of Happiness. I recommend for sure. Harper wants you to become a better writer, and she wants you to realize that currently, you are not the best writer you can be. I think some students entered her class with the attitude that they're already fantastic writers, and so, they struggled with her critiques. Harper really just wants you to grow as a student and a writer and to realize that there is room to grow always. Every day, Harper walks into class and says \"what do you want to talk about today?\" The class is extremely discussion focused, based on many readings about happiness. Most of the readings are actually pretty interesting, and they're all short, too (most were 3-8 pages, with the longest being around 20). While Harper does not spend too much time on actual rules of writing, she really individualizes her teaching during office hours. Harper offers to meet with students at basically any time of the day, and really encourages students to meet with her as often as they need. During her office hours, Harper focuses on where you specifically struggle as a writer. There were three major papers in this class, all needing a minimum of 2500 words. Each paper had two rough drafts that would be peer edited by two people each, and Harper would read the second draft and offer feedback in a mandatory individual meeting, too. Before that mandatory meeting before each final draft, she would encourage students to meet with her anyways, and would often give good feedback as well. During class discussions, Harper really tries to let the students lead discussions. She offers thoughts, too, but definitely tries to leave it up to the students. The class will be awkward if you have a group of people that don't like to talk at all. It will be very interesting if the students enjoy discussing the topic. Harper was not gracious about giving A's, but her rubric was very clear. Not a layup, but I don't think that there are very many writing 5 layups. This was an enjoyable class for me. Not my favorite, but definitely better than some of the writing 5s I've heard about. I feel very improved as a writer and much more confident, and I know a ton about happiness now.\""

The way Professor Grushina cares about class discussions isn't comparable to the high energy passion that some Writing 5 professors have. Instead, she has a laid-back and tempered attitude that, while great for my tastes, can be a hit or miss for some people. In class, discussions can range from the philosophical to the casual, but what you learn comes largely from the assigned readings. Don't do them and it won't be the end of the world, but without them, you might find class time to be more filler-like than engaging. Again, this class is what you make of it.

For example, a rough draft would be due on Monday (to be posted on Blackboard), then you and your peers would have to read over and critique each other's papers by Wednesday, and then the final draft would be due Friday. One thing that you might find odd at first was that the papers were due by 2 AM on the designated days. However, this is because Prof Luxon doesn't want his students pulling all-nighters. But if you are a procrastinator and tend to pull all-nighters to finish a paper, that's okay too. He's very lenient about the 2 AM due time. Basically, if you get the paper posted before class time the next day, you should be fine. Also, he wants you to think more critically, so he often does not give essay topics; he wants you to come up with your own which is, at times, quite a challenge. But I can honestly say it helps you become a better thinker and writer. The class itself was very interesting, and Prof Luxon likes to give his own interpretation of the texts which are also quite interesting. He likes to play \"guess what's on the teacher's mind\" a lot; he even says that a lot in class. So, say you can't come up with an essay topic...he loves it if you write what he wants to hear, or what was on his mind. All in all, the class was fairly easy.

Professor Donahue was amazing, she helped me progress and a writer so much. I feel like I understand writing better, have a broader range of skills, am more efficient at writing and am able to produce a better final product. The most helpful aspect of her teaching was the individual conferences that she held outside of class. For every major paper, she critiqued a draft and meet with each student. She made a lot of comments on the draft and was really great at answering questions. Also, if you worked hard to make the changes that she suggested, she would reward you with a good grade.

One criticism I have regarding her teaching is though I learned a lot about art history from Carroll, I don't feel her comments were aimed at improving writing skills. She critiqued papers as an art professor, marking down for missing a subtle angle of artistic interpretation rather than for grammatical or structural errors.

            "review 4: \"07F with Edmund V.: This course focused on Utopias and the Pastoral image. We spent the first two weeks reading pastoral poems because of a delay with a book order. We then went on to read Utopia,The Tempest, Arcadia, Brave New World, Herland, The Handmaid's Tale, and Philadelphia Fire at about a book per week. Unfortunatly, the last 3 weeks of the course dealt with the longer/deeper novels so those weeks were the toughest. Before/After each book he would also lecture about the historical perspective of each play/book. I liked the topics that we discussed about in class. For the first half of the class we would break up into smaller groups and work on tracing a topic or theme in the book and then present it to the class. Then later on we stopped and just had in class discussions. We watched some video clips and discussed pieces of artwork relevant to the novels. The day/weekend before a book is supposed to be read we normally had a Blackboard submission to a question he asked. We had 3 essays with about 1.5 weeks to write them, and our final 4th essay was a revision of any of our previous 3 essays with an extension of 2 journal articles. I would suggest being an active participant in the class discussions since it is 20% of your grade. I'm not sure what grade I got at this point, but I think my grade will go down most likely because of my lack of class participation. Prof. Campos seems to be very nice when grading your essays. You meet with him at least once to discuss your essay topic before you write it and again when he discusses your grade and essay. He also passed around 4 sample student excerpts to peer review in class and discuss the good writing techniques used. I'm not sure how much my writing improved overall but I did learn some habits that are common in secondary school, that are bad in college esp with my introduction, conclusion, and thesis statements. I would recommend any course taught by Prof. Campos\"",

He's very approachable outside of class and will take as much time to go over your paper with you as you desire. Class discussions were usually interesting and peppered with parallels to bad B-movies, which did help alleviate the dullness that inevitably came when Edmund was unsure about where to direct our analyses of the works. Also noteworthy was the lack of paper prompts: you will like this class a lot if you are good at taking initiative on theses, but if like me you have trouble deciding what to write about, prepare to spend a lot of time scratching your head and procrastinating. The books were mostly enjoyable; however, there were a few too many. I felt that I spent a disproportionate amount of time reading as opposed to writing, and as a consequence, never really improved my writing over the term. Anyway, take this course if you're more into literature than reworking your writing style and if you're self-motivated enough to make use of the open forum that is undirected class discussion and paper topic choice.\"",

Furthermore, there is a lot of busy work that really doesn't connect.

Now that I'm done, I can safely that while relatively easy (you will probably get an A or A-), this class was pretty heavy, especially towards the end. The professor is such a nice dude. He's really personable and funny, and honestly quite random (he'd start singing class in sometimes, literally for no reason). Still, the class itself is sort of a train wreck. It's not organized in the best manner, and the major assignments are kind of stupid. There are three major projects: a concept autobiography (basically a personal essay/narrative), a campus ethnography (a qualitative study of something diversity-related at Dartmouth), and a final research paper. In addition to that, there are 6 weekly commentaries (roughly 2 pages) answering a prompt on the readings he assigns every week. The readings itself were meh... We had some really interesting Dartmouth related ones about coeducation and diversity at Dartmouth that were pretty wild (like sketchy stuff about Dartmouth history the school probably doesn't want you to know). The other readings about how to write and shit were stupid honestly. The prompts for all the assignments were weirdly worded, probably because Prof. Doyin just wanted to sound more \"nuanced\" and \"complex;\" instead, he confused himself and the students. In the beginning, we had pretty good discussions in class about the readings, but then each class just became Doyin talking for two straight hours about the syllabus for that day or the prompt of whatever future project we were working on. It was ridiculous. I think all of the people in the class would do anything but pay attention because this man would just keep talking and talking and talking. Like I would eat lunch, clean my room, paint my nails, do laundry, and so may other things during class and still not miss a single ounce of valuable information... Still, once the two or three last weeks of the term came around, we were all super overwhelmed (OverWhelMeD) with revisions for a ton of shit he hadn't mentioned before, as well as the stupid portfolio. Overall, he's a nice guy, he means well (literally bought us Lou's donuts), but not a great prof. His class could use more structure.

The projects and writing assignments don't do much to enhance your understanding of anything and the readings are very tedious. Some of the readings were interesting and informative in the beginning, but still lengthy. His advise on essay revisions actually makes them worse. This was a terrible introduction into college writing, and now I don't know what other writing professors expect in terms of quality. I absolutely do not recommend this class.

With that, the course does get pretty interesting half way through. The topic is super obscure. Frankly, I don't think anybody really got what \"performitivity\" or \"identification\" and what not were. The class has really good literature like M.Butterfly, but the secondary reading like Judith Butler can be a total drag. Expect to read a lot of complicated, wordy, obscure and random readings about identity formation, theatere and performance. I really didn't know what half the readings were saying. Nevertheless, this leads to some interesting discussions because the topic and material lends to no \"right answer\". Talk as much as you can. She grades hard on the first essay, but after that if you apply the Butler stuff and put effort into the essay (CLEAR THESIS), you are golden. Taking a feminist approach is always a plus. In comparison to a lot of other Writing 5's this one is laid back and manageable. There isn't that much reading and you can get away with not doing it if you wanted to. She is a fair grader after the first essay and sparking is fun. Colbert is nice and she is passionate about the topic and cares about the students. Will you be a better writer after this?

No one likes it, switch out ASAP This class feels like hell. First of all, it has a really really hard median - the highest grade anyone has received is an A-, and the median is a low B. Murphy has stated multiple times that he does not believe in giving As to freshmen. Now for the class - we are not allowed to discuss anything not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, which according to Murphy includes but is not limited to homosexuality, feminism, abortion, or environmentalism. Murphy really emphasizes using a specific translation of the Bible (the New standard revised edition if that means anything) so we were not allowed to cite any other translations or look at the original greek and Hebrew to see if there were other possible meanings. this does not stop him from doing this, however. If he disagrees with the translation he will give a long lecture on why his interpretation is better (possible topics include his preference between the words nakedness and nudity or a jail vs a prison) even if the text is objectively refuting his claim. He also will make Hitler references more often than anyone was comfortable with. he will make statements about mental health and school shootings that are ... iffy at best. He is a staunch catholic and lets his beliefs influence his grading. We discovered that the best way to pass this class was to write only points that he agreed with in our essays, which led to a rather infuriating essay-writing process.

When he does talk, he drops some ridiculously questionable comment that has little biblical support.

Don't take this class if you can help it, he told us after add/drop ended that no one in the class would be receiving an A, which was diabolical.

Murphy rarely gives higher than a B on any assignment (despite his appraising comments on your essays) and grades your essay drafts to factor into your final grade. His theory of revision reflects this: your first (graded) draft should be nearly perfect, and subsequent revisions should rearrange and restructure your essay to convert it into something entirely different. I do not feel my effort in this course correlated with my grades. No matter how much effort you put into revisions, he will only raise your grade by half a letter (if at all); for instance, I consistently got a grade of a B- on my first drafts, and would only get a B on the final versions of the papers. This class has the lowest median grade out of all the Writing 5 courses, and despite the intrigue and seminar-type discussions we had, I would not recommend this class.\"",

This might seem daunting, but you build up to the term paper with the two 8-10 page papers. You end up writing maybe another page or two for the term paper in addition to the earlier papers. It's definitely a plus if you've read the Bible (or parts of it) before. I liked the course. It has a somewhat clickbait-y title (Sex and Violence in the Bible) but we do talk about those things (and others) on a much more philosophical level than a religious level in class.

He is incredibly intelligent and very enthusiastic, often going into stories in class and giving really dramatic entrances to guest speakers. This keeps the class fun, though. Professor Rezvani is great at making sure everyone is on the same page in class discussions, which comprise most of the in-class work, as there is not a ton of lecture. The most important trait of Rezvani to understand is that he is very specific and is not willing to call you out point blank if you make a strawman's argument or try to squeak by weakly on an assignment.

We got feedback from her, our peers, and other people, too. Fieldtrips to CRREL, Hood Museum, Rauner special collections, and exhibitions in the library. I learned a lot about what this campus has to offer in terms of resources and just plain cool stuff. Prof. Stuckenberger is so knowledgeable, high-energy, and has a great balance between challenging and helping students. Very accessible out of class. Definitely recommend taking a course with her.

It's marketed as a meme class, but it's really a class about the philosophy of aesthetic judgement. You spend the first half of the course reading Kant's Analytic of the Beautiful, and discuss it in depth. You then read other pieces on other aesthetic terms, which are really hard to to follow. The final is an essay about whether or not \"relatability\" is an aesthetic judgement. You can write the paper through any frame that you'd like, so you have a lot of control over what the paper is. That being said, you have to formulate all of the ideas and connections yourself, which can be (should be if you want a good grade) pretty complex. This class is good for people who want very little writing - besides the final paper, all you write are precis, which are one page summary things on the readings (very specifically formatted and harder than they sound). Tanoukhi is really intimidating at first - she is clearly an EXTREMELY intelligent person, and so it might seem scary to speak up in class. However, as you continue through the course, she definitely softens up, and she really appreciates if you put in effort to actually understand the material. However, just showing up to office hours unprepared won't do you any good. Take this class if you want to think really deeply and take control of your final paper.

The second and third ultimately surpassed fifteen pages, though I am not sure if that was typical of the rest of the class. There were thirteen required readings, and discussion posts for a grade which accompanied each one. This, along with a group media presentation and a final project presentation, resulted in a fair bit of work. But it was almost always engaging and never over the top nor unnecessary. An emphasis on clarity and concision were very important to me, as this emphasis allowed my writing to be direct and well-targeted. The draft revision process was also encouraged, which is something I had previously disregarded, but revision has made my work much stronger.

Jesus Christ, this class was awful. Not only were the classes themselves bad, the assignments were terrible. He started off the term by reading through the syllabus (a six page document, so it took 2 class periods to get through), and I was like, \"Okay, this seems manageable\". Then he started pushing back the due dates, which is fine, except that they eventually collided in weeks 9 and 10. During the last week of the term, we had rewrites on our 5 page Concept Autobiography and our 8 page ethnography report, plus we had the entirety of a 10 page research paper due. We didn't get any sort of rewrite on the research paper, and the only time we ever talked about it in class was when a research librarian came in a spoke to us about using various search engines.

Second, what the frick does he mean by \"complicate\"? I thought he meant how does it change your perspective of the topic, but apparently not. I asked him about it four times, and he never gave me a straight answer. Oh, and sometimes, he has you meet with him outside of class, to discuss your latest essays and your overall course topic. At our last meeting, in week 9, the purpose of the 30 minutes meeting was to quickly review our previous essays for the rewrites due the next week, and to mostly discuss our research topic. When I went into our meeting, he spent 35 minutes talking about how I could make my first essay, the 5 page Concept Autobiography, better. Now, imagine you're in my position. You're thinking, \"Oh damn, I better rewrite the whole thing, it seems like I'm gonna fail that essay\". At the end of his rant against my paper, he says it's probably in a B+/A- range. He then never mentions my 8 page Ethnography Report, and we spend less than 2 minutes discussing my research paper. Perhaps my experience was a single isolated case, but god DAMN this class was terrible. Genuinely, it almost made me drop out of Dartmouth. It wasn't hard, it was STUPID.

They are genuinely interested in the class's content and literally invest a lot of time doing research and reading the materials. And they got Bs, twice, in writing 2 and 3??? Bs are not bad grades but it was not meant for first-year writing classes at all. Look at the median and my friend's performance. She was so active in the class all and all while no one else gave a shit. THE PROBLEM IS THIS PROF GAVE NO CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK ON WHY THEY GAVE OUT THE GRADE THAT WAY THOUGH.

However, they took WRIT3 with this same person and still get B despite how much effort they have put into and reflected on their writing. I'M SO PROUD OF MY FRIEND. THEIR WRITING IS THE MOST THOUGHTFUL THING. Academic standard-wise, I have nothing to complain about the writing. They used RWIT extensively. The fact this person keeps giving them B (in first-year writing classes wth) says that their teaching is wacked and makes no impact on students' preparation for college writing. My friend did learn a lot. They DESERVED SO MUCH MORE. This prof is a B herself! Anything or anyone is more helpful than her, even a brick.

            "review 2: \"05F with Wendy Piper: The homework for this class was pretty slow paced compared to the other writing 2 classes. You are able to hand in a rough draft before your final grade, which is a big plus. The hour with the T.A. is also great, take advantage of it, try to have your drafts done before you visit with your T.A. Dr. Piper was not everyone's favorite Professor but she's a fair grader. She loves teaching nature.\""

            "review 1: \"09F with Stephanie Boone: There is so much work, but it pays off! Professor Boone is strict, but at the same time, still amazing. She really knows her stuff, and you'll be amazed at how far your writing comes in just one term!\"",
            "review 2: \"07F with Stephanie Boone: Stephanie Boone's class was absolutely something!!! The materials were clearly straight forward to the point of the class. This course was no ordinary course. Prof. Boone assigned different approaches to the writing process and they were so different that you had no clue that some of her projects had a nexus to any sort of writing concept. (Remember that word nexus! if you don't know it, look it up!) She walked us through the analyzing and interrogations of texts, the stimulation of discussion and the freedom of idea. The course title memory, place, and trauma was overwhelming for some, but it clearly forced one to mature and to grasp acclimation to college in a short time span. 10 weeks with Stephanie Boone seems like it lasts a lot longer than one simple term. The TA was also a wonderful contribution to the entire learning process. Just as discussion did, the TA offered another perspective, another story and another friend. I really look forward to Stephanie Boone's course next term and even though it is break, she has us continuing our work. The most important concept is that one gets only what he or she puts into the work. If you put your entire self into the course, you will find yourself faster than expected and your passions will be shining in front of you. YOU will find your strengths and weaknesses and YOU be able to know what you need to succeed at DARTMOUTH regardless of your background and circumstance from which YOU came. I give the course 5 Platinum stars! BE READY FOR WORK!!!\""

            "review 1: \"21F with Kaelin Mackey: DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH THIS PERSON. My friend has such beautiful writings. Okay probably not the best academic writing for a freshman but they definitely improved and I swear it should be FAR better compared to the actual grades they got in the class. They are the most hard-working person I know that actually put that much effort into first-year writing classes. They are genuinely interested in the class's content and literally invest a lot of time doing research and reading the materials. And they got Bs, twice, in writing 2 and 3??? Bs are not bad grades but it was not meant for first-year writing classes at all. Look at the median and my friend's performance. She was so active in the class all and all while no one else gave a shit. THE PROBLEM IS THIS PROF GAVE NO CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK ON WHY THEY GAVE OUT THE GRADE THAT WAY THOUGH. Claiming oh your writing is good and then give you Bs??? Okay, I can still tolerate if that's the B in the first writing class of your college career, it left room for improvement. However, they took WRIT3 with this same person and still get B despite how much effort they have put into and reflected on their writing. I'M SO PROUD OF MY FRIEND. THEIR WRITING IS THE MOST THOUGHTFUL THING. Academic standard-wise, I have nothing to complain about the writing. They used RWIT extensively. The fact this person keeps giving them B (in first-year writing classes wth) says that their teaching is wacked and makes no impact on students' preparation for college writing. My friend did learn a lot. They DESERVED SO MUCH MORE. This prof is a B herself! Anything or anyone is more helpful than her, even a brick. Prof should be transparent about their expectation and this is not a good example. And again, context, in your first-year writing class? I highly doubt you will want someone like this.\""

If you are a freshman and you are unsure as to whether or not your writing is clear, concise, and analytical you should take this course.\""

            "review 1: \"20F with Nick Van Kley: Nick is very smart. He left helpful comments on my drafts and pushed me to tackle more complex questions. Since this class was in the J block, class periods were pretty long. At times it was difficult to stay engaged during his lectures, but he did give us a break each day in the middle of class. I was genuinely interested in the content of this class so I actually enjoyed writing the essays. I definitely recommend getting Nick if you can.\""
